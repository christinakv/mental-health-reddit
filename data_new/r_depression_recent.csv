1mdcizu,"I need tips on how to feel "" not exhausted "" when chatting with my friend with depression","I understand that this might come off as mean and im sorry in advance if it does

I have a friend . she is one of the most amazing, funniest , caring , kindest people iv ever met and I love her so much but lately I have not been able to feel enthusiastic when chatting with her and as much as I hate to admit it its been kinda exhausting 

she has mdd and chronic depression . I completely understand that me and her see things differently and how her brain works differently than mine but despite that iv not been as chatty nor as enthusiastic as I usually am .

  
I want to change and I hate that im feeling this way she is genuinely one of the best people and I think she deserves better

1mdc3c1,i’ve been thinking about ending my life,"i’m an only child, and I just turned 21 today. I hate my life. I feel like my mom hates me. I’m a child of immigrant parents. My mother told me multiple times that her life could’ve been better and happier if I had never been born. And honestly, I agree but it still hurts to hear that from her. She only seems to appreciate me when she needs something, like money. I’ve always supported her and her side of the family (she lives in another country), but it’s never enough. I’m never enough for her, no matter how much I do or give.

she shows more care toward other people than toward me. She calls me selfish but I don’t remember ever saying no to her. When I buy something for myself, she makes me feel guilty and calls me materialistic. My father hasn’t been a good partner to her. He drinks heavily, curses at her, insults her, and yells at her. I’ve been trying so hard to be the best daughter I can because I know she deserves better. I’ve tried to give her everything my father hasn’t, but in the process, i’m losing myself & hating myself even more for not being enough. 

I wish I could be the perfect daughter for her. I truly want the best life for her. I’ve been thinking about ending my pain, but I still think about her. I still need to petition her for a green card. I just want to free myself from all this pain. I wish she never met my dad & I wish I never happened. She’s the only reason why I’m trying to stay alive, but it’s getting harder every day.

1mdbwjc,I'm sick of the never ending cycle.,"I'm sick of feeling so low all the time. I wake up and all I want to do is die.

I know I'm not going to kill myself. I'm not strong willed enough for that. 

I remember when I was a kid I used to wake up and be so excited for the day. But I haven't felt like that in years. All I do is wake up and want it to be bed time already. These feelings aren't fair. And I don't want to feel them anymore.

I just want to be happy. I want to look forward to life. I feel like the things I get sad over aren't that important in the grand scheme of things. It's getting to a point where its so annoying. I wish I would just die already. I don't know what I'm sticking around for.  There's soo much world out there and I'm missing it all by being so sad. I just wish the world would kill me.

I don't know how to find happiness anymore. I don't know what normal is supposed to feel like.

I know I'm allowed to be sad and I'm allowed to be angry but I don't want to be those things anymore. know I can't just change my emotions, and that there's no switch I can flip to feel better but at some point its too much.

All I ever wanted in life was to be happy. ",1753894512.0,2025-07-30 16:55:12+00:00,1,1,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mdbwjc/im_sick_of_the_never_ending_cycle/

I woke up late, missed one college class and decided to just skip the other two. I talked to my friends on call for 2 hours, tried to engage in my main hobby, nothing. I'm just dead inside today.

1mdbdn0,I’m really lonely. Can’t form connections.,"
I'm 21. I have no friends. I'm always by myself and I don't really feel anything anymore I don’t feel alive. There is nothing I can do with anyone in my life. I’m alone. As I look how people are together, I find myself feeling jealous of others often. because I know that no matter what I do, I will never be able to talk and be with them having fun, fall in love, while I never had a Ġ.F in my life and I can’t even makes friends.

I have autism It makes getting to know people more difficult than it should be. I've always battled low self-esteem, which I work hard to improve. My hobbies, including reading and playing video games, art and some more but they no longer seem enjoyable, and I feel as though I will constantly be by myself. I'm not sure if it's to do with depression or loneliness, but I feel this way constantly. when im at home while I'm not working or in class I’m always thinking about why I shouldn't end my life right now.

1mdb64b,its getting out of hand.,"day by day i am realising how brainwashed of a child i was. my family always told me that i was faking it. that i was not actually sad. i had that burning in my stomach as long as i knew myself. ive lost most of my friends. i tried to talk to new people. i tried to help my remaining friends. it doesnt work. nor i can help them or anything i could do helps me cling onto life.

ive tried new interests, hobbies, things that i enjoyed doing, it all feels numb. an action i could take to help/ruin a person feels pointless. the concept of free will doesnt exist because actions have consequences. consequences steer us away from our true selves and intentions. i wore the mask. i wanted to be a good person how much the whispers wanted me to be a bad person. i never felt happy but glad to atleast see people be happy because of me. but im approaching my limit. and the people whom ive helped left me. to my thoughts. i have low pain tolerance so i cant just stab myself to death. i tried. im faithful. i want to be a good servant to my lord. but im terrible under pressure. my family keeps telling me to not be a lazy useless prick and to push forward. it doesnt work. im tired of 'suffer > survive > repeat'. i want a moment of peace. where i dont see nightmares and dont have bad thoughts. i just want to overdose and just die. no one will truly miss me. everyone has a substitute for me. im truly worthless and my existance in the universe is meaningless. i know those who commit suicide burn eternally in hell. i cant keep doing this. or else ill lose my mind and hurt people that i dont want to hurt. i want to die while i am partially functioning.

I feel like this world just keeps getting worse and worse every day. I dont feel like I can have a meaningful impact. and the few times I do have an ounce of self confidence, It immediately gets shredded, so I have devolved to a state of constant depression.

I know what society wants me to do, but the little voice in my head just keeps beating me down till im nothing. and it doesnt go beyond that, im too much of a coward to physically harm myself in anyway, but im too weak to fix my life. I'm on the verge of breaking down every day, I don't know how people cope with this. Things that once brought me a sense of happiness, are just gone.

Honestly I don't know, i like to keep saying that I'm fearless, but I do fear the future, i can't stop thinking about how thing gonna end up, if i actually could get with her again, physically I'm in perfect shape and clean but mentally it's been a war time to time, I don't actually think about ending it all(even if sometimes, just sometimes this idea lurking in my mind), I just wish things would be like 2 years ago.

1md9nkh,Not sure where to go from here,"By all means I’ve had a good run of it through life. My family is very supportive and wants the best for me, I have a good group of guys I could reach out to if I ever wanted to do something or chat and my health has been good. I’ve had a bit of a struggle finding the motivation to get through university so I am a bit behind my high school buddies but that should be nothing. I just don’t see what I’m doing anything for. Why should I deal with anything? The good just doesn’t outweigh the bad.

My parents paid for a trip to Japan with a couple friends and I’m here now. It’s been fun but I don’t think this is enough payoff to get through the rest of the normal days. I like the guys I’m travelling with but I feel like people get under my skin so easily. I don’t know what to do I just slowly grow to hate their mannerisms and how they talk to me. I don’t really know anymore. I don’t like being alone but I don’t like being around anyone it seems. I feel like it’s been that way since I was in middle school. I just can’t find that connection with people.

I don’t know what I’m looking for with this post. I’m sure somebody can relate. Looking for any advice I guess. Unlikely I’ll be able to put it into practice who knows.

1md79ko,Trying to get my life together and now I’m suddenly ill,"I’m 30 years old. I’ve been in a pretty severe depression for over a decade. Recently, my family has been hit hard financially. Everyone is barely holding on. I’ve been wanting to just take my own life for some time now, but I decided to at least try to get a job and help. 

I’ve been applying everywhere. It’s a constant stream of rejection and ghosting. I’m socially anxious, but was forcing myself to walk into stores and give my name to the managers. The stress has been difficult for me. I couldn’t eat more than 500 calories a day. I lost 20 lbs. I started donating plasma just to feel like I was doing something.

Then, out of nowhere, I start getting sick. The most mild physical exertion leaves me breathless, and my lungs feel tired for days afterwards. I start eating more, taking vitamins, trying to fix whatever I’ve done. Nothing is working. Something is very wrong. Bringing in the groceries is like going on a 5 mile run.

I know I’m to blame for this. I always do things at the last minute. It’s just a little cruel that I’m trying to turn things around and now I may not physically be able to. I live in Texas, and based on my current situation there is no way to get insurance. If I walk into a clinic I have no idea what’s going to happen financially. 

Things would be a lot easier if I could press a button to erase myself from the world and everyone’s memories. ",1753883768.0,2025-07-30 13:56:08+00:00,1,0,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md79ko/trying_to_get_my_life_together_and_now_im/
1md762y,I cant live with my failures anymore,"Im 18 still very young and ive failed at every step in life ive always disappointed my parents who mean the most to me. I don't have any achievements that can make them proud of me they feel ashamed introducing me to others.

And now to top it all off I've reached the biggest failure in my life by not getting into any good university, I had such a long time and many options but what did I do? What I have always done, wasted time and ended up failing again I didn't make it into any good uni, everyone around me did everyone is celebrating and excited and here I am in my bundle of regrets and disappointments. I am glad for them but deep down it kills me only because of what my parents feel. I feel like there is no future ahead of someone like me someone who always looks for an easy way out and never works hard. 

I don't blame anyone but myself and I want to die to put myself and my family out of this misery, if I dont live they wouldn't have anything to be ashamed of. Imagine all the failures I will accumulate in the future I could save them from all of that by just dying.

Week later I thought I got this I have so much to live fore I found the gym helped I finally got sleep but not much because every dream had her in it and woke me up

By the weekend my friends moved on and were tired of my shit I feel good for little then spiral in to the pain

The next week shit hit the fan and I felt everything in me die 
That finally hit its conclusion this week where everything is able to be destroyed mutually but every branch I had to grab is gone

How do I feel today

I feel that pain still deep inside its smaller but stronger. It eats at my thoughts it eats at me. I feel dead I still barely sleep I wake up and can’t go back to bed

My partner of 15 years has been growing distant, and I’m honestly surprised she’s still with me. I started working in my 20s doing data entry. In my 30s, I got involved in drug dealing. It was ok for a while, but eventually I got into legal trouble. Wanting to turn things around, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp for web development. I completed the program, but couldn’t land an entry level job. After years of trying, I’ve mostly given up on that path. I still code for fun and enjoy it, but it doesn’t pay the bills. I managed to find a job as a cook for two years until the restaurant shut down in 2023. Since then, I’ve been actively looking for any kind of work, but haven’t had any luck. Each day, I feel more depressed. I lack motivation, my health is declining, and I feel like I’ve lost all hope. It’s hard to see a future for myself. I’ve had thoughts about the inevitable many times.

1md6fzf,I think I‘m suicidal right now?,"I never made active plans and I still haven’t made any active plans and I probably won’t do it because I have a pet and friends and all. Still I have suicidal thoughts and my depression is almost unbearable right now and I am sick of people telling me it will get better because I‘ve been struggling with my mental health for ten years now. I am sick of people telling me they understand if they haven’t even seen half of what I‘m feeling. I‘m sick of people brushing it off as „just another bad day“ because they are so used to me not feeling good that they don’t seem to notice when it’s urgent. It is urgent. And I talked to a professional yesterday saying that I‘m not sure how urgent it is but that it feels urgent and that I wonder just how long I can still take this and she didn’t fucking realize how serious I am?? Do people really have to commit for others to see how serious it was? 
I feel really fucking alone in this and so damn frustrated because nothing seems to really help - just short term like a bandage. Life feels meaningless lately, just the hope that I‘ll someday find meaning in it again keeps me somewhat going. Life feels so meaningless and all I feel is grief for the things long gone and two loved ones that passed away and all else I feel is anxiety of the future with all the political turmoil and uncertainty. And I feel beyond miserable and I cry and cry and sometimes even silently scream and oh do I want to really scream out loud but I can’t - I always somewhat hold my pain back. And I don’t feel truly seen in this. People probably think I‘m just „moderately depressed“ just like I always am and since I‘ve been managing it all for so long (again, 10 years) they probably thing I‘ll always manage it.
It feels so overwhelming, I‘m laying in bed right now, having cried again and again not even certainly knowing if I‘m suicidal or not. I know that for me it’s not that I truly want to die, as for many suicidal people, we just don’t want this pain anymore. But how fucking long do I have to wait till I can finally say I‘m happy?? Some in between moments are okay and yes I laugh and have fun with friends occasionally, does it mean I‘m not as depressed?? Isn’t high functioning depression a thing? Didn’t Kurt Cobain also occasionally have fun? 
I feel irritated lately and angry and I rarely felt that in the past years but I am so sick of always having to hold it together. I‘m so sick and tired of waiting for people to see me, to truly see my pain and to comfort me and to just be truly present. 
I‘m trying to rationally think about reasons to stay alive and to want and stay alive. There sure are many reasons; such as my pet, my friends, my family, the chance that maybe I could make a career of what I love, the chance to help animals and people. I can rationally tell myself „hey maybe it will get better and you’ll be glad you stayed alive“. 
But emotionally it all doesn’t hold as much power right now. 
So please, if anyone here that’s been feeling like this and has truly come out of this knows just what to say then I would appreciate it. I don’t want to get to the point where I truly don’t care anymore if I take my life or not. Right now I do still have maybe 2% of fighting in me, I can’t lose that.

And sometimes, even though I try so hard to stay strong and survive whatever life throws at me… I still feel like a burden.
I feel like I’m constantly fighting battles no one sees. It gets lonely. I don’t want to complain, and I don’t want pity. I just want to know… does anyone else feel like this? How do you keep going when you feel so heavy inside? And how long will it lasts?

1md4q19,I wish I was never born,"I've tried. But I am tired. I am tired to wake up every single day, regretting that I did not die in my sleep. Regretting that I have to survive another day while I am already rotting inside. I guess that life doesn't love every person that exists. It would explain tragedies and accidents, and it would explain why some are happy while others suffer. Those lucky enough will be able to enjoy life, but those others will only continue limping towards their true peace.

I was afraid my whole life that I will die alone. That I will be trapped in my own mind with nobody to be there for me. And I guess that this is the only way my life will end no matter what I do. I know people would tell me to only care and think about myself. But I want to be understood too. I can't love myself. No matter how hard I have tried, I cannot bring myself to love me. It's impossible to accomplish when I am aware of the fact that nobody ever loved me either. And if nobody did, why would I? Maybe I am not worth loving. When everyone has the same oppinion on you, then maybe you truly are the problem. So why would you think different?

Though, it does hurt me. I have tried myself to be a good person. I know I wasn't the best, but I wasn't the worst either. I was just human. But for whatever reason, I wasn't treated like a human. Seen as a freak by everyone, abandoned when I was getting attached, isolated from the whole society. My whole existence did not matter to anyone. It was ignored, like a meaningless parasite of the world. How much I have tried to feel like I belong somewhere. Like I found a person that would notice that I am alive too. I didn't ask for love or best friends or a family of my own. Just one single person to notice my existence. To feel like I am alive here as well. But no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up alone in my own thoughts.

I guess that people are right. You can't save everyone. And maybe I wasn't even worth trying to be saved. To be shown that I am human as well. To feel like I am worth something. Like I can do something myself. Maybe in the end, those born as a nobody will forever remain that way.

1md49e4,I just don’t know anymore,"Thought I’d give going on a rant on reddit a shot.

I don’t even know where to begin to be honest. I guess I can just start with the most obvious, I have severe depression (who could’ve guessed). I’ve had severe depression for as long as I can remember, which isn’t saying much because I also have a dissociative disorder, which in turn makes my memory that of a goldfish’s and causes me to lose my fucking mind.

I guess it all started when I was young, like single digits, and I was sexually abused by a family member. As I grew up, I started to realise what had happened and I think that’s when I became depressed, honestly I’ve been like this for so long that it just feels like I was born wanting to end it all. 

I’ve had multiple attempts to leave this life, all 10 have clearly failed. I have been contemplating whether I should try again or not, but even kms just sounds tedious at this point. I don’t have the motivation to do anything, I don’t have any dreams or aspirations. The meds aren’t helping anymore, the distractions aren’t distracting. The voices in my head are getting louder and more obnoxious, the psychologist appointments are getting annoying. 

I just want to escape this life, go to a different world or something. Although at this point I don’t even know if that would change anything.

Idk what I going on with my mind. It keeps getting harder each day, negetive thoughts keep getting more and more. Idk why am I scared for myself and unable to do anything. Lost the girl I fell I love with that affected me so much along with everything else. I haven't been able to work for last 4-5 years. Had been in severe depression post covid and thought I lost everything my life and gave up all hopes. Was just passing my time. Then I started to get a little better atleast mentally. But I wasn't earning anything. I wanted to do something but I couldn't. Would alway think negatively as soon as something I should be doing. Idk why has my thoughts become like this. And then I distract myself with other things a movie or something else something random. I know I was smarter before and now I feel like my brain has become slower as well. While I want to earn respect for myself and money for myself, Idk why I am unable to do it I keep wasting time even when I know I shouldn't and it's eating me up from inside 24x7. I feel useless and scared all the time. People say start small do something small and I know they are right but I don't how to explain how hard it has become to do something small as well. I don't know what to do. As if in my mind I know I should be running towards working for something for myself but I feel my body is chained down and it hurts a lot. It's really hard to explain this. As if I have min stop brain fog. I feel like I want to escape from this world. Run away somewhere else. but at the same time somewhere I also want to fight for myself. I know this is contradictory but my feelings and thoughts have been jumping up and down for such a long time. Even for small decisions of day to day life to big decisions.

1md3w01,I feel abandoned amd numb,"Sorry if this is too long. My entire life has been full of struggles, I have never gotten the things that I wanted. 6 years ago I started a fresh career without any prior training or study, consider myself to be naturally good at it. No matter the talent, I haven't been able to get to a good position even after working professionally for 5 years. It's not because I'm dumb or lazy, but just because I never got a good opportunity and felt that some power is working against me, plus the last 3 companies that I worked at all closed down. So last year I decide to do a masters abroad and away from my home, I took a huge loan and started my studies hoping that things would look better, everyone in the class told me how good I was, both as a person and a professional. Forward to April, my girlfriend back home broke up with me, while I was grieving for that and applying for internships for graduating I got 3 offers and all of them retracted because of the visa process.

So now while almost everyone in the class with my experience similar to me has got an internship, I am stuck here with no hope of getting one, failed relationship, and in a huge debt.
I feel like a failure, all this potential and just because of streak of bad lucks I'm here directionless and numb, don't have a clue what to do and why this is happening to me.

I used to be a spiritual person, but for the past couple weeks I have a heart sinking feeling of being forsaken by the higher power.

1md3abu,Why is my life a never ending cycle of losing,"For context: I was in a Uni in the UK on an international scholarship and I’m from a different country. 

Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make sure I hadn't died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. I was stuck in a stuffy room with not much sunlight or privacy just alone with myself, with a psyche which slowly crumbled. The new medicine made me unlike myself. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by scraping my arms and legs with scissors, keys and forks. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Lucy (19F) let’s say. After staying in the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She has BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk (I never drink) as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I was blind thought she was sweet and amazing, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she decides to stay with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Lucy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when I reach the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency room. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Lucy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions. But while this was happening, Lucy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on the street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Lucy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hang out together and love each other. I help her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feelings better. But then two nights before I left, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drank too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy, in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while, thinks she hurt me and tries to kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. I'm still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puking but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately got my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Lucy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to my home country he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go by and I keep in regular contact with Lucy and a friend: Eric (40M). Lucy is staying with Eric temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m just unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Lucy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty thing and making me feel fucking awful. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Eric drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person and that it’s my fault this is happening to her. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Lucy messed Eric up and he tried to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combating trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I was made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which padding and chains to the wall. It was so fucking scary.. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me to the hospital but he was getting mad that we had to wait even though it’s normal. So he burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor rudely then left. After my appointment, he was screaming about how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum while I’m physically aging my head in front of him because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my younger brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I'd take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self a lot of days. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad.

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. Right now I’ve been on new medicine and I’m more my normal self after that period of being on that bad medication.

I keep thinking bad thoughts. Like ending it. That I’ve got future. That I’m stupid and ugly and useless. That I will be nothing. I have such intense self hatred I want to kill it by killing me. I just want to be loved, is that so hard?? So somebody can prove to me that I am worth something more than fuck all. I know it’s unhealthy, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know at all. Fuck me. This is the third time and most intense time. I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 14 managed to bring myself back from the edge and improve only to go through hell at 17 in a college course that made people actively want to kill themselves, only to somehow work hard through it while being nearly homeless for a time, financially, emotionally absurd, and lack of food, to this. I work so damn hard. Why the fuck does this keep happening to me. I know I’m not special so how the fuck does this happen. 

I’m sorry. I’m exhausted. I’m thinking bad things. It’s nearly 2am for me. I was thinking of Lucy. I missed feeling like I was worth something even if it was from somebody as toxic as her. Now I doom scroll dating subreddits to fill a hole I know can’t be filled by another person. But I keep thinking so anyways. I’m tired of living. I’ve seen enough and time and time again I get beat down. My whole life. What do you think that teaches me? That no matter what I do, all my hardwork will amount to nothing, that all my actions are meaningless because it’ll end this way and there’s no point living. Help me. I don’t know how to help myself. Why can’t I love me. That’s all I want. I want to cry. But the meds keep me from doing so. I want to fucking die so bad

Some might say “it’s never too late” or something along those lines, I would say that to someone else, but it’s not true. I live alone, have no friends, no kids, no pets, no nothing and have made zero progress towards changing any of that for 20 years. I’ve been such a pathetic failure for so long that even if I believed it was possible for things to change, there’s not enough time.

1md2op0,Lack of support from spouse,"
Had a mental breakdown in 2019 that led to a hospitalization. I was diagnosed bipolar 2, major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. It cost me my job and I was able to find work again (I worked in a niche industry) but I struggled to hold down a job. You know how hard it is to even complete basic tasks when depression hits. Well, I got fired another 2 times. I was a really good salesman and I lost all confidence in my abilities. I became physically fearful (I guess anxiety) of facing the same customers I'd been dealing with for 20 years. I Left my job and the industry I'd worked in for 20 years and bought a business in a new industry.  It started odd well but I've watched it slowly shrink as I struggle to perform consistently. 

We have a daughter that I love and who loves me. I can't afford therapy and I use long and tedious government medical system to get medication. Therapy with them is a no go as you have to wait 3 months to speak to someone and they're so overwhelmed, they couldn't be bothered to care. It's difficult to say if the meds work because I haven't had a manic attack since I went on them but the depression is as bad as ever. 

My job allows me to get my daughter ready for school and to fetch her after. I know how hard it is for my wife with me struggling and I try to help at home but some days I just can't manage to do anything. 

I love my wife and I see what this is doing to her. It's been 6 years of this with no end in sight. She's a strong person but she can only be strong for so long before she too starts cracking. Well, that already happened - I feel like she resents me. We're not connected any more. We haven't even been intimate in a year. When things get too much for her, she'll snap and we'll fight. I've given up trying to explain that I'm struggling because she thinks it's just some sort of excuse. 

I thought about ending things in 2021 and scared myself into a 72 hour suicide hold at the psych ward because of how calm and retionally I was planning it. What worries me is I'm having those thoughts again. I just know that the only thing keeping me alive is the financial impact it will have on my family. I haven't even got any life cover and (during mania in 2019) I racked up massive debt that I still haven't cleared. That will fall on my wife and daughter. But it hurts so much because I feel they'd be better off if I wasn't here. 

I'm not sure why I wrote this post. Probably because I don't have anyone I can talk to. This is my first post. Man, I don't know anymore ",1753870204.0,2025-07-30 10:10:04+00:00,4,2,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md2op0/lack_of_support_from_spouse/

1md2hz4,Antidepressant Experience with Citalopram,"After moving around for the last few years, I've finally been able to have regular contact with a psychologist, and they have prescribed me the antidepressant citalopram (20mg).

I'm on my second week, and so far, I don't feel a notable difference apart from some strange (but amusing) dreams and a slight improvement in my focus and appetite. I was told that it would take 4-6 weeks to really take effect, so I'm assuming this is normal for this stage.

Unless there's a dramatic difference between my current state and the post-6-week stage, I might ask them to increase the dosage or try another drug. I know this works via the SSRI route, and I like the *idea* of having more serotonin in circulation because I tried ecstasy once and it was genuinely one of the best experiences of my life. So, if I can get close to having that feeling on a daily basis (obviously not to the same degree), then I think it would improve things.

I'm an incompetent idiot, it's amazing that i can live like this and not feel ashamed. 17 years of living, all squandered away on who knows what, it's impressive that i've lived that long and not done anything remotely remarkable. At my core, im just a somehow loved waste of money, time, and energy; though i feel i deserve nothing from hatred from my parents.

My government have broke me. There's talks everywhere of the online safety act and how awful it is. Everyday I look on Twitter or Reddit for updates things just get worse and worse. The world is becoming an Orwellian nightmare and none of us are able to wake up from it. I have no passion anymore. What's the point when everything seems so hopeless? I find myself waking up depressed, taking hours to get up. All the other times I'm just laying around staring at either the wall or the ceiling. I'm having constant anxiety attacks, even at work. I just can't enjoy anything anymore, and I wish it would just end already.

1md1bbl,Broken. (Vent),"Things have gotten better, I’ve just gotten out of a toxic living situation with my grandparents, in a new apartment, and things have been going good so far, I feel safer and more at peace…but deep down I’m still feeling depressed, I’m missing love and friendship…all of my life I have felt like an outcast, no one has ever wanted to date me or even be friends with me. I have dated guys before but they have never really cared about me. I feel broken at this point, I just wish I could find something real, I feel like I’m going to be alone the rest of my life, people keep saying to never give up and keep trying but I don’t know how much longer I can keep trying to put myself out there because no matter how much I try to sugarcoat myself and try to be more likable/charismatic no one is ever interested. And like I don’t expect everyone to be interested and I know I’m not everyone’s type but… I would just like to know the feeling of someone else caring about me or at least for someone to give me a chance. I know no one is perfect, we all have flaws…but it feels like nobody can look past mine and see me for me. And for the friends part of this equation I’ve never had any real friends I’ve tried like hell to make friends, be social, put myself out there, get to know people, and hang out but it has never worked out. I don’t even know how these relationships work because I’ve never had any. I’ve always felt like alienated all of my life throughout school and stuff like I’ve never belonged in any group or social circle, it’s always just felt like I’ve just been existing instead of actually living, like being a background character in everyone else’s life, I’ve just always felt out of place in every situation and everywhere, the only person who hasn’t made me feel like an outsider is my mom, but that’s like a parents job ig. 
I think I will always be broken, I’m not posting this to be dramatic or to seek empathy from others, I just need to let it out because I literally have no one I can talk to and be honest with.

Men are not cared about enough in this world compared to women especially if you’re ugly or don’t fit in and that’s why a lot of men take their own lives because they suffer more.

1md0t5z,I am beyond broken. So why do I keep enduring?,"[17f] So I've made it into a prestigious univeristy. I have inflicted so much pain towards myself, trying to be better, getting better.

The reason why I haven't thrown myself off rails was because I wanted to give a better life to my most special person, a life that I never had. Every night, I get panic attacks and I feel nauseous. It feels like there is fire on my skin. I am never breathing properly.

At only 9 years old, I began to have psychosis and CPTSD. There are memories I try to block away. Being doxxed online, being molested by an instructor, being raped and recorded, spat on and getting abused and hurt everyday, began drinking at 13, smoking,vaping, doing hard drugs at only 16 and burning myself with a lighter, now being on medication at 17 that makes me feel like a post-lobotomy woman. 

My mom and dad isn't by my side. I don't have ""daddy"" anymore, mom is rarely around and I can't stop crying while writing this, it makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed I amso ashamed and I don't have a single person in this world to lay down all my worries on. 

I never had an adult to give me wise words. I don't think I am smart, just hard working and retrying. Hurting and not knowing how to heal myself. Crying many hours in the restroom and then walking outside in professional character. Who am I supposed to be? Why am I not allowed to be angry? Why do I have to calm down? Why am I not allowed to hate the person that hurt me over and over and over? 

Don't tell me I am not alone, because I AM alone. I have had so much genuine empathy for those around me, despite all my emotions being numbed and having to fake every facial expression, because I have felt pain in my life before and I CARE. Recently, I have lost a lot of weight. I am not well. I am beyond broken, but no one understands my pain. I am not ready to be a parent. I am not ready to go far away. I am so so scared, so tired of everything.

1md0ikb,I want to die. Literally just wanna shoot my brains out.,"Life is hard. For everyone I know. But they are able to go through it, it seems. And it just seems so unbearable for me. Really, I'm even ashamed of complaining now. An exhausted failure by design. But what else do I do? It just feels like I wanna scream and scream and die out of exhaustion.

I don’t wanna tell much about my personal life, but my parents are great. They did and still do so much for me. And I'm here like a cripple. 

Money, money, money.... I cannot seem to solve this problem. There's this need in me to be independent in a way that I never depend on anyone ever. Doing that feels like being a failure and a cripple. But I'm dependent and I don't see a way out of this. I wanna be autonomous.

The world demands so much even for you to worth anything in all aspects– money to relationships to the freedom to just live as you want. And I get it. But it feels so unfair to be born and thrown into this shit where you have no choice but to go through this.

I'm from a shitty place. And I always wanted to move from here. But now it just feels so out of reach. I'm twenty five. I sometimes try to be hopeful and think I'll figure something out, but then I look at my life....

Nothing really matters in the big picture ofcourse. I'm just 1 in 8 billion, dead or alive, happy or sad, living or surviving. So many people are dying being forgotten, going through unimaginably worse shit than me, nothing changes. People come, people do. The world runs the same. I don't even know why I write this stuff. I write poetry and shit that no one could care less about. Which is fair to be honest. 

But for now, living the way you, whatever you are, want if you're alive feels like it does matter, or else life doesn't seem to worth or mean anything.

BE EXCEPTIONAL OR ADAPT seems to be the slogan of the world. And I'm neither one of those. ",1753861821.0,2025-07-30 07:50:21+00:00,5,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md0ikb/i_want_to_die_literally_just_wanna_shoot_my/

1md06t1,Doomed self-awareness,"This will most likely be all over the place. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe just a place to vent to the abyss.

I've been dealing with depression since I was 9-10 years old. I was always the quiet kid, never had many friends, and felt things too hard. Stuck in my mind 24/7. Barely left my house. This loneliness caught up to me when I actually became aware of it. I finally noticed how the other kids didn't have the same problems that I did. They had friends; they would go out with them and their families. They had lives, multi-faceted lives. 

I always felt I didn't have that.

This self-awareness was probably triggered by a discussion I had with a boy from my class. It was a Catholic school, and I was a pretty edgy kid. He asked if I had made a deal with the devil, and the other kids agreed. It's pretty silly to think about it now, but back then that made me actually look around for the first time and see how cut off I was from the rest of them. That stuck with me.

I didn't have someone to talk about it with, so it snowballed. I became unhappy with myself, not that I was truly happy to begin with, and I wallowed in my despair. Then it became suicidal. I felt I was a burden, so I started planning to stop being a burden. Never actually attempted, but I had the plans, just in case.

I finally asked to see a psychologist when I was 11, even if I felt I got over it. Now I know I never outgrew it like I thought I did; it just became my new normal, and I didn't remember how I felt before it started anymore.

The psychologist I saw didn't do anything, really. I talked to her and told her everything; she tried to teach me some breathing exercises to calm myself and then asked for some kind of hormonal tests (something like that). She asked to speak with my mother alone when I brought the tests, so I just waited outside and didn't get to actually talk to her. My mom just told me she saw the tests and said everything was fine, and I never saw her again.

That was it.

I just learned to live with it. Still lonely, still no friends, still no life, still empty. Covid hit when I was 14, and that was one of my happiest years, even when my father died halfway through it. I didn't have to leave my house anymore, so I was fine. I felt fine, normal.

The years passed. Suddenly I was 17, in the last year of high school. Nothing really changed in my mind.

I had friends now, though, finally. That made things a tiny bit better, even if I felt I was a burden to them most of the time.

One of them used to say I was like a ticking time bomb. I could explode at any moment over anything.

This is something I didn't mention until now. The anger. I am a really angry person when I actually feel some kind of emotion.

I knew something was wrong with me. Now it wasn't just other people's lives that I compared with myself; now it included school. I was always bad at math, even basic shit, but that increased tenfold after the pandemic. I tried teaching myself, my friends tried teaching me, nothing helped, so now I was even more stressed. 

I wanted to see another psychologist again. But this time I couldn't. I was completely dependent on my immediate family to get one for me, and they barely gave a shit. 

So I just had to accept their excuses for the time being.

I then managed to get into a public university right after finishing high school.

So I was pretty lucky when my university offered free mental help.

There, the therapist wanted to send me to a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist for better care. But they didn't have that, so I had to look elsewhere.

So I did the only thing I could; with the documentation in hand, I made enough fuss to get my nurse aunt (my uncle's girlfriend) involved, and she actually stepped up to help me. Got me everything except the neuropsychologist.

So, I'll jump to the present day. I study and work now and got a scholarship, so I get some money for myself to not be fully dependent on my family anymore, because I learned from my mistakes. I still have one of my friends. I should be okay now.

Not really.

I'm 19 now.

I'm still unhappy with myself.

I struggle with university, through all fault of my own. I lack motivation, I lack care, and I don't take care of myself. I starve myself because I can't bring myself to care. I stopped taking my meds for depression and anxiety because I have to buy them, but I don't care. I feel nothing, and when I feel it, it's anger, almost debilitating anger, or sadness.

I fucking hate myself. 

And I'm fully aware of it.

All of my troubles are caused by myself. Stressed because I have essays to write and other work to send? I procrastinated until the very last day because I live in executive dysfunction. Couldn't get the obligatory internship that I need? I was scared, so I pushed it. You get the idea.

I know that I cause my own problems, and what do I do to solve them? Nothing.

Not sure how to end this. My life is not that bad, and yet I thrive in making it worse.",1753860506.0,2025-07-30 07:28:26+00:00,2,1,depression,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md06t1/doomed_selfawareness/

1mcz4os,I'm fine but I still don't want to live,"I was diagnosed with major depresive  disorder last year. I do talk to a therapist and take meds. But other than that I don't really talk about in general or the fact that I still feel like I don't wanna live. I'm not actively suicidal, and I don't really plan to kill myself but I just don't like living. Everything is fine and my life generally speaking is not bad. So I don't know why I still feel this way. I wanna talk to someone who isn't my therapist about how I actually feel. I go to work and school, I try cause I know that's what is expected of me. But I genuinely don't want to deal with any of this. It's like the  stupid question of what do you want/ to do? 
- it's hard to answer that question when I don't really want to live. 
Things have gotten better, I feel better but I... Still don't see a reason or have a feeling of I look forward to my future. To what I can do. If I'm being completely honest, I wish didn't have to lie when people ask me that. But can I really say,  oh actually I don't even wanna live, I wish I would be dead. I wish, to do nothing, not working, not wake up, or get up, eat, Etc. 

If I could I would just lay down maybe paint but even then most of the time I don't Do That.  But it's hard. It's hard to explain that feeling, yeah I can sometimes enjoy doing things but most of the time I don't. And yes I have tried changing my perspective, being more greatful, cheerful all these things yet, that numb, empty feeling remains. 

 When I think ugh I wish I wouldn't wake up or get up. Most people just don't like their job or are just saying it as an exaggeration. But I mean it, most days when I open my eyes, I dread the fact that I woke up. It's not because of my job or school. And I want to talk to some about this.

so why doesn't it feel real?

you know, I was feeling completely normal just a few moments ago. but then, it's like it all dropped at me at once. And now tears are falling from me face, and I don't know why.

I don't want to slip backwards. I'm making progress, aren't I? I can get better, can't I? Right??

Or am I just distracting myself? Bottling up my emotions, like I used to do all the time? 

It's like my happiness is so fragile I have to live on the edge, avoiding any speck of negativity in the world.

until I accidentally get too close to the edge.

and I fall, feeling the depths of sadness starting to envelope me again.

I need to stop it.

but how?

that's the thing.

my depression is a part of my brain. there is no getting rid of it. there is no escaping it. there is no fixing it.

there's just running from it while hoping I don't trip.

but when I do trip, FUCK is it soul crushing.

I need to get up. I need to start running again. 

But I just want to sob.",1753853756.0,2025-07-30 05:35:56+00:00,6,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcydqh/no_matter_how_far_ahead_i_get_depression_seems_to/
1mcy566,I just wanna be with my family again,"Hi, I don't really know how to start this off but for context I am sixteen years old and a month after I turned 15 I had to move out. My older sisters and grandma's decided that it would be better for me and my other sister to go stay at my grandmas for a while because things weren't going well at home. My grandma owns an apartment building sort of so they set up one of the rooms for me and my sister to stay in. It was only supposed to be for a week so that my parents could maybe fix things, but it's been well over a year now. Things have always been rough at home but in the past few years it had really started getting bad to the point it was effecting our health not only mentally but physically. My parents constantly fought both verbally and sometimes physically, and our house was not suitable to live in. It still isn't.
Living at my grandmas has helped me be alot healthier and taken me out of my depression for the most part. It was hard at first and some days it gets bad but it was alot better than what it was like living there. Recently though, it hasn't been very good. My sister just graduated highschool and she has moved to another state with her bf. I am very happy for her and I am really excited that she gets to finally get out. But now I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm all alone. I know I have a lot of people in my life that love and support me but it's not the same as having someone that's really with you and sees what's going on. Siblings moving out is hard for everyone especially the youngest kids, I know that but now I'm completely alone. I just wanna live with my family again. Even if I could just live with my dad I think it'd be better. While my sister was here I still had feelings of loneliness but she was there to help me. 
I don't know if maybe I'm just dramatic because I know people have it a lot worse but I wish I could have a happy family in a clean nice home. But I know I can't have that. It just hurts when I get up in the morning to an empty home and when there's no one to ask me how my day was when I get home from school or work. Or when I have to make myself dinner even if I'm really tired. A few weeks ago I had a dream that I was back home with my family and I was younger and it felt so happy. When I woke up I was really excited but once I realized where I was I just felt hopeless. I couldn't get out of bed except to go to the bathroom. It used to be when I felt like this or I couldn't sleep at night because of it, I would go sleep in my sisters bed and cry in her arms. But now I can't and I can't call her because it's not the same and I don't want her to worry. 
My dad wants me to live with him again and I really want to also but the house is even worse then when we left and because of the mold and bugs and mice I can't go back there. My mom lives with her friend and I can sleep over there somtimes but its not the same. I just wish I could have my own room in a house with my family and my dogs and I wish it could be clean and I wish I didn't have to feel scared. 
I have always had trouble sleeping because I jsut can't stop thinking and once I do sleep I have nightmares. I know that I'm sixteen and I shouldn't cry about nightmares anymore but it scares me. And because I live alone now when I wake up I still don't feel safe. 
I don't know I just wanna feel loved again. ",1753852909.0,2025-07-30 05:21:49+00:00,4,0,depression,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcy566/i_just_wanna_be_with_my_family_again/
1mcy3o7,Losing All Hope,"I've been silently struggling for the most part of my life. Didn't have a proper school life due to my avoidance caused by speech blocks and also bullying by the teachers. 

I didn't have the usual timeline followed by the majority of people, school to college to career then marriage, family etc. I spent a lot of time doing things on my own, trying to do courses online and I have so many certificates. Due to financial issues, I got my degree at a later age. I was losing confidence because of a lack of a degree but now that I have it and I have done well in it, I feel even more low because that alone isn't enough. Those around me are having Masters, PhD and so on. I don't feel enough.

Firstly, I wanted a degree to get back my confidence. I don't believe in doing things to show the world. Of course, I'd be happy to flaunt my credentials, but that's not my primary goal. I wanted to regain control over my thoughts on my own self. I wanted to see myself in a better way. I hate it when people do things to fit in with the society.

Now, I'm unable to land myself any jobs. It's either far from my place or they want me to do max for low pay. This is affecting my confidence level and I've started to feel anxious and I'm experiencing speech blocks more than usual. I feel like crying as I'm typing this. 

Just had an argument with my partner about my degree. My primary goal was get a degree to feel better about myself and also use that to get more career opportunities. My partner is like, you don't get degrees to keep them to yourself, you have to do a degree that's worth obtaining, I can't even wrap my head around what we argued on, my mind is too full of sadness and frustration.

I'm trying but nothing's working. I do have plans to get a higher degree once I start earning more steadily and I know the field too, but with my current state of mind and the blocks, being a teacher isn't easy. I'm unable to say my name at times, I'm unable to say certain words, teachers are expected to take charge of matters, but I'm more of a backstage worker, I don't like the spotlight, but I enjoy teaching, but that's also getting me anxious. I can't always be anticipating things and be nervous. Those who see me feel that I have a perfect life, perfect personality. I'm unable to be myself due to my blocks.

Now the degree that I have, I'm left to compare it with others, feeling inadequate. I put my heart and soul into getting this degree and I'm proud of the path I've taken after what I've experienced in life, but without money, a career that pays you that money, nobody would respect you. Where there's money, there goes the respect and admiration.

I had the skills but everybody who wanted to hire me wanted a degree, now that I have it after putting in so much of effort, now I'm made to feel that it's not enough, you need to do more or gain more credentials, Masters. I'm yet to earn the money that was spent on my first degree, I need to have some savings and then proceed to do the next degree, but I feel that nothing's enough. My achievements are nothing. I feel inadequate. Those without any credentials are teaching, conducting classes, and I'm struggling in life. I'm always having second thoughts about my own potentials.

I wish I just disappeared or never existed. Why does life have to be different for me over the years and difficult even after these many years? I'm exhausted. I feel stagnant. I envy those in other fields who are easily (I mean skills and degrees that helps them land jobs) able to earn, buy houses, pay bills, travel around, in short, have a stable career. I have been doing what I'm great at, with no savings, no career placements, no career progress, nothing.

I can sing, dance, write, design modules, plan lessons, teach with a passion, but stuck in many ways. I feel frustrated and I'm losing hope.",1753852765.0,2025-07-30 05:19:25+00:00,3,0,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcy3o7/losing_all_hope/

1mcwzzn,It’s a scam but it’s ok I guess,"Just weird how you can be aware of your depression and make changes to combat it, but can’t change the inner desire to feel miserable. But that desire exists only because so much of life is a lie. Things don’t always sort themselves out, there really is no happy ending for normal people, there’s no silver lining behind the pain you feel, it’s having a mind that begs for attention but only in isolation. Really it’s like a reverse narcissism where everything that you think is programmed to somehow make you the villain in your head, putting yourself in the center of it. And then you hate yourself more for doing that. It’s like a snake eating itself and growing back at the same time. Love isn’t love it’s compromise. Happiness isn’t a real thing it’s just not being depressed.

Everything I think is in the title.

Today life is better. Health is way better, have a cool job, started to go to the gym. Recently wanted to start to date. But I realized that most of the women of my age already had at least relationship. That's not a bad thing, women are allowed to be with as many people as they want, but as I continued to date I started to question myself.

What’s the point ? I want to love someone deeply, very, very truly. But the average women of my age has so much more experience than me. I wont ever be her first one, that one guy, I will never be as special as her as she is to me. That’s not an accusation, It’s stupid to judge people based on their previous relationships. But that’s a fact. If I was gay I would say the same about men.

It broke something in me. I will never be able to live what I wanted to live so deeply, to experience something so special with someone else. I know you can love someone very intensely the second time, but that’s not the same sparkle anymore in my opinion.

Honestly and I feel very surprised and ashamed of myself, but since that realisation a few months ago, it feels like everything is pointless. I stopped doing things, lost my drive.

1mcwg07,I am ending myself tomorrow,"For background, my fiancé (T) who I had been with for two and a half years had secretly never broken up with his ex (J) who he told me he broke up with after J cheated on him. And about two weeks ago on the 18th, J and I both found out. T and I were visiting his grandparents out of state, which was also the state J lived in. We had also visited them last summer too, and J came over to visit last year too, but as far as I knew T just stayed friends with J after the “breakup”. And as far as J knew, T and I were “just friends”. And T knew, especially after some drama and fights happened last year, that I wasn’t comfortable with J coming over and spending several nights again. And, on the 18th, J found out T had been dating me and engaged to me. And T chose to break things off with me to stay with J. I can kind of understand why he chose him, since J and T had been together for about ~3-4 years and the state J and T’s grandparents lived in was the state T and I were always talking about moving to and planning on moving in a year after I graduate university. But it still hurts so fucking much. And I still love him. I even told him I’d be fine with transferring to a college in the state we were planning on moving right now if he’d take me back. We were planning out our lives together. And I can’t imagine a future without him. T just flew back in tonight (I’m a 20 yo college student, and he’s 19 so we both still live with our families. I went back home from our trip the morning after everything happened). And Friday he leaves to go move in with J. So tomorrow, I’m gonna go see him, say my peace, and go home.

I didn't really understand what I was dealing with or that I needed to seek help until I was around 22 years old. It was around that time I first opened up to my parents, but I don't think they grasped how bad I was feeling.

Since then I've seen several psychiatrists and been on a variety of medications and combinations of medications. Some seem to provide a temporary lift, but the weight of the depression is always present. It's really just always feeling bad, with weeks and months of feeling especially bad. The last few years I've worked with a few therapists, but I don't find their guidance very helpful. I'm told that I need to go on daily walks, practice deep breathing, and spend time daily reframing my thoughts. This may be helpful for some, but I feel my issues are deeper and require really unpacking and understanding why I feel the way I do.

The past 8 years or so I've been more open with my parents about what I'm dealing with. They are the only support I have. Recently they noticed I've been especially quiet, closed off, and irritable when they try to ask how I'm doing. 

I have considered an inpatient or intensive outpatient program in the past when my depression was especially bad (impacting by ability to work, declining hygiene, etc.) but ultimately I never went. My parents are now suggesting that I really consider going as they don't see any improvement and if anything see my mental health declining. It's true that I'm just tired of dealing with depression. I live alone, work from home, have no social life. I struggle to get through each day and struggle to sleep. really I feel like I'm just surviving each day just do it again the next day.

I've started looking into inpatient and intensive outpatient options, but it would be great to hear experiences from anyone that has been in one of these types of programs. The thought is that being in a place where I can get daily help and focus on mental health may allow me to experience real progress.   
  
I also need to consider that going to one of these types of programs will likely be expensive and impact my job, so I don't want to do this if the results aren't much better than what I'm getting through working with a psychiatrist and therapist.|

Can anyone share their experience?

1mcuf5n,Writing to Stay Alive,"Between wounds and the hope of healing : writing to stay alive.

I cry form within, my troubles will drown. But they've learned how to swim. I fall asleep with a heavy heart, dreaming of forgetting the pain. But each morning, misery leaps at my face and sinks in its sharp claws. My features, now distorted, force me to wear a mask to hide the fatigue and the ugliness. In secret, tears finally rise and irrigate my thin, sensitive skin. A masquerade, that’s what my life has become. Condemned by the shame of appearing vulnerable, I flee from myself until I forget who I  really am.

So I write to search through myself. In the depths of the cosmos, I scan the horizon for the abyss. This dark side, this black hole that devours every trace of vitality without pity. I keep my distance, afraid it will consume what remains : my writing. In the midst of chaos, I try to shape some order, and in these paragraphs, find meaning. Ink replaces tears, words become blades. Each sentence grazes my heart. A period and several stitches to stop the bleeding. There’s too much blood, I feel less and less alive.

A fading vitality sparks a war where the battlefield is my own heart. My body becomes the graveyard of my emotions and the coffin of my soul. I carry my tombstone on my back : the weight of an existence where the heart no longer knows how to love.

The hour is dark. The biggest star has collapsed. It is not a supernova. Turn off the light, they serve no purpose. Turn off the spotlight, the masquerade is over. I can remove the mask and reveal myself. Bring me some paper and a pen. The stars still fascinate me, however black holes intrigue me.",1753841272.0,2025-07-30 02:07:52+00:00,2,3,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcuf5n/writing_to_stay_alive/

I don't know, don't bother reading, I just wanted to vent.","He has always had that behavior But it wasn't until the second year together that he met a woman who worked in the cafeteria at his work, he fell in love with her and they had a relationship for a year I guess until I discovered it and the woman went to his ranch to live. He wanted to do things well, forgive him (typically stupid) just at that time he was liquidated at his job and of those 120 thousand pesos to me as his wife who was with him from scratch and obviously we lived together and everything only He gave 500 pesos and why did I ask him for a loan if not nothing, because he became very lazy, he drank too much and took drugs and I was still there, I barely saw him and when I saw him he hit me and treated me horrible...
Well I got pregnant!🤦🏻‍♀️ 
He continued in the same way, he started to say that the baby was not his, he continued to hit me despite being pregnant several times, I left home, he looked for me, and he came back as an idiot, apart from the fact that the house where we lived, we moved it together, belonged to the two of us, and whenever I left, it was with my family, and he struggled a lot. For me, when he hit me and took drugs, I spent the entire pregnancy crying, he didn't help me at all, and I cleaned and carried heavy loads. In short, to this day we are still together around the house because of the baby and why with his condition, I can't go to work and have someone take care of him. He doesn't want to do it. The truth is I'm tired I feel so alone My life hurts so much If it wasn't for my baby I would have already committed suicide I know that the 2 older ones will go with their dad and they would be fine But the youngest one has a difficult life from now on, I really don't want to go back to the depression I had before the baby He cut my arms and legs I even took pills It took up to 3 days without eating I always walk with my swollen eyes I'm always crying I'm really tired I don't know how I can love someone who has treated me so badly He humiliates me He hits me He insults me, he treats me so badly, I'm trapped, I don't know what to do, where to go, I want to die 😭😭😭

1mctint,I feel like my life has no purpose or direction,"I am a mess. I am a 33-year-old female who lives at home with family. I also earn $13 an hour working at a tech support call center full time, and I HATE it. I am dissatisfied with my job, as well as my life itself. Oh, I also have high-functioning Autism, as well as depression, anxiety, and OCD, if that helps. I don’t drive (I have never gotten a learner’s permit, even). 

I can’t seem to find what makes me tick. I do know that I have writing as a strength, and I have been told by a family member that my writing is good. I also know that I am organized. 

My mom just disparaged me about my “sitting on my ass and doing nothing while I am not working.” Why would I want to be productive ALL THE TIME while I am not at work? She seems to think that always working, working, working is the solution to life’s problems. My late grandmother (her mother) once said that my mother has “nervous energy.” 

I often imagine what my life would be like if I had just been more assertive with how I could make something of myself, starting in high school. I think the main reason why I had less freedom in choosing my classes back then was because I was in special education. I am so angry at myself because I was in special education back then (because of my autism). I probably would have taken the AP classes I wanted to take (as well as other high-level classes), and I would have double majored in computer science and Chinese. I would have a high-paying tech career, have the technical and creative hobbies I would want, and I would volunteer often, too. 

But, here I am. I know it is all my fault that I don’t have the life I want, but I am still unhappy. Since I am 33 years old, I feel like I am too old to start from scratch. 

I am going back to school starting early next year. I already have an associate’s degree in a foreign language, and I am going back for my bachelor’s then. 

I just started this rude awakening. I’m 33 (like I previously stated), and I feel like that, for most of my life, I have been in a slumber. That just changed. I want a life of freedom. A life where I could live on my own terms.

1mcs72x,Am I Just Less Than?,"I don't know where else to put these thoughts. I've been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety and recently with CPTSD from childhood emotional abuse and my time trying to teach which ended with a mental breakdown and failure.

I (35m) have a wife (35f) and a son (5m). I'm not sure I'm supposed to feel this way and I think sometimes I'm just whining. I have a house and food to eat, a job. It feels like I'm supposed to be living the dream.

I've been in therapy since 2013. I've always figured there was something wrong with me inherently. I never had a real girlfriend or friends I felt like I connected with. I met my wife in college and for a while i felt like that was behind me.

But recently I left my job teaching because I couldn't take it anymore. The lack of support or understanding from any direction. My peers and bosses never seemed to get it. The kids were amazing. I always felt like a failure trying to help them. I worked in some tough areas,  homeless kids, kids in gangs, some students got shot. I left that to focus on my family because I owed them that and I was freaking out at home.

Since I've done that change I have a new job mostly in an office. People like what I do. But it feels empty. 

My wife hasn't looked at me since we became pregnant. She's dealing with a lot, I don't really blame her. She's working on herself physically. Mentally she's always been more on the dominant side of our relationship. She earns much more money than I do. She controls our finances and how we operate. I seem to just clean the house and the dishes. She's a good mother.

She's going to be gone again for weeks at a time. She travels for work. Achieved an executive role at an early age. I always support her work but it's hurting me that she's gone again. She travels a lot.

I just feel alone. She's the only woman who ever gave me the time of day and she's barely in my life after 8 years of marriage.

I've told her I feel. We've had multiple serious talks. She says she's trying a lot. I believe her but it breaks my heart to live like this sometimes. I feel like no one has ever actually loved me. She always told me people just marry who they're dating when they're 25. Maybe she's right and I was just who was there. Maybe I never found someone who actually cared about me.

But she has been supportive. She helped me get therapy. She's always tried to help me. But she doesn't love me like a husband.

I just don't know what's next. I speak to a therapist. I have a psychiatrist. I take 150mg of venlafaxine daily and trazadone to sleep and weed so often it just doesn't work anymore. I stopped weed a few weeks ago.

I feel like it's all been worthless and like I've just been on the sidelines my entire life and I don't know what to do.

I used to think about just letting the car drift into traffic on my way to work. I don't usually anymore but I still have ideations. I don't own a gun. I do t want to die. But I do t know what else there is for living except to be there for my son.

1mcs21o,I will always be autistic and I cannot cope with it,"I think deep down I always thought I could overcome my autism. I was intelligent enough, mature enough, empathetic enough, in tune with my emotions “enough”. Talking to more people has me realizing that truly, it is hopeless. I am so far behind everyone else it’s almost funny that I ever thought I had a chance to be a likable, outgoing person. I’m not smart, funny, empathetic or verbally fluent. I’m also not attractive or confident. It’s very possible I will never be any of those things at all. 

My awkwardness has barely improved with practice, and even worse is that I’m genuinely not curious at all about other people. It’s hard enough for me to imagine someone being interested in what I think that I usually don’t even try to converse with people who don’t show immediate interest. I’m left with people who pursue me, who either have no other options because everyone else rejected them, relate to me because of our mutual emotional stuntedness(awesome), or weird, transient status seekers. Usually there’s a reason they’re talking to me and not someone else. But honestly, I’m usually happy anyone is talking to me at all. I thought, maybe if I read more books, or watched more comedy, or degraded myself in “therapy” I would finally feel normal, and likable. No, I was just born like this, unchanging and repellant. I don’t know why I haven’t already killed myself.

i suffer from unexplained fatigue and physical pain and memory problems despite all my blood tests are normal ,the more i feel pain the more i feel tired and start to be forgetful.

i have done tests  (CBC), CRP, ESR ,thyroid ,diabetes all seem normal except vitamin d which iam very deficient at, taking vitamin d3 10,000 daily for one month didn't help.

i also have anxiety and depression been taking sertraline for a while it works for depression and anxiety,but my fatigue still exists i dont have CFS because it needs PEM to be diagnosed.

should i suspect that depression is the cause of my chronic fatigue giving the fact that i have been taking antidepressants for long and dont notice any improvements except some days after starting the medication.

TW: suicidal thoughts & ideation

We were arguing about my sister. She said I'm not allowed to cut in her parenting. I said to my mom that she often ingores our problems until they blow up in her face. She said to give her examples. So I did.

I remember how I first started having suicidal thoughts for months. I didn't know what to do and was so tired. We were getting ready for school. I took a kitchen knife and put it to my throat. I told her I want to kill myself. I told her I wanted to die.

She talked me out of it. She took the knife. She made me stay home and took my sister to school. She stayed home from work. I remember I read a book (the candy shop war by brandon mull). She came back and told me ""your sister asked me why you wanted to cut yourself"". I told her I feel like a burden to her, like some trash that got stuck to her and is just weighing her down (I remember using the word velcro).

She made me go to work with her for a few days. I found her old school notebook and was looking through it cause I liked the colors. I was sitting at her work drawing anime girls. But she didn't do anything, didn't take me to therapy, didn't ask anyone for help.

She made me go to confession. Said those thoughts were a sin. I remember the priest, can't remember which tho. He told me about his car accident and how grateful to god he is for life, and i should be too. I remember feeling guilty and like I was gonna go to hell.

Mom claims she doesn't remember this and it didn't happen. She started grilling me for details, and I got anxious, cause I couldn't remember which grade I was in, which job she took me to, which priest I talked to. She said she can't understand my point cause she doesn't remember this.

Then I would talk about suicide all the time after that. I texted my mom a poem about suicide and she came to my school cause she was worried I would do something to myself. I asked a friend ""what do you think is better - suicide or murder?"", she told her parents, who told my mom. She knew. She knew. She knew and neglected this.

Am I making it up? am I lying? I don't remember all the details, am I a bad person for talking about it and mixing stuff up? She was the one who asked me for examples. I am just so confused and don't know what to think. Am I a liar? Im so scared that I'm lying. I have been holding onto this and all the unimportant details are clear in my head, cause I was mentally ill and using escapism, like books and drawing, to deal with it. And she neglected me and my health, just like she is neglecting my sister's health. Which is why I butt in to protect my sister.

I'm so scared that this memory is somehing I made up, cause she denies it happening. Please somebody help, I don't have therapy for another week.",1753831215.0,2025-07-29 23:20:15+00:00,1,0,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcqta6/she_claims_this_traumatic_memory_didnt_happen/
1mcqqzs,"You’re still my husband, and I’m still your wife.","You hide the way you’re struggling because it’s easier to pretend everything’s fine than to show how broken you feel inside.

When panic hits, you shut down completely, no one knows how much you suffer alone, how you try to hold yourself together while the pressure from everyone around you crushes you.

You’re exhausted from fighting battles that no one sees, and I’ve been there, knowing all the pain you bury deep.

I know the way your people push when you’re at your weakest, not seeing how much it hurts ,telling you what to do, pulling you in every direction until you feel like you’re breaking apart just trying to please them.

I never wanted anything from you but to quiet that noise. To be the one place you could breathe without feeling like the world wanted a piece of you.

I know what it cost you to walk away, even if you pretend you’re fine now. I know you tell yourself, that you made the right choice, but I also know you how you force yourself to believe what others need you to believe, even when your heart says otherwise.

You once told me there was no reason to leave, and deep down, I know you still feel that. Don’t You?

People can push, they can scare, they can manipulate… but they can’t erase the truth. I loved your heart when no one else cared enough to understand it, and I carried every part of you, even the parts you thought were unlovable.

1mcqo6u,Some rant about my life,"Recently, I’ve found me a nice amount of friends. Which seems a lot more normal than it is for others but for me it isn’t because I’ve spent an entire year being basically a social outcast and friendless. Which caused me to have social anxiety and depression. And no I’m not talking about some “oh my god I only have like 2 friends I have no friends!!” I literally had 0 people to talk to other than my family. Anyways, in the last year I’ve moved schools and I’ve met new people. The new people introduced me to more new people and blah blah u get it, with medicine and socialising with people overtime im basically healed from my social anxiety kinda. But my depression isn’t gone. I have suicidal thoughts daily and although I won’t go and kill myself I really do think about it like DEEP. and ill always tell myself when I think about killing myself, “I know my mental health isn’t as bad as it was 2 years ago” but I also feel so goddamn empty at the same time. It just still feels like I have no one to live for and nobody would really care if I just went ahead and killed myself. Another reason I wanna kill myself is because I just feel so goddamn ugly, like I’ll always ask people about my appearance to ensure myself I don’t look ugly even though people tell me I’m not ugly I just still feel so ugly and pathetic for even asking people about my appearance.

I'm not good at anything, and I don’t have the strength to do anything. I’ve never been in a relationship and don’t have any friends. I just wish someone needed me. I haven’t had a hug in such a long time. It would be nice if I could hug someone. I just feel empty. My life is lonely and monotonous, and I can barely manage the simplest tasks anymore. I’ve tried for so long to be kind, to make others happy, and most of the time I’ve neglected my own needs whenever I was asked to. But no one wants anything to do with me. I’ve had suicidal thoughts since my childhood, and I’ve made a few attempts. I haven’t been able to cry in ages – not when family members died, not when I was insulted or betrayed. I just want to feel something, anything.

1mcorg2,"Being in a constant state of depression for months, now I've lost hope","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Lately I've been having this feeling that my depression is a lost cause. I've heard that counselling and regular exercising would help alleviate such conditions and I took it to heart: doing counseling twice a month for the past year and I've been exercising pretty regularly. Counseling did help me identify and fix short term temporal issues that did improve some aspects of my problems but I feel like something isn't still going right and I'm sort of still on the decline.

Over the past two months I have had two extremely acute depressive episodes to the point I didn't eat or sleep well for days. Even today as I was on my regular cycling run I felt extremely down and desolate. I'm extremely afraid that even after doing the right things I'm still not about to recover, and for some days I feel like my the deterioration has only been slowed but never halted. 

I grew up in a household where mental health isn't a thing. Having pretty non understanding parents doesn't really help, especially when they tell you things like ""spend more time with us"" or ""why should you even have depression"" when I was younger. I'm covertly seeking help right now, so they don't even know about all this.

1mcof74,I don't want to keep going.,"I've had depression my whole life, and my living situation has also not been very depression-friendly. I've been on and off of medication for years, being discharged and admitted back again constantly.
The place where I live isn't in the best condition and the hood in itself is dangerous and depressing. I have been unemployed for years and have been applying but not being called from anywhere, so my chances of moving are slim. I grew up very lonely, only child/niece/grand daughter, and there were never other kids around. I was bullied and harassed, and went through s*xual abuse twice. 
My life changed last year when I met the love of my life. He's from Germany, and I'm from Costa Rica, but our connection was instant and we clicked in a way that was perfect. I went to visit him earlier this year and my time with him was magical... but he broke up with me earlier this month because he is also very depressed and in no condition to sustain a relationship. 
That relationship was the light of my life.
Now I feel lonely, I see no light, meds only help me sleep but I see no improvement, life looks gray, meaningless. I see no future.
With him, I imagined a life with someone who finally loved me just as much as I loved him, and family, a small house in a place that isn't life threatening...
But now I have nothing, not even love.
I miss him. I don't want to give my heart to anyone else ever.
Memories of the times we shared haunt me daily.
The environment around me makes me wanna crawl in my couch and never open an eye again.
I go to therapy, I take my meds, I pet my cat.
But every day I sink a little lower, and the ache in my chest is deeper.
I don't want this life anymore.
People tell me, love yourself! Be your happiness!! Happiness starts within!!!

i have an amazing boyfriend and two cats that i love dearly, and i live with them in a cheap and honestly poor quality apartment. im on my third job in two years, on and off of employment. i cant seem to stay employed very long before needing to take a mental break, which is beyond exhausting, but also has been affecting me financially, which just adds so much more on top of that. having to use a credit card for necessities feels so defeating. Just, everything I do is exhausting. I have been exhausted for years. I get no relief from anything.

My mom complains about a lot of things about me like my apparent ""Lack of effort"" to clean the house, even though I do it, so it's not like I'm lazy. She also hates that I wear a lot of black clothes and always buys more colorful clothing for me. It's not my fault that the clothes I like came in black.

1mcmlxv,Fühle mich oft unsicher in Freundschaften – bin ich allein damit?,"
Hallo zusammen,
ich bin 24 (w) und hab seit einiger Zeit immer wieder das Gefühl, dass ich Freundschaften ""verlieren"" könnte, wenn ich mich nicht aktiv melde. Oft denke ich: Wenn ich niemandem schreibe, schreibt auch keiner mir. Das macht mich ziemlich unsicher und ich zweifle dann an mir selbst und an der Beziehung zu den Leuten, auch wenn es eigentlich gute Freund*innen aus der Uni oder dem Alltag sind.

Ich merke auch, dass ich sehr auf Bestätigung von anderen angewiesen bin – sei es durch eine Nachricht, ein Treffen oder einfach nur, dass jemand zeigt, dass er oder sie an mich denkt. Wenn das ausbleibt, fühlt es sich schnell so an, als sei ich jemandem egal. Gleichzeitig weiß ich aber auch, dass andere ja auch ein Leben haben und man nicht immer ständig Kontakt haben muss.

Kennt das jemand von euch? Wie geht ihr mit diesem Bedürfnis nach Bestätigung und der Angst, vergessen oder ""fallen gelassen"" zu werden, um?

Würde mich freuen, eure Gedanken zu hören.",1753820990.0,2025-07-29 20:29:50+00:00,1,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcmlxv/fühle_mich_oft_unsicher_in_freundschaften_bin_ich/

I lay in bed doom scrolling or sleeping, i don’t remember the last time I showered properly or brushed my teeth or ate a healthy meal or gone out unless my sister is pulling me along to do errands. My closest friends are just going out without me now and i don’t care anymore. I feel sad at first and then remember i probably stink, I don’t want to get out of my comfortable clothes, who wants to talk in person anyway and I have no energy to walk anymore so i stay at home. ai started cancelling on everything after i spent weeks pleading with people to let me go out with them but they couldn’t or wouldn’t. I don’t care. I got sad and now i don’t care. I want to talk to my friends but i’ve been prioritizing other people instead of myself and my issues which is making me feel worse. I just need to be busy with something but i’m not and i can’t, and when my friends have a problem i just talk to them about their issues and help them through it because its getting me be busy but it gotten to the point i get even more depressed because all people do is vent to me now. I feel useless. 

And here comes the fun part: Im trying to talk to them about reaching out to me more and asking how im doing but i feel like I’m begging for attention. I feel wrong. I always reach out after my best friend has an issue because i finally feel like there’s a window for me to talk about it with out getting ignored. I’m not blaming them for anything I’ve gotten myself slip this far, honestly i’ve been struggling mentally since april but physically since June. Doesn’t help that i’m autistic too and life just gets so overwhelming when i leave my bed and im forced to talk to people that i don’t want to. I make sure to cut all conversations short and if they keep being longer i just leave them on read. So im asking pleading for my friends to check up on me. Even once every 2 weeks, force me to go out because I know if im being forced im gonna have to wash my rats nest hair and finally do my laundry. But instead they never include me, and now i dont want to be included. I think this is the lowest it’s ever been. I feel pathetic. I already sent the message earlier today as they went to hang out with each other again and i’m gonna talk to them later tonight but i feel wimpy and bad now so now im scared and don’t want to. Am i asking for attention? It feels like i am. I just want people to ask me if im okay when im not okay. I do that constantly why can’t they.

1mclxwj,"The girl I had situationship with is depressed, has amnesia. don’t know what to do next","So we were very close for about 3 months, and at the beginning of our talking, we confessed we really did like each other, but she told me she needs time to heal from her past relationship plus know each other better. 
She is a super kind soul, really, I don’t think I have ever met or seen such kind, caring, and righteous person.

After 2,5 months of the talking, she was ill for a week, had low mood. After she got kinda well, she out of nowhere for me told me that she thinks we should stay friends. Obviously, I asked her why, but she kept saying “you deserve better”, “I don’t have a future”, “I don’t want you to go down with me”. I could not really understand all of this because it seemed like there isn’t any reason for this. I had not met people with depression before this happened, I guess that’s why I could not apprehend anything. But I just had to accept it and move on. 

Apparently she had some neurological illness, and at exactly that time it worsened, and so did her depression I think. We went back to our hometowns, have not talked (since we had a beef, but it doesn’t matter that much now) until yesterday. She texted me. And I know it might sound crazy, but apparently her illness got worse, she fainted and hit her head. She got amnesia, and she texted me to apologise cause she felt she did something horrible that hurt me, but she couldn’t recall what exactly. I told her, she recalled most of it and sincerely apologised. And I forgave her. 

Now the situation is that she still thinks she cannot have a future, does not have interest in future, and doesn’t wanna live. I want to help her. She apparently went to many therapists, but no one actually helped, so I don’t know what to do. She says she feels like that for a very long time, 10 years I think. 

I don’t know if her depression will be cured, so I don’t know if I can want to be in a relationship with her (if she reconsiders). I am afraid that would be a big burden to be with someone with depression, but I think I don’t know if that is even possible to be in a relationship like that happily. 

It would be great if you can share what it is like to have such depression, how to deal with it, and how should I perceive this. I am very worried about her.

Broooo it would be so cool to just die and end this guilt. This feeling that me living it just a burden omg the world would be better off without me. Omg it’s so true I feel it in my soul

I don’t deserve to say I’m depressed or have mental illness. ADHD? OCD? CPTSD? MDD? GAD? Sure I may have to been told I have them and diagnosed with them, but maybe I don’t deserve to say that. Maybe I am just truly a disgusting soul that needs to fucking end. I will never change because im a hedonistic bastard

I am true scum. I need to die for the sake of the people around me and myself at this point. I’m tired of the mental illnesses. It’s too many of them and they hurt legitimately every fucking day for over 10 years and nobody cares. Nobody loves or cares about me. Because I deserve it. It’s all my fault.

But nah man I’m too scared of hell. And if there is no afterlife then a black screen for eternity is also scary as fuck too so there really is no winning here

1mclnpy,Trying to express the benefits of working 1st shift when it comes to depression,"I know what it is to be stuck in the cycle, barely able to even maintain proper care of yourself. 

My way of coping , or helping myself in any way I could..was to force myself into situations that I feel would be beneficial.  Even if I have to fight the dark draw to lay there through my alarms. 

I've worked 2nd and third shift jobs my whole life. A night owl through and through . It required the least amount of interaction and effort,  and when I was promoted,  I often crumbled under the anxiety caused by depression.  The feeling of worthlessness. 

But I got a new job, 1st shift, outdoors. The effects were...immediate. 

In a visual sense, colors were brighter. My body adjusted to a sleep schedule that I found super beneficial to me as a human.  And physically. 

That physical boost in turn gave me a mental one. I lost weight that I had gained sitting there in my head trying to escape from what felt like crushing weights of responsibility.  

There is NO one size fits all to depression. There's not. Im not ln a pedestal telling you what will fix you. 

But friends, it's so easy to forget (in this shitty, money driven world) that we are not nocturnal creatures. That we are designed to wake with the sun. I blew it off until I was forced to live this way.  


Even something as simple as waking up to the smell of a houseplant does wonders for your mental health. 

Im not breathing air yet, but I can damn sure see the surface. If this helps anyone experience even slight relief from being painfully stuck in the loop , then im glad it did. 

Get some sun , yall. Keep breathing.

1mckbg7,Am I gonna find my way out of depression?,"So, I have been facing certain issues from the past three years. During my initial days, I used to feel that I am stuck in a loop where I am happy for 10 days and sad for 20 but it ended real quick and then I went on a work trip to Egypt with a friend of mine. The trip was for a good 40 days but I had to come back home in a week coz I started having major panic attacks and it was my first time. After coming home, I tried therapy but somehow it didn’t go well and I ended up moving above that trip without working out on my issues. Basically my escapism game was on point and after certain period, I entered into a state of numbness. Whenever anybody asked me “how am I doing?”, I had no answers. I wasn’t able to express myself like the way I used to. Things got worse when I started hating on the things I used to love, getting out of my bed became a problem, sleeping more than 11 hours and always being in the numb state. I decided to go to a 10 day vipassana course so that I can sit with myself and figure out what has been going on but the moment i entered into the centre, Egypt happened all over again. I started having panic attacks and this time i didn’t wait for my condition to get worse I asked them to let me go home. The moment i came home I had a word with another psychologist and booked an appointment. But I feel that I am stuck in this loop forever. It’s been so long that I have truly felt myself.

1mck67f,Mom passed away and I’m lost in life,"Hi everyone, as the title says, my mom recently passed away in the beginning of April. She had been dealing with heart problems for about two years until it just got to be too much for her body to handle. Since her passing I’ve felt to be completely lost in my life and this world. I’m only 21 but she was my everything, no matter what situation we where going through or how her health was, she always made sure that I didn’t have to worry and it didn’t matter how small or large the issue was. I could call her at anytime of the day, stressed out about something and by the end of the call, she would always make me feel like everything would be okay. Now that she’s gone, it feels like nothing will ever be okay. Every big event that could possibly happen in my life, birthdays, holidays, getting married, having kids, I just know I’ll be thinking of my mom and wishing she was also here to experience those moments. When I was sitting in hospice with her, waiting for the inevitable, it felt like the world had stopped and ever since her passing it feels like my world is still stuck while everyone else’s picked up again. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I shut my eyes at the end of the night I think about my mom and I know that won’t ever end. I’d do anything just to talk to her one more time. Thankfully I have my sister and father to talk too but the grief sometimes is too hard to deal with, even with support. I’m sorry if this post was all over the place, I’ve never actually posted in a community before but I just needed my words to be heard/read because it’s so hard to keep myself together most days.

1mck2aw,Working a 9-5 is making me depressed…,"Ever since I graduated college 4-5 years ago I’ve been jumping from job to job . Every job was depressing to me and something not looking forward to

I was a case manager, teacher assistant, warehouse , and Macys. None of these jobs really excite me …(well Macys was fun as I was able to dress up everyday)…so I think I’m into creative endeavors 

I don’t understand why as human beings we have to suffer and work these mundane jobs until we die…it’s so depressing.

I feel I am different and would like to take an unconventional approach to life…

I thought about other career paths (creative/artistic ones) such as social media content creator, model, something in beauty industry (makeup artist, tattoo artist, nail tech) business owner, or even a professional nomad 😅….traveling in RV and off grid somewhere. I just want to be free….o feel trapped 

….but I keep thinking these jobs are not realistic , probably won’t pay much, don’t knowing how it would do in near future, I’m 25k debt from bachelors in speech therapy and I’ve never tried any of them 😂😅….so I don’t know if I’ll hate these paths to….as unfortunately work is work 🤷🏽‍♀️

I decided I was feeling better so came off them slowly. I was fine for a while and now I can feel the depression (and with it some social anxiety) coming back. Nowhere near as bad as before - I’m not bed-bound, I can get up and go to the gym, see friends, go to work etc. But I feel irritable and generally down and it’s affecting the people around me. I feel going back on antidepressants would help, though I was really hoping to manage without them. One other aspect putting me off is wanting to try for kids in future and not wanting to be on medication.

1) Should I keep trying to manage my mental health issues without medication? Any tips?

1mcgs6k,Scared to start new med combo - Is this safe? (Fluoxetine + Clomipramine),"Hey everyone, 23M here with depression and focus issues. My doctor just added a new med to my fluoxetine (Prodep 20mg morning) and I'm nervous:  
 
 **New Prescription:**  
  - Clomipramine 25mg at night  

 **Why I'm worried:**  
  - Read these two drugs together can cause ""serotonin syndrome"" (dangerous reaction)  
   - Saw FDA warnings about heart rhythm problems  
   - Already feel ""heavy headed"" from fluoxetine  
 
**My questions:**  
  1. Is this combo *ever* safe without special testing first? (Like heart tests?)  
  2. Should I push for a different med? (Heard aripiprazole might be safer)  
  3. If I try it, what danger signs mean ""go to ER immediately""? ",1753808039.0,2025-07-29 16:53:59+00:00,1,0,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcgs6k/scared_to_start_new_med_combo_is_this_safe/

1mcf75w,Am I Suffering from depression ?,"Today I realized I might be going through depression. For the past 7-8 months, I was depressed about a love interest lost. Then suddenly it shifted from that to an easy life which I left in past. Which was a myth-
There
1. I used to constantly work from 10-8pm, with very little break
2. Used to crib
3. Had job security

Now given my current role, for the past 7 months-
1. I’ve barely worked maybe 3 hours a day
2. Some days just didn’t work
3. Imagining the other life was good 

Then suddenly I frantically started thinking of ways to go back to previous life , imagining every scenario where I could have gone back. Fighting with everyone why they didn’t tell me. Imagining a perfect life I left behind. 
The thoughts took a dark turn where I imagined I might end it all and be done with it , my life is finished anyway. 
Then I started researching ways to go, planning date. But each method had a risk, what if you don’t go, you’ll damage your brain or become dependent, so it scared me. 
Money wise , even if I would have stayed in past job , I would have been earning same or less only. 
Suddenly I prayed to God for a sign and I talked with a potential love interest. She was so upbeat about her life and didn’t care about job title and was enjoying her life. Her attitude sparked something in me. It gave me hope.
And suddenly I realized , I might be depressed. that the easy life I’m looking doesn’t exist. Pretty sure if I had stayed back then I would be thinking the same only or worse. 
I’m just scared of working and putting in effort and expect an easy life , which I know doesn’t exist. 
I remember last year , I was pretty optimistic , putting in hours at work , getting appreaciation and losing a love interest caused me to go down this rabbit hole. 
Any advice someone can give me would be helpful. After the conversation with a potential new love interest , sparked that drive in me a little. I want to live this life to the fullest, grow and improve and live to the end of my natural life happily and not shy away from hardwork and beat the illusion of easy life.

1mcf3ew,Hard Mode ++,"Life has always be hard. I mean, abuse, going deaf at age of 6, SA by a female tutor, dropping out of High school cuz I couldn't understand whatever they taught. Working in factories even though I've got asthma. 

So yeah, life has been hard. But there were some silver linings. Like finding a job that wasn't factory and a lover. 

Sadly both things are the very reason why I'm tired to the bone. 

With love, we brokeup after 7 years, cuz her parents didn't like me, which is valid considering I don't like me either. Then with work, I work as a content writer, getting a good job before the AI thing was hard, now it's downright impossible. 

I ask, I show my work and it's always a no, because I'm goddamn deaf. A liability. If I share my work with a friend and ask them to apply. They get the job. Of course the said friend doesn't know me after that, only does when they need something. 

I write over 120k words a month and make barely $260. Which obviously isn't enough. 

All I wanted and still want was to live happily, I'd planned to take mum for a holiday and take my first holiday in 6 years next year, now I'm wondering if I'll be able to do it. 

I'm tired. I'm trying to learn things like SEO or PPC, but they need hands on experience, which means I have to apply for such jobs. Sadly nobody accepts. And since I'm 27, I don't have enough time to learn better skills like web development cuz there's always younger talent available.

Why am I telling y'all all this? I don't know. I shouldn't. All my efforts to mend life are going to vain, and that makes me scared of what's ahead.

1mce85d,Some words to my dad. I somehow finally can talk through it,"For depressants, just read my last paragraph.

""Dad, don’t ask why you have had insomnia for decades while your life, when awake, is already a nightmare? Maybe, the time when you try to sleep, is the peaceful part of your life, then you have to get up, continue to live the endless nightmare?""

Just had a talk to my dad when I realized, the biggest bully of my life is actually him. Over the time of my life, I realized I have come to accept all the words like 'You have a fking shit eyesight you will certainly be blind', 'You will have a hunchback for the rest of your life'... I am no longer afraid of whips, we got rid of them, and even if they were still here, I'm strong enough to fight back. I tried to forget the memories and learnt to obey. But now I still remember. Finally could talk to him that I'm not afraid that anything shit will happen with my life anymore, that I can happily die now, since it will both affect negatively on both him and me. I'm free from my thoughts now, never want to leave this world again. And I love you dad, no hate on you. I'm grateful for what you've done to me. All of them.

And fk listen you depressants, bc I just searched for this subreddit and already feeling bad reading all these posts. You are angry of someone?  
You just want to fking kill them? Or kind enough, just want them to fk off this world forever?  
DON'T SUICIDE  
YOU TORTURE YOURSELF AND THEY RECEIVE NONE  
IF YOU SUICIDE YOU LOSE IT ALL  
CONTINUE TO LIVE, LIVE FOR YOURSELF, IMPROVE YOUR OWN CONDITION  
and until you have the capability to basically do whatever you want, you are superior to them  
have a good talk (or maybe more, depends on you) then to all of your enemies  
craft your words, as sharp as possible, just like what they did to you  
you see them collapse, slowly, make them feel everything you have been through  
you have my cheer, you got this  
fuck them all

My brain wants to study and enjoy life, but my body and mind are just too tired. I try to push myself, like studying for 5 hours today, but then I just crash. This makes me feel like a failure, especially when I remember a time I could study for 18 hours easily.
It's a constant, deep tiredness, and I think it might be from things like depression, anxiety, burnout, or constantly doubting myself.

It's even making me act grumpy with people I care about.

Also it seems like nothing in my life is going right and I cry all the time. Everytime I think something is going well, something happens to pull me back to reality. 
My vehicle isn't in the best shape, but it's not in my budget for another. My phone works but sometimes barely. 

I feel like I annoy everyone in my life so I usually just don't talk about my problems. 
I have found an amazing man and I want the world with him, and I think he would do his best to give it to me, yet I know soon he too will slip away.

I taught ethnic students at my full potential.

Recently, I quited that job and now serving as a pdf ( revolutionary forces against junta). It's been like 6 months I'm here. But the problem is I'm working under safe environment which is like a  military ministry . I worked in non-war works like media and shits since I'm educated .

But as you know .. Revolution is long and hard I know. I feel ashamed of working under safe environment . I just want to fight in frontline and die (or survive whatever). I imagine of living like hemmingway , doing everything I want .

This group is about depression , I know. But I dun think that's even the issue of me. Innocent people getting bombed everyday , junta getting tiny stronger under chinese support and shits.

I'm just now under a mental condition  that I want to forget every fucking values , standards , political correction and things . I just want to fight like a man and die or alive . What do you think of that. 

( When saying fight like a man , I dun mean it's like patriarchy. Just that I want to fight like a soilder in my life time and die)

I dun believe in next life . We all die and we will be someone else memory.",1753800391.0,2025-07-29 14:46:31+00:00,2,2,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcddze/idk_just_read_guys/
1mcd2lr,It is normal to feel like this? Do I need to reach out?,"To preface, I've already spoken with my doctor about anxiety and depression, for which I was given resources and a temporary group on Mindfulness, which gave me some coping mechanisms, but the effectiveness for me seems to have plateaued.

For the past 2 years or so, especially ramping up over the past year, I've felt it incredibly difficult to feel anything. Most of the time.

I feel so disconnected from myself. I struggle to take care of my needs. I feel a complete apathy to my own wellbeing, I think at least partially because I find it hard to remind myself that I'm a person at all.

Everyone around me looks so vibrant. I feel lucid as an observer, but I find myself physically forgetting that I'm a person too.

My own name feels hollow. I find it practically impossible to imagine my future self. My memories of my past feel like I'm remembering a different person.

I have no will or drive to do things any more. I can't focus even on video games, movies, reading. The joy and passion that I used to have just feels absent.

Externally I do my best to stay optimistic, helpful, and seem functional. But I feel like it's nothing more than an act. A coping mechanism to keep myself alive.

Especially with the way the world is going, trans rights taking blows, freedom of information restricting. It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller. Like the world itself is starting to choke at my neck, and I can't breathe any more.

I know burnout and at least some levels of depression are ""common"" especially with younger generations. But I'm really fighting with the idea of maybe reaching out to try and get some help. But I'm not sure how much of this is in my head, and how much might require actual help.

I thought because I got private insurance I’d get a new prescription real fast. But it’s now been 6 weeks, and I’m spiraling. The stress of job hunting, the social isolation from the language barrier (I’m overcoming it, I’m learning fast), and the terror of what will come when my visa ends. I am in absolute terror. I can’t focus, I can barely sleep. Trying to find a doctor here is… hilarious. There really are no good medical systems in the world.

What do I do? I’m not in immediate danger, but I need meds. I need help, and I don’t know what to do.

1mcbqv9,I thought being attractive would make me happy. It doesn’t.,"   I used to be really skinny and kinda ugly in high school. I never really believed I could have a relationship with a girl, and it didn’t really bother me. I was happy, or at least content, playing video games, drinking beer, and delivering pizzas. 

   Fast forward a few years and I guess I had a bit of a glow up. I started working out and eating better, I started wearing more flattering clothes, and my face changed. I’m not sure how to explain it, but when I look at old photos now, my face definitely looks more grown and handsome now. For the first time in my life, I could be considered fairly attractive. I wasn’t aware of this AT ALL. I guess because it’s hard to notice change when it’s so gradual? 

   So I had this coworker. She was a couple years my junior, and she was so so beautiful. I work with a couple older ladies and they all kinda joke that we would be cute together. I would laugh it off always, still maintaining the old idea that no girl would want to be with me. We were kinda flirty though, and so I thought, ‘what the hell,’ and just asked her out one day. She said yes, and I thought she was just being polite. Again, at this point I had no idea that I’m a pretty good looking guy. 

   So we go see a movie and it goes really well; we made out in the theatre and we were laughing and talking and later I dropped her off. For the next few months we text almost nonstop and we see each other at work all the time. We would meet up at night a few times, but other than that, we almost never saw each other outside of work. This was for reasons I don’t really want to get into. 

   Anyway, I learned during our talks that she always thought I was really hot. I want to reiterate that this girl was beautiful. She was really pretty, had an amazing body, she had a bold but cute personality, she was amazing. When she told me she thought I was hot, it completely changed how I saw myself. 

   We were never really dating, but whatever we had ended. I don’t want to get into the details. Afterwards, I felt fine for a while. I had a new confidence in myself. I saw two other girls in the months following that. It actually surprised me how easily I could meet other girls now. The problem was I couldn’t connect with any of them and I didn’t know why. I stopped seeing the girl I was seeing, and I couldn’t really explain to her why I wanted to end it. I just left. 

   And then this sadness entered my life. Overwhelming, crushing sadness. Like nothing I’d ever felt before, ever. At first it was so intense I didn’t know what to do. I would just ball up in my bed and sob because I literally didn’t know what else to do, the feeling was so awful. 

   I thought this feeling was a symptom of grief for losing the first girl, but it’s been so long. And I still feel like this all the time. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. 

   Fast forward a few months, and now I’m here. I haven’t met anyone new, and I’m not trying to. I’m afraid to. I’ve been trying to understand my emotions better, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed I haven’t really been sad. However, I haven’t been happy either, or angry, or anything. I’ve just kind of felt numb. I think maybe I’ve been bottling up my emotions subconsciously, because the other night I bawled my eyes out for no apparent reason. Nothing really bad happened that day, so I don’t know why I felt like that. 

   Anyways, I just thought writing down my thoughts would maybe make me feel better. Realistically I think I need therapy. I’m not sure if I’m depressed, but I’m trying every day to understand myself better. Peace and love be with you all.

1mcbjvv,"I dont know, I just needed to put it somewhere else other than in me.","
No matter how hard I try, all my might and grit arent enough stop be from being here.  Its quiet now all the time- i wake up to nothing and I return home to a half life.

Its all gone, the stitching has unfurled.  This hell is sweet; it exists because of love. 

I hate this place. 

I wish for peace. For  rest and for silence, there was a time I tasted pieces of each- but never a full plate.  

Was i ever real?, was anything?, were you?.  

I see proof; screenshots of messages so I wouldnt forget things loved and wanted; I was once among them.

After so much death to have such little light steal itself away from me?- maybe I am the things ive been told.  I know im not all bad- I just dont have the reminder.

The bed is warm and lonley, the kitchen table has four chairs  only one  is ever used.   I sit i wait and watch the sun through the window.  3 months so far- to me you were lost yesterday; I wonder if you could remember me- would you even choose to?.  Am I  cursed to carry another weight forever?, will i withstand and endure the sand filled winds at the edge of that pit or is it to strong finally. 

My heart splintered, parts vanquished and fetitd  full of rot- it isnt a new fact but the taste is getting to me.  

I've buried, pets friends, parents and now I have to find a way to mourn you in some new way. 
 How can i mourn the loss of light when its hard to rememeber its warmth?. 

You gave me hope, you dashed it in a manner of seconds; one decision- years gone never to return.

I miss you, I love you , my sweet girl. ",1753795963.0,2025-07-29 13:32:43+00:00,2,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcbjvv/i_dont_know_i_just_needed_to_put_it_somewhere/

jag fungerar inte i vårat samhälle......

Jag har ingen vilja alls, att vara en ekorre som arbetar för någon annan.

eget företag heh den branschen är för tävlingsinriktat.... så där lär jag inte klara av det.  
visst det är bättre att försöka än ge upp....

FUCK, vad jag hatar att jag vart född i en fattig familj, som har skulder.  
Klaga hjälper inte.... enda utvägen är att kämpa, kämpa, kämpa.... och hoppas att jag får tur.... att livet kommer vända....

men sanningen är den livsstil, jag vill leva.... dit kommer man inte på att vara en normal människa.....

hur håller folk ens sig motiverade till att vilja va en ekorre åt någon annan? Det kanske inte känns så för dig...  
Men för mig känns det som att jag är en kossa om jag skulle välja att arbeta, i 08-17 världen.

det är också förståeligt att dom som har arbetat hårt, att komma upp till världen där dom kan anställa folk, att dom inte vill ha folk som är gnälliga och orutinerad och att dom inte kommer, ge belöning åt människor som är lata, det förstår ju vem som helst.

Så ja..... vad är utvägen?  
personligen så hoppas jag att, ja hittar någon rik fru som vill ta hand om mig.

1mcani9,I want to kill myself just to be at ease and peace,"Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, why these three elements made their home in me. I have been depressed my whole life, even as a child I couldn't live it perfectly coz of our financial situation and sexual harassment. Back then, I just thought this sexual assault is a game so every time that person asked I would go. Didn't engaged in any other activities, didn't make friends, nothing at all. I know no one going to read this long-long story but I don't know why I wanted to write it here and I have no idea what could that obvious reason be, I just wanna do it. 

 
My first depression episode started when I was giving my final 12th exam but it was not that extreme then, when I got in collage, I made some friends who made my depression worst being soo selfish and always make feel left out and some of other things were there too that made me realize all a man wants is sex, not love not anything and it did hit me so hard. I attempted suicide, but then I saw my parents it made me realize this is not an option I have to be strong and make our life better. Without external help I overcame the depression, I worked hard got a good job bought a house for ourselves - finally we didn't have to live in rented house. We were happy and its been 2 years in our new home. 

But as I think I am cursed I cannot be happy for long, My wedding is scheduled in oct and I have no savings, and what more happened? I lost my job. Everything's falling apart. I cannot enjoy the only thing I will experience once in my life, I have bills to pay, EMIs and more imp wedding. The lay off got me so hard, my depression is triggered again and I am harming myself more than ever now. I am not able to see a future so I just want to be dead or sleep all the time so that I don't have to face the reality. It's been 2 months since my lay off, haven't got even a single offer after applying restlessly day and night. Life is tough, I know they are trails, but I just wanted to be happy at my wedding. Most importantly I can cancel the wedding but what about the home I bought for my family, who will give EMIs, everything's fuckedup.  

Since I am not getting any job, I can still save my house but it requires me dead, just want to know what are some tactics to suicide and make it look natural?

1mc9ynf,Ruined my life.,"Ive only been truly in love with one person since I was 15, I’m 25 now. The only meaning and purpose ive made in life was to love this girl. She was the only person I would’ve married and had a family with.

It’s been over three months since we broke up and I know deeply that I will never love someone again because I’ve never been able to. I try but no one is ever her. 

Prior to this year I had to end a six year relationship because all I ever did was dream about this girl even after not talking to her for six years. 

My life now is dreaming about what could’ve been, her having children with the new guy etc. it’s very rare I don’t wake up from dreaming about her. No matter what I accomplish or do I think about her every morning and night. Nothing matters anymore I just do good things hoping one day something will work out but I know deep down there is no plan B and I’ll be haunted by this relationship for the rest of my life. 

Ultimately she probably did love me and I ruined the best thing that will ever happen to me. I won the lottery and blew it. I’d trade all the money in the world to just to live in a tent with her.

1mc8pg5,Contemplating about Suicide that I was very sure to commit,"For the past two months, I’ve been thinking about ending my life more than ever before. I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, and although I’ve had a few serious attempts in the past, this time feels different.

This time, I’m not acting impulsively. I’ve made a plan. I’ve picked a date. And with each passing day, it feels more like something I’m meant to do. I’ve even researched famous suicides looking for inspiration, trying to make sure nothing can go wrong.

I’m currently in therapy and on antidepressants, even on the maximum dose, but nothing seems to change. Today I told my therapist everything: the method, the plan, and why I feel so certain this time. He asked how he could help, and I told him nothing could this is a final decision, and nothing in this world could change it. I was completely sure until I got home.

Now, I’m torn again. Part of me still believes that my problems are too deep and permanent to ever be solved at least not within my lifetime. I don’t just hate myself. I feel like I was never meant to exist among other people. Like I’m something else entirely. That I don’t belong here, that I never will.

Even if I kept going, nothing would really change. I’ll always feel this way. Suicide doesn’t feel like a choice it feels like my destiny. But then something my therapist said made me pause. It made me feel guilty. I don’t know how to go from here. What would you do?

I don’t know. I can’t elaborate better than this I would like to do but I’m just tired.

A few weeks ago my brother asked my mom to pretty much cut me out of any inheritance (I’m adopted btw) and then compared me to someone who isn’t family. I’ve always considered him my brother and hearing this put me into a full spiral realizing that once my parents pass away I’ll have no family left and that someone I’ve considered family doesn’t even think of me the same. Between the family issues and being conflicted with my relationship that i see no future with I’ve stopped feeling anything. I’m also stressed about school and ending up doing nothing with my life. I have friends however it doesn’t feel like they will really be there like my boyfriend has always been. I know I’m being selfish holding onto him but I just feel so numb and don’t want to do anything.

1mc7omw,I've been so depressed that now I cant even share anything with anyone.,"I've been depressed for the past 5 years and even more so the last three years. This past year I've spent most of my time couped up in my room, procrastinating on everything. Pure nihilism and suicidal ideations. I only go out once or twice a week with one old friend who reaches out. Even then I just pretend. 

Because of this depression I got into religion more to understand things better, with it lots of theology videos and philosophy. Anything to just get me to a new place of thinking.

What happened in turn, (even though I was a lefty) I became agnostic atheist. Now I am even in deeper meaningless-ness. And I can't share this with my family because in thier minds it doesn't need to be that deep. So I just pretend now, it truly is a new kind of aloneness. I am lonely too time to time but it doesnt bother me. 

Im very close to ending it all but what stops me is the pain it will cause my family. But truly if I can't even push myself to do basic things and not be afraid, overwhelmed and flustered what's the point? I could somehow in the past push through it all. But now the responsibility to just live and exist feels too much. 

To get up to shower, to brush my teeth. I did all this in the past because I had to, because external factors like school and work made me do them. But I still felt optimistic about life then. 

Now I wake up and I wish why I hadn't died in my sleep.

Diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression and recently borderline personality disorder.

I have a three year old child, full time single parent. Currently studying online. Live alone in a rented property with my child. They are the only reason I don't end it all right now.

I have no family. Well I have parents and a brother but they are unwell and it is hard to see them as we live far apart. 

Child's father is not involved in her life. DV.

I thought I would have been so much more by now. Happily married, nice house, following my dreams, being successful.... and the reality is I am crying while writing at my computer to strangers, hoping someone somewhere has a nugget of wisdom that will keep me going. If I didn't have my child I promise I would end it all, but I can't leave her, she would end up in someone elses care and no one would love her like I do or give her everything as I so desperately try to.

I am so alone. I have been single for three years. When I was young I always had boyfriends etc. Which when digging deeper, was probably due to childhood trauma.

1mc77fd,How do I get past my greif,"I am an 18m and within the last few weeks I have felt an immense amount of guilt and I have been left feeling stuck in a perpetual state of numbness and confusion. With the help of medical professionals I have been given a Zoloft prescription that I have started taking within the last week. I am disgusted with myself and I want to grow and get past my guilt. I am responsible for the death of my family dog on behalf of my negligence. I regret not being there to care for him. I am sick to my stomach with how careless I was at the time of his passing, I held I’m in my arms when he died, I can’t begin to imagine the way my dog had felt as he passed away. I know that I should learn from my experience and I feel as if I have failed my dog, my family as well as myself. There are a lot more details that I can provide, but currently I’m not in a good position to talk about it fully. My psychiatrist has told me about therapy for PTSD and other traumas but I don’t know about it. What is EMDR therapy? How does it work? How do I grow and learn to forgive myself? I feel stuck in the past event, I feel haunted by him. People in my life keep telling me how it wasn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel responsible. I find myself isolating myself and withdrawing from my family far more than I had done in the past.  I apologize for the writing in this post being all over the place, I am extremly emotional as I write this, reflecting on what has happened. He died on July 9th of this year and at the time of writing this I am still regretful, and I just don’t know how to progress past this point. I can’t stop thinking about him and how I failed him. I’ve been told continuously that I should forgive myself and try to move forward but no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to get past this weight on my shoulders. I’ve been trying to socialize more with my friends to keep myself out of the house and doing more productive things to help cope. I am writing this in hope of finding people who have had a similar experience of feeling overwhelming guilt and I want to know what you’ve done to cope and manage the feelings of numbness, regret, depression, and guilt. Words cannot even begin to describe how I feel. I find myself going through intense waves of guilt and feeling haunted by the loss of my family dog. Knowing that my family still loves me, and knowing that they don’t blame me and forgive me brings me little comfort, I cannot escape my thoughts lately. I want to atleast learn how to manage so I can get into a better mental health state. I can’t stop hearing his barks at night, and I would sob relentlessly but now I find myself being unable to cry and express my feelings. How do I manage grief? Is there any coping mechanisms That you would be willing to share? Do you have a similar experience? I Just need to know that I’m not alone I want to feel alive again, I want to forgive myself. Please tell me of anything that you can share that may help me.",1753782567.0,2025-07-29 09:49:27+00:00,3,0,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc77fd/how_do_i_get_past_my_greif/

There's no teachers/faculties, it's really poor and we can't afford private institutions so well....In that college we have to maintain attendance over 75% even though faculties will be absent more often than students and by faculty I mean guys sitting on examination shell & fee counter.  
I never got that attendance so they never gave me internal marks more than 40/50 it were like 30/50, 31/50, 26/50 and yes below 30, it's internal back for which I need to get least 34 marks out of 100 in externals and well I did not pass Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering in 1st year.  
I got 4 more backs in 2nd year but 3rd and 4th year I focused on progress and got no back although I cleared 2nd year's back.  
now I'm passed out last month, I finished final examination and attended back paper examination for Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering from 1st year and results are out.  
Of course I passed my all 4th year subjects maintaining CGPA over 6 but but but, guess what.

**I FAILED IN BOTH MATHS AND MECHANICAL AGAINNNN!**

Not like I didn't studied dude it's fucking 4th year and I'm poor, I'm stressed for job, I'm busy learning CSE skills for job, I'm busy studying subject I need to and why do I need to pass Basic-Mechanical-Engineering anyway for Software-Developer-Role?

*They gave me like 0.5 or 1 marks on 3-4 page 10 marks answer.*

I can't get degree without it, I'm afraid to tell my parents, I have job pressure already and now I'm depressed.

There's Special Back examination after 3 months but how will I get the money to fill that form?

I got like 26 marks out of 30 where I needed at least 30 to pass the test but they are now laughing at my life wait are they sadist?

Now I'm not sure what to do with my life and thanks for the social media algorithm I'm suddenly getting introduced to those people on the internet who were like get there PhD done when they were 14yrs, those people who solved NASA math for school homework which already making me way too old for my life and I'm getting more and more suicidal thoughts at night.",1753780993.0,2025-07-29 09:23:13+00:00,2,0,depression,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc6ste/im_depressed_and_dont_now_what_to_do/

has no presence.

1mc66aw,I don't understand why I feel this way,"I'm in my 4th year of Law school. I guess it's either the competitiveness, peer pressure or the toxic friend group that I was in from the very beginning that drained me. 

The fact that I'm writing this itself feels unreal to me. It's almost like I don't want to believe that I'm depressed. Or anxious. I get anxious to the point that it affects my speech patterns. My heart races to a point that I can't hear a word anyone's saying and I get nauseous. I'm done with people telling me I need professional help. I know I do. It's just that my parents are conventional minded when it comes to this. 

I don't even feel like going to college. The friend group I was in was weirdly competitive when it came to enrolling in extracurricular activities and they hung out behind my back...like I was shunned...like they didn't wanna be associated with me. And all along I thought I it's becuase I'm weird (Like who wants to associate themselves with a weirdo who's always depressed right?). That's the part that hurt me the most. The fact that I gave up on myself. More than anything else.

(Now I'm in a different friend group where my presence is appreciated and I feel like I'm valued and theirs is all in shambles). 

I don't know why it's hitting me now. My grades have took a huge plunge. I have attendance shortage and what not. 

As they say your environment influences how you behave. I grew up in an environment (My parents are generous and have a helping mentality)  where everyone are givers. My mum I felt like expects getting back atleast 1/10 th of what she gives. My dad is a chill guy tho 😂. As you can see, naturally I inherited their very characteristics. I used to think why they dedicate so much of their energy to people who dgaf about them. (Turns out they're both middle children 😭)

I used to hate their 'giving' mentality. But now...I've become the very thing I hate. And it's taken all my strength to accept the fact that it's not so bad to be a giver. To be like your parents. To not be like your parents. 

To be the side character who gets shuffled to the back of the crowd. To be the one clicks the pictures but never gets clicked. To be alone. To be together. 

I have no idea if people are gonna read this at all. I you did thanks a lot for sticking till the very end ❤️

1mc4zzj,life feels so dull for no reason,"im hardly on here, so im not even sure anyone will see this, but i honestly don’t know who to talk to, or if this is even something worth bringing up. i dont really have a reason to feel this dull or low, but i do. its not like i cant enjoy anything at all, i still can, but there’s this constant, underlying sense that everything feels kind of flat and feels like im kinda just “here”. ive also noticed that when people ask me to hang out, it feels more like a chore than something to look forward to. usually ill try to find some excuse why i can’t hang out and stay home, on the rare occasion i say yes, im usually able to enjoy it a bit, but the dread beforehand sucks. is my depression maybe making a comeback? could it be a sign i need to up my dose? or am i just being dramatic, any opinions are appreciated

1mc4xpo,"I don’t want to romanticize Depression, but","I’ve been depressed since I was young. And the past few years has been the best times of my life thanks to my husband. We’ve dated back in high school and rekindled. He helps keep me grounded and reminds me to stay present. He literally knows me in and out. I’m in the healthiest relationship I could ever imagined and he’s so understanding. 

But I always find myself finding comfort in my depression through music or sad things in general to get me in the mood. (Or I just crave it) I know it’s not healthy, but it feels like a security blanket. Odd I know.. I don’t stay in it for long, but a few days in it and I have to remind myself at times to bounce back and I feel better after. 😅. 

In our conversation: him “Do you thrive in depression?”  

Me “I do.. it’s like a drug that runs through my veins..
It has become part of me.”

And I know depression is a silent struggle and how lonely it can get. As humans we still crave human interactions and understanding. 

I’m just wondering if it’s just me or does anyone else find comfort from their depression.

1mc4kne,I need help,"I keep having dreams of committing suicide. I have a regret of telling my friends and my mother that I am depressed, therapy doesn't work, I'm convinced I've gotten so used to my meds that they don't work anymore, my friends think it's cowardice to commit suicide despite the fact that I've told them about wanting to try it. Not to mention the one and only person that I've told my struggles to, as great as he is, I feel a level of regret telling him as well. He hasn't done anything bad but I'm not the type to talk about how I feel to people. Last night I had a dream that I was in my kitchen and I had a gun pointed to my head, everyone I knew was trying to stop me from pulling the trigger, but I did anyways. Part of me wishes it was a reality, minus the part where everyone I knew tried to stop me, I don't want to be stopped honestly, I wish it was a real thing that happened. I die, I don't want a funeral, nor be cremated, just let me rot by myself. Sorry if I sound dramatic and the fact that this post was a long one, but I am genuinely trying to change but I don't see it working at all.

1mc4am7,I am at my lowest,"I (M15) am at my lowest ever right now. I know that some people will say that cant be true because I am still Young but in the last time Happend so much shit that I cant comprehend.
At the begining of the Summer holydays I went to a Party with some of my Friends and my girlfriend. She lives in another Country so I dont See her often, but she was at her Friends House this time(one of my Friends). At the Party we were pretty drunk and we kissed and made out.

A week later my sister turned 18 and invited her and my Friends to her Party. I thought this Would be just another Nice Party where me and my gf has some fun, but when she was there she did Not even look at me. 3 Hours in I realised that she did Not want anything to do with me anymore which my Friends confirmed. 
I then downed Shot After Shot and quicly became so drunk that I couldnt read anything because it was so blurry. After some time doing this she came up to me and Said that she was sorry for that and that she did Not feel anything while Kissing and making out. So that is how She broke up with me. 

Around this Moment a colleague from work came by, who I was good with and we talked for a Bit.
I have a very pretty friend but she is in my class so I Would Never Date her(the one my gf is staying). But she Loves to Party and Drink. The Problem is she always Drinks so much that she is Not able to realise what is happening and so she cannot defend herself from people who want to touch her. She also does Not remember anything the next Day when she is drunk.
My colleague knows this and just focused on her.
Because I was to drunk to protect her from him he used his Chance to take her with him somewhere and rape her. 

And now I make myself alligations that it was all my fault and I should have been able to protect her. 
Because of These two things I am now Highlight depressed and am thinking to end my life. 
Everything Reminds me of my ex gf and because the dude who raped my friend is my colleague I have to See him quite often and he has the nerves to joke about it and to Talk disgusting and Bad about her.

1mc42pb,is there something inherently wrong with me,"16f. I've never really been much of an introvert (though I try to avoid going out when I can). I make friends pretty easily and I can talk to most people, yet I'm struggling in my relationships. Many of my friends in school have been actively leaving me out of activities and conversations. I feel like an accessory to most groups and my presence feels expendable. I don't get into drama, I don't talk shit about anyone I'm friends with, and I overcompensate by taking on their habits of speaking, humor, and interests so they can like me a bit more. As I went into high school, I molded myself to become more appealing to people and I made a lot of friends, yet all that effort feels ultimately futile. I don't belong anywhere I go, not since the day I was born. I'm the black sheep of my family (yes, even as an only child), the stain in my friend groups, and the one floater everybody goes to when their ""actual"" friends can be with them. I only have one really good friend, but she lives in a different state. Even then, she always talks about how close she is with her boyfriend and other best friends and I can't help but feel worse and even lonelier.

Even simple interactions with people are tiresome and trite. Every conversation I have with people feels like small talk. I don't enjoy anything. I try so hard, but I can't feel fulfilled by any conversation I have with them. It feels like time dilates, and I can feel my mind materialize and piece together huge rifts between me and everybody else. I'm missing something that makes them click--something that I don't have.

A lot of this has manifested into deep insecurities about my own faculties. I feel much less accomplished, talented, pretty, intelligent, witty, and charismatic than everybody else around me. I feel like a shell of a human being with no outstanding traits. I have my own interests, my own identity, and a good idea as my standing as a human being--yet I can't help but feel inadequate/emptier to everybody else. Talents I thought I had, and a vision for a future that I manifested for so long, seem to be slipping through my fingers like an inviscid liquid. I feel like nothing, I feel like I am a nobody. I can't achieve anything.

I don't like feeling this way. I don't know what to do. My therapist, my parents, and my best friend don't understand me and they don't give me any solutions or steps. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just a naturally a socially inept person? My mom and dad say I'm incredibly sarcastic wording on rude, but that's how a lot of my ""friends"" at school talk to me too. Or it is just my lack of admirable traits? I've noticed that all the more academically high achieving people and conventionally attractive people tend to accumulate friends very easily. My therapist, my friend, and my parents have all said that it's not my fault but if its happening within every social group I'm in, there has to be a common denominator, right?

1mc3txa,One of those nights,"
I feel like every other day I’m having like this weird reality check that this is my life. That I’m really a 24 year old with a dead mom and a father that’s never been in my life . Which at this point I truly don’t know even know if he’s alive. Like I can’t believe there is someone on this earth that I came from that wants nothing to do with me that I wouldn’t recognize if I passed by them, a complete stranger. It makes you wonder if my own father doesn’t even want me who would? Is this normal? was this something I was supposed to normalize and pretend like I can still have a good life . When I feel so isolated from literally every other human being. I feel so disconnected. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. When I’m working I feel responsible like an adult. When I’m distracted. When I have time to breathe I feel like a lost child. When I have time to take In my reality I’d rather be anywhere else than in my own body. I’m extremely delayed it’s like I’m always this 15 year old. No confidence , wanting to go unnoticed but be seen as “normal” embarrassed of my family dynamic. Never feeling like I’m valuable, likable enough. Then I get older and older and before I know it I’ll be 48 still feeling like that 15 year old. My mom died at 48 I hope I die sooner. I don’t have anything to do here but suffer. To be used and get nothing in return. Just feeling like the 15 year old that no wanted after mom died . Now I’m the 24 year old that people still don’t want. ",1753769390.0,2025-07-29 06:09:50+00:00,3,1,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3txa/one_of_those_nights/
1mc3pk0,Struggling rn,"I am a child abuse survivor. My parents had substance use issues as well as depressive tendencies. I was basically ignored or abused my whole childhood. I have adhd and didn't get the support I needed so I didn't do well in school. My older sister was the one they wanted.  

I basically planned to cut them out of my life since I was 6. I moved out, got my life together, managed to start a career and found a way to survive when I thought that would be impossible for someone like me. I'm married to a guy that treats me well and though our relationship isn't perfect, when we have problems he's on my team and willing to work on it with me. No kids, I didn't want any, then he didn't want any, now we're both considering it but circumstances and finances scare us. I spent a lot of my childhood lonely and friendless. But I even have friends now that I see every weekend.  

My grandpa passed and left me enough money to get a down payment on a house. A stable safe home was what I dreamed of having someday. It's what kept me pushing forward through all the hard times and academic bullshit. Interest rates are high but with our combined income we can make our mortgage payments. I work two jobs. Husbands job is really nice and pays for our health insurance.  

But it feels like something inside me broke once I got what I wanted more than anything in life. I have a house, but I'm not happy. I feel empty. Times are uncertain and I may get laid off, and in our city the major employer is letting people go. I've been trying to find a better job already so I don't have to work 2, but it's been a year, 3 interviews and nothing. I'm unsure if the skills I have are good enough now that there's ai. I'm so tired now. It makes me wonder what is the point? If this all wasn't enough for me, why am I trying so hard? Will I ever be happy?  

I can feel my therapist getting frustrated with me. She's seen me pull through worse stuff than this without feeling hopeless. But back then I had my dream home to look forward to someday at the end of it all. And I feel lost and directionless now that I have it and I feel less certain of my future than ever. I know I did all those things to get here. I should be resilient enough to survive whatever happens in life and I know that any life I make for myself could be a good one. But that part of me feels so far away. Like I can't be that anymore.

1mc3kzs,"hi. i hate myself, and want to die.","i've self-harmed since i was 14. i don't remember why i started. i think i've just always hated myself. the way i look, sound, act. 

i've never had big family issues. a few fights with my grandfather, but i always respected him. when i still lived with them, my older sibling never learned how to drive so i was stuck driving them to school when my dad wasn't able to, limiting time i could spend working or just doing other things - that was pretty annoying. even now they bother me a lot with tech advice they would be better off just looking up, and they always ask at the worst times like when i'm really busy at work. i feel bad for thinking of them as useless at times, since i know they've dealt with similar mental struggles, but i can't help it. anyway, it didn't help - but wasn't the instigator since that was well after i started cutting myself anyway.

i was pretty good in school until the end of high school. at that point i felt pretty committed to being a content creator, so i was just trying to graduate and move on. barely did, and moved onto community college - dropped out after two years. went okay for a bit, but eventually my motivation completely died, started failing classes and eventually just stopped going entirely. self-harm only got worse throughout. content creation never worked out, but that's fine - it sounds like a miserable job nowadays anyway.

my first job was working a small gas station for a grocery store. somehow, i hated it. it'd be 8 hours to myself, not doing much for the most part. i'd bring my switch and played a lot of fire emblem and animal crossing. it should've been fine, should've been easy, but i somehow found a way to make it worse. i hated whenever people payed with anything but a card, for some reason - despite only taking a few seconds to deal with them. i don't understand why, but it made me so angry. maybe it was because i had brought a game to play, and they were ""taking me away from it,"" despite it being my job. i don't know. brains fucked. still did that for 6 years though, for some reason. somewhere in that time i started to burn myself alongside cutting myself plenty.

not gonna say what i do now, but it is a lot better. my boss can be pretty stubborn and stupid sometimes, and that's leading to a lot of stress right now. for a few years i didn't cut myself as much, just every few months i'd go a bit crazy to let it all out. i think the recent stress is really getting to me cause i'm back to cutting/burning every day, but oh well.

i still hate myself. i still think about killing myself all the time. i'm surprised none of my wounds have ever gottten infected, since i do next to nothing to actually treat them. some of my roomates know about this, but they haven't said anything about it in years. they were only ever really aware because of a vent twitter i had, but i deleted that ages ago - so from their perspective, everything is probably fine now. i always feel like i'm just one really bad day away from offing myself.

writing this, my life really hasn't seemed that bad - and that just makes me feel worse for all this. other people have had it so much worse, and here i am with a generally pretty good life making the worst decisions possible. guess i'm just a naturally useless piece of shit, huh?",1753768478.0,2025-07-29 05:54:38+00:00,3,0,depression,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3kzs/hi_i_hate_myself_and_want_to_die/

Sometimes I wonder if I’m the only person who gives energy to my friends. Whenever they rant or anything, I would always reply. But no one do the same for me. It kind of triggered me today and I just felt helpless.

It also doesn’t help for a fact that in my internship office, the interns dont share what are they talking about. I just feel stressed today

I know I don’t have the intelligent but I wish they would ask me more. 

I felt useless, idiotic, I don’t understand why I am still alive. I keep wanting to hang myself but of course I part of my brain won’t do it. I’m using this community to calm myself down as I’ve been distressed for the past few hours.

Then, 2 years ago, I thought I found the love of my live. The suicidal thoughts almost vanished for the most of the time. It felt SO good, you can't imagine. Life was FUN. To be mentally well is such a privilege.

For context: Caused by my traumatic past, I became very codependent and I'm very anxious of being abandondent and left alone.

1mc2fc6,How do I help my partner?,"Hi there (I'm using a throwaway account because my partner uses reddit and we follow each other, I don't want him to see this. I'm not a bot, I promise). I am looking for advice/stories/experiences/really any insight from anybody who has been in a similar situation, on either side. 

 
I (mid 20's F) have been with my partner (early 30's, M) for about 3 years now, and we've known each other for around 5-6 years total. We both have our own struggles with mental health, which we have both made steps to improve over the years. I am in a fairly good place, my depression tends to be cyclical, with a bad week coming up every couple of months or so, but I'm doing much better than I used to be. We just moved into a new rental house, which is the most space we've had in years. I have part-time job while also studying from home full-time as I work towards my Bachelor's degree. 


My partner hasn't had a steady job in the past 2-3 years. His mental health ruined his previous employment, and he has done a pre-trade course but has been unable to land a job in that industry, (not for a lack of trying on his part). He has hit a bit of a slump in the past 6 months or so. He was doing well for a while, motivated to learn and grow his skill set, and expand on his hobbies and interests, which he spends a good chunk of his time doing. But that motivation has faded. 


I want to make it clear that his lack of employment is not an issue for me, he pays his half of the rent and all of the bills, and I don't believe having a job is a big indicator of someone's personality, worth, or drive. 


My issue is that I don't know how to help him. I take care of the house, and the groceries, and planning dates and outings, on top of working and studying and caring for my parents and maintaining my social relationships. It's a lot. 


And it hurts. My heart hurts all the time because I can see he's in pain. I try to be there for him to lean on and talk to as much as I can, and he does talk about it. But I hear about how useless he feels, and how sad and full of despair and self-hatred he is. And it hurts so much. I don't know what to do. 


He is in therapy, he is on medication (has a review coming up to potentially up the dosage or explore new options), he is trying. I see him trying so hard and he feels like he's getting nowhere and I don't know how to help. I don't know how to make it better, or even stop it getting worse. 


He doesn't take it out on me, he tells me often how much he loves and appreciates me and everything I do, and he's there for me whenever I need or want anything at all. 


But I can't take away his pain, and that's all I want to do. Every day I see the person I love suffering, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. 


I feel useless, frustrated, angry at the world and the situation we find ourselves in. I'm so sad and so tired all of the time, but I keep going because I can't be the reason this all falls apart. I can't give him another reason why everything sucks.

1mc2di6,I kind of tried to kill myself,"Through out my life I've always wanted to disappear, therefore I always had suicide in my mind. I've never really tried, I always did these little things like ""if I have to take 1 pill l'll take 3-4 more, hopefully I die"". Recently I've had more of these thoughts or actions, but I don't really do it because I can't find a ""method"" and I don't want to bring more problems to my family by doing it. 
Yesterday I went to the bath and opened the water, I have had this thought about drowning some days ago, so I just wanted to know how it felt, you know, just another ""I'm not trying to kill myself, but I hope it kind of works ig"" let the water run through the bathtub, then I just lied down in the bathtub and I felt so peaceful, even though I had some thoughts. After I while of waiting I check the water, well, it didn't filled, then I remember my bathtub never worked that well for the bathtub, so we always use the shower. I hoped for the water to not go, I even put my feet in the drain, it didn't work. These days I think a lot about suicide, when I'm about to sleep, in my daily routine, even when I'm at work and I see these high structures. It is not as bad as it sounds, it may been happening for about a week maybe.
Anyways, I just wondered what these kind of thoughts are, or what happened with me, I'm kind of confused.",1753764286.0,2025-07-29 04:44:46+00:00,6,2,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc2di6/i_kind_of_tried_to_kill_myself/
1mc29mz,I'm depressed,"I'm fucking depressed right now, a lot happened. 3 years ago I was clean, was not suicidal anymore, started to improve a lot during the years, improving my education, I used to go to the gym everyday, had my packs, met a lot of people etc. (Improving shit basically), but what ruined it all is me caring for people that soon they'll betray me badly, left me in the dark, my uncle newborn died, my friend is suicidal, I gained weight, I'm helping a neighbor out as she is in a crisis (her husband and son passed away a couple of years ago and I'm there checking upon her and helping her), I don't have any friends, and I'm almost done with high school.

I missed the times when I was strong and not fat, and the times I cared for myself, but now I ruined that, and I know I can't bring it back. My depression is coming back, and my depression can get very bad

But what truly fucked me up is me helping the suicidal and depressed people, I regret it. I have a big heart, but it goes to the point that I care so much but motherfuckers betrays my ass and leaves me alone, it goes to a point I fucking hate people even more.

My psychiatrist is treating me for generalized anxiety (pregabalin) with medication after I told him I have generalized anxiety disorder. This is based on a book on the subject and his YouTube videos. My wife says I have ADHD (also based on a book she's currently reading :-)). This is a very fashionable diagnosis among psychiatrists and psychologists these days. I feel like I have depression – I took the Beck test and got a score of 27, ""Your symptoms suggest you have severe depression."" One thing is certain: I don't have suicidal thoughts, but nothing brings me joy, I have no motivation, and I'm depressed, my sleep is a mess. Is there a way, a test, to distinguish between these conditions?

I don't purposefully waste the car and walk into the road, I just walk on autopilot and cross the road without realizing, anyways, if I were to die instantly from a car crash I wouldn't be mad, I've been getting really mad lately to the point where I almost had a heart attack, and I was lowk happy thinking I was gonna die soon, but I clearly didn't. So the point is, I wanna die, but I'm not gonna kms, but I want something to kill me. Also, I hate myself because I feel like I have no right to be depressed. I live in a place in Lower Income central Florida in the US every house where I live is under 130k and 1 story, small yard, ugly trees, no community, sad, depressing, 1 bathroom, very small home. But thats the most of it, I have a park not to far from my house, but I have no friends so it doesn't matter. I have alot of stuff I guess, I have a ps4, an Xbox, a Nintendo switch, a PC, 2 monitors, a nice keyboard, a big TV, a bunk bed, everything a boy could want, so I should be happy. Right? Well, sadly no. I used to live in a really rich area, like house were 200k or more, still 1 story bc I'm not a millionaire, but it was a medium sized 2 bathroom house with a garage, with was so cool to me, U had everything when I lived there, friends, family to hang around, I enjoyed playing games and actually enjoying my life lowk. Then I moved, I lost all my happiness, I deadass cant get happy from anything, I love music but it all just makes me sad, any type of music makes me sad, I cant play my favorite games anymore bc they make me nostalgic and sad, I don't smile when doing anything, anymore and I don't feel like life will get any better, I fucking hate when happy idiots try to come up to me and tell me some bullshit like life gets better, it fucking doesn't so go fuck yourself, I hate when people who live in 2 story houses with more than 3 rooms try to tell me something like they understand, they fucking don't, im miserable, I hate my fucking life. Deadass got nothing to live for and I'm never gonna own a house and Im never gonna find the love that I want, like I said I would kms rn and livestream it for those who wanna see, but its too expensive so whatever, I guess. Anyways sorry for wasting your time, ask me anything.

Tonight I tried calling her because I was feeling suicidal and depressed and just wanted someone to talk to.  I’ve honestly been in a very dark place and desperate. Instead of comforting me she went on a rant how I’m manipulative and treated her very badly because I never take her advice. She said think about how it makes ME feel when you don’t take my advice it makes me feel useless. I honestly think she’s the manipulative one for saying that.  Just because I’m not cured doesn’t mean I’m not following your advice like wtf. It made me feel 1000x worse and more of a reason to isolate. I can’t believe she would talk to me that way when I’m clearly suffering. It was honestly such a shock that I was struggling to find the words. She wants me to call her back tomorrow to tell her I’ve followed the advice she’s given and I said no im not. I just needed a kind ear and instead I got yelled at. No wonder I want to die.

1mc1852,Hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either. And honestly, I don’t think anyone can help me, other than ending it all.

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half, but it only seems to help for a few hours at a time.

1mc13xy,I hate this so much.,"I don't know if this is anything serious, but I always feel like everyone is talking about me or is judging me. I feel like their a camera in my light with no lightbulb, I keep convincing myself it's there and I covered my posters and family pictures with sticky notes on my wall because I felt like they were judging me. I also feel so weird with my long mirror on my closet door and I'm convinced someone is watching me through it even though no ones there. I act like i'm talking to a human in my mirror and that someone is watching and judging my every move on the other side, I avoid watching or writing things in front of my mirror and I always want to cover it because I always get a feeling someone is watching me in the comfort of my own room. Everything that has eyes in my room I feel judges me, I'm also convinced that my stuffed animals have cameras in their eyes and someone is posting the footage and that's why people give me weird looks in public or watch me. Whenever my parents and family members  are speaking in  creole which I don't understand I always feel like their talking about me or being rude in front of my face. Sometimes I know their talking about me too. I wish I didn't feel like this and this isn't the first time I felt everyone didn't like me too, during the school year I was actually thinking of suicide and I might have been depressed, but I don't want to say that because if I wasn't I might come off as rude and ""Self Diagnosing"" and I feel bad for thinking I was. I just feel like theirs so much going on and I don't want to be sad ever again after everything that happened with my feelings during the school year and I'm scared to feel like that again.

1mc0wou,My life was over before it ever even began. (rant),"I'm a 33 year old man. I wasted my entire young life wallowing in self-loathing, and indulging in destructive habits, mental, emotional, and physical. I've never been athletic and I was never taught anything about nutrition. I was smart when I was young, but lazy, and a chronic procrastinator. Needless to say my mind and my body have just about wasted away.

About a year ago I made the decision to join the Army. I had nothing going for me anyways. I hated the menial, servile jobs I was working. The military was a huge opportunity for somebody like me. Not only would I be getting payed to be trained in a field that is actually my dream job, I would have a chance to change my mind, and my body around.

I've been putting in a ton of effort. I gave up drinking alcohol, I gave up caffeine to help fix my sleep, I completely overhauled my diet to the point of being obsessive, and I've been exercising harder than I've ever exercised in my life... or so I thought. For all my effort, I haven't seen any much improvement if at all. I don't feel stronger at the gym, running never gets any easier, and I don't look any better. But I acknowledge that it's my fault. I guess I'm actually not trying as hard as it feels like. I'm weak as hell, and although I sweat a lot and strain my muscles, I always leave the gym feeling like I could have and should have done more. People say that exercise is great for depression, but I often leave feeling down, and angry at myself for being so inferior. I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been in my life and it's so pathetic to say that my best is still worse than the base line.

I feel like I only just started truly trying, and yet it feels like it's already too late. I feel old. My body hurts. I have knee and lower back pain. I'm ugly, I hate my body, I have no confidence. I'm surrounded by young, athletic guys in their prime. They're smarter that me, have more going for them than me. I don't fit in with anybody. I feel like I don't get other people and other people don't get me. I don't have any friends here or back at home. I feel lonely, sad and angry all the time, and I don't have anybody to talk to. I feel like a rat trapped in a cage and I don't see anything ever improving.",1753759618.0,2025-07-29 03:26:58+00:00,64,10,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc0wou/my_life_was_over_before_it_ever_even_began_rant/
1mc0n4q,I don’t want to attend my sister’s wedding….,"Growing up, my mother always seemed to favor my older sister over me and my other sister. From the way my older sister was treated compared to us, it was easy to think that she was better in every way and was destined for great things. She always excelled in school and the arts. She has a lot of friends and is undeniably the most beautiful out of all the siblings. I hate to admit it, but it always hurt me to see her succeed. It’s always seemed like she’s living life on easy mode. I’ve seen her have her moments, but she bounces back so quickly. And she never had a problem getting a man. Me, on the other hand, have had the worst luck in love. 

There was no doubt in my mind she would find somebody. Of course it ended up being a handsome 23 year old with a successful career. She met him when she moved to Ohio for school and the rest is history. I always hated when she’d come to visit because it constantly reminded me that I had nobody. I don’t hate my sister, I just hate that she has everything I want: a thriving school life, large group of loyal friends, the perfect boyfriend. 

I hate that I do this when I’m emotional, but in my moments of breaking down, I often wished she would eventually end up single again like me so I wouldn’t feel so ashamed that I didn’t have anybody. Well, recently they got engaged, and I locked myself in my room and cried until I was blind from rage/distress. 

Everyone in my family is gushing about their wedding plans and how magical it’s going to be, while I’m dreading when that day comes in about a year. I don’t want to be there, not because I have any ill will towards her or her boyfriend, but because I don’t want to ruin her special day by being a depressed and miserable wreck. 

I know she probably wants me there for support, but I can’t help but think I’ll be a burden. I just couldn’t handle it. She deserves to have a stress free day. I’ll just stay home and get drunk I guess. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my sister. I just don’t understand why it seems like everything goes right for her and my life has just been me constantly contemplating suicide.

Life has never just been okay and doing anything is just a battle. And if I need to take antidepressants to be numb why not just do drugs at this point. I had a pretty rough childhood and have an incredible hard time connecting with and generally trusting people so I have absolutely no support system. Even when I try I feel like an outsider.

1mbylxb,Venting and need support,"First time posting here. I [29 F] have been struggling with depression since I was eleven years old. I’ve been living in survival mode since I was a baby. My father was not present in my life. My mother was so abusive to me. She taught me to ignore my intuition (even though I still feel it) and never taught me about boundaries. I was her emotional punching bag and therapist all throughout my childhood. This dynamic set me up to be abused as an adult, by people I’ve been in relationships with and my friends. I have never felt safe for long. I turned to drugs and alcohol for many years and it helped in the short term, but made things so much worse exponentially. I’ve been abstaining from alcohol for almost six months now. I am in a healthy relationship for the first time ever and it’s like my self-hatred is even louder. I can tell it’s bringing my partner down. I am in therapy weekly as much as I can, but my therapist is out of town for weeks at a time multiple times a year (at least three times in the past six months) which could be normal, I know therapists need a break, but I’m not sure the dynamic works for me. I feel like I just vent to her in our sessions. My depression always gets worse around my period, but in general, I am always sad and internalizing everything and punishing myself. I am finally seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow to try and get diagnosed and get on meds. My therapist believes I have OCD, depression, anxiety, and CPTSD. It hurts so bad. I’ve wanted to give up so much. I am embarrassed as well and feel so terrible for the weight I have put on my partner’s shoulders. They assure me they love me and want to see this through with me, but I feel so guilty and spiral because of the guilt. I am trying, but it is so hard. I am so strong to keep going, but I am scared it’ll be too much one day. All this suffering feels like it outweighs the good times in my life.

1mbyf30,I'm kinda not depressed. Just detached from my real emotions.,"No matter what medicine I take, it only changes how my usual feeling about life feels like. I still have this enormous hole or wound that feels like my soul is escaping out from. Sometimes usually when talking to people about it or becoming sucked in to the Convo I can get distracted for seconds at most.
But it feels so obvious that I'm detached from the strong emotions I have inside, that I guess are too painful or intense I'd rather be numb from them. It doesn't feel like depression, more like an energy that's being drained slowly when I'm not living the life I'm supposed to. It's quite scary that it feels like my chest everyday becomes more and more light(dissasioated from my heartbeat) because I can't stand how uncomfortable it feels to feel my heart barely pulsating. 

It really feels more like my confidence gets smaller and thereby my feelings for life. I have no will, no strength and no movement. It's just me, thinking about nothing and doing nothing. Can medicine really help me open up that wound inside me? It feels impossible. I'm only on an NDRI and antipsychotics so nothing really for anxiety or increasing serotonin. But I'm kinda done, I've tried Citalopram and short term anxiety medicine and it's just kinda changing how my confidence or happiness feels- not making it better or worse.

It makes me hopeless. ",1753752310.0,2025-07-29 01:25:10+00:00,1,0,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbyf30/im_kinda_not_depressed_just_detached_from_my_real/
1mbyaw2,Lost marriage,"So it’s the day after our anniversary, which you’d think would be a happy time, but no… today was awful. All day, my wife has been playing the sad card, saying they’re unhappy and hate the day. I’m still getting blamed for all the problems in the relationship. I don’t get it. It’s like nothing can ever be their fault.

Here’s the kicker though: when I got home, they acted like everything was perfectly fine. Like they hadn’t spent the whole day tearing me down emotionally, and then they wonder why I’m upset. It’s like they become a completely different person, acting like they have zero idea why I’d be hurting.

I tried to make our anniversary meaningful. I didn’t expect much, since they kept saying, “don’t get me anything, I don’t want to celebrate.” But then they gave me a card. I had one too, I just wasn’t planning on giving it but decided to after I saw they got me a card. I didn’t want to be rude, but it’s still sitting there unopened. And while I don’t need them to read it, they’re clearly making a point to point out they haven’t opened it, like they just want to hurt me.

Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling depressed. I’m tired of having my emotions stomped on. It’s getting harder and harder to cope with this kind of treatment. I miss being happy. I miss enjoying life. I can’t feel those things anymore because I’m constantly walking on eggshells.

The hardest part of all this is our child. A divorce would be brutal, especially when it comes to custody. My partner acts like they’re entitled to full custody, such as they joke about it often, saying things like “when I leave you, our child will stay with me.” They say it like it’s funny, but it hurts. Because this kid is my whole world.

I’m the one getting them up every morning, taking them to school, picking them up, getting them ready for bed, showing up to every school event and activity. I’m the one who rearranges my work schedule if they get sick. I do all of that, and I don’t even complain because I love my child, but it’s just expected of me. And when I do have responsibilities at work and can’t drop everything, my partner loses it, giving me every reason they can’t do it instead and that I need to drop everything instead of them. 

It’s like my work isn’t seen as important or valued at all. They seem to think what I do is easy or meaningless. My therapist says this behavior is narcissistic, and honestly, I agree. I also think there are deeper mood issues going on.

I just want to be happy again. I put on a mask every day, pretending things are fine while emotionally I feel like I’ve been beaten up. I’m already on medication for anxiety, and while that helps a bit, the depression has gotten worse over the past year. I feel lost.

1mby4lz,"25F, burned out with no desire to try anymore.","Hi all. As the title says, I’m a 25F, with barely any motivation to keep on keeping on. I was a gifted kid. Always had energy & motivation to work hard in school. Played on competitive sports teams all throughout middle school & high-school. Went to college, got my Bachelor’s like I was supposed to. Only for my first job to drain the ever-living fuck out of me. Got a new mostly remote job (in accounting), and I still feel the effects. I work from home 4/5 days/week which is great, but the job itself is already overwhelming. Actually, everything else outside of this job feels overwhelming. I no longer want to socialize on the weekends. I’m far too mentally drained to socialize during the weekdays so I mostly self-isolate now. I used to love working out, and now I haven’t seen a gym in years. I’ve gotten to the point where pretty much everything feels pointless. As a result, I’ve become extremely lazy and disorganized, and the only time I feel relieved from stress is when I drink, which is pretty much everyday now. All I do on the weekends is stay at home & sleep and drink with my boyfriend. I feel awful about this, because he suggests things we could do, but all I want to do is stay in bed with him. He deserves better.

Logically, I know I should just get a new job or switch careers, but even that feels exhausting right now, especially with how the job market is. Even if I did, I’m starting to feel like the whole 9-5 corporate bullshit just isn’t for me. Life has to be more than staring at a screen for 40 hours/week. I have no passion for anything anymore. Week by week, the feeling just gets worse. While I would never end it (can’t hurt my loved ones), at night I’ve started to pray for the universe/god to take me in my sleep because then I would truly be at peace. I genuinely don’t know how to fix this, because this tiredness isn’t something that sleep can fix and trust me, I’ve tried. I don’t know where to go from here, because I want to get better and love life again, but it’s like my mind & body won’t let me. 

Any advice or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1753751502.0,2025-07-29 01:11:42+00:00,6,2,depression,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mby4lz/25f_burned_out_with_no_desire_to_try_anymore/
1mby1km,I hate myself.,"Growing up I had a troubled childhood, my mom pushed my dad out of my life when I was 2, didn’t see him again until I was 18. My mom had a few different boyfriends, didn’t learn half of their names, then when I was 4 or 5 she was with a dude until I was 14. They adopted a baby, and I wish they never did tbh. He SA’d me from age 8 to 12. I tried to unalive myself multiple times until I was 16, was into drugs pretty heavily, until I got pregnant at 20. I got my shit together and was seeing somebody, moved in together, and broke up after 3 years. I moved into my mom’s house, as rent other places was insane, and I couldn’t afford anything as a now single mom.  The baby my mom adopted is now 18, he steals from me, and mom, my grandma and even my 7 year old.  He smokes weed CONSTANTLY in the house, where my 7 year old and elderly bedridden grandma live, and my mom doesn’t even ask him to stop. She lets him do absolutely anything he wants and he gets away with shit all the time because she simply doesn’t care. I hate even leaving my bedroom, being around my mom makes me anxious and I genuinely feel like I don’t even love her I just tolerate her, and it makes me hate myself, but o feel like she’s never been a mom, I feel like she never actually cared about any of us. I have 3 older brothers, too, they all left the second they could and I feel like they kind of feel the same on some level, they all love her because they have to because she’s their mom, but why don’t I feel that way? Am I broken? Because the fact she lets my brother do anything and everything just irritates me so much and it’s put so much strain on me. Recently he went into my grandmas wallet, took her debit card and went to the ATM and took $1100. And what did my mother do? Nothing. He denied it, then when he admitted it, she did nothing. Because he threatens to unalive himself. For fucking why? Because he’s gotten everything he fucken wants and needs, his life isn’t shitty by any means, my mom and her ex aren’t together but her ex is married and my brother visits him twice a month and gets whatever the he wants there too.. the last therapist I went to told me I have depression and anxiety and I need to practice my breathing.. like wtf even is that? I stopped seeing her cause that’s ridiculous. Also I feel like if I say too much, there’s gonna be cops involved and then I’ll be out on my ass with my kid and have no family at all, and idk.. am I broken? I just turned 29 and I feel like my whole life is a mess.. if I could afford to move, I’d be in a different country honestly.. anybody looking for a slightly damaged 29 year old with a 7 year old boy? 😂 if I don’t laugh I’ll cry.

1mbxzka,"I have depression, and my 4 month old son needs surgery.","Hello, Reddit. I see people use this place for all kinds of things so this is me trying to use it. I’m scared. Last year I had a mental health crisis, and I went to spend a week at a facility and it was the best thing that happened to me. I work in a hospital, and I see all kinds and deal with all kinds of stuff. But nothing could prepare me for when I was my own worst enemy and ended up planing my own death. It was a fleeting thought, I immediately told someone at the hospital and ended up in a PESS unit for 24 hours, then a behavioral health unit for a week. 

Diagnosed and treated for clinical depression. Apparently the care team thinks I’ve had it since I was about ten when my grandfather was killed in 9/11. But this isn’t about that. This is about how after everything, I’m feeling better. My wife gets pregnant, I’m on top of the world, and my son is born with Sagittal synostosis, also known as scaphocephaly, is a condition where the sagittal suture, a fibrous joint on top of the skull, fuses prematurely.

We took him to CHOP in Philadelphia, got him the best of the best and we did everything early enough where his surgery is scheduled for mid August. It’s not considered brain surgery, but a neurosurgeon is going to be present because of the nature of the surgery. But I shook the hand of the man who was going to put my baby boy to sleep, cut his skull open and place springs inside it. 

Of course I’m glad it’s happening. But I just got my world put back together. I’m scared, and with my depression I’m worried that I might let my own mental get in the way of the fact that he’s going to be ok. I can look at statistics, and do all the research all I want. We even met families who have perfectly healthy babies taking the exact same care team as us. 

But there is a voice in my head, warning me that I don’t know what I’m going to do if something happened to my son. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking apart from prayers and kind words for a father who is battling his own demons every day like I’m sure many of you are while also giving 100% of my concern and energy into my boy. He’s my whole world.

I don’t have a job despite trying and even giving my resumes to businesses that aren’t hiring. I tried DoorDashing and Uber and theyre not hiring in my area. My bills are overdue and my power is about to turned off tomorrow (thank you PG&E for the 48 hr notice ig). 

Objectively I have a good life, I don’t pay rent and just have to take care of the house I live in, and I only have to pay for amenities like power, water, etc. I have a working car. I’m doing fairly decent in school and even joined the student council at my college. 

I have so many things going for me and so many things I haven’t done yet in my life and yet just one stumble like bills or stress from being jobless makes me wanna die. 

It’s not even sadness that I feel, it just feels like… suicide is a *not good* solution for whatever problem i have, if that makes sense. It always feels like theres a gun on the table.

I guess my question is how to take the solution of suicide off the table? And deal with stress like a normal person ig? 

I dont have friends to talk to and I already worry my mom too much about my mental health so I don’t want to tell her. I went on a walk around my house to see if I’d feel better.

1mbxsip,Why am I so depressed when everything is fine?,"Sorry, this is kinda long…

Hi! I’m 15F, and I don’t understand anything. I understand I’m a kid/teen, and I’m just super young. I’m immature, but I’m positive I have depression. I was never diagnosed because of my parents beliefs. My dad thinks that depression is a phase and what I’m feeling will go away. But it doesn’t. It’s been stuck with me since 5th grade.

I feel so guilty because people have it way worse than me, and my ass is complaining, hurting myself, and fantasizing about my own death. I live fine. I’m middle class, and I live comfortably. I have parents who immigrated to the states to give me a better life. They give me what I want and need, and I appreciate them with all my heart. I have friends, I don’t get bullied much, and I have a wonderful boyfriend. So why do I feel so lonely? I'm depressed all day, and all I think about is dying or hurting myself. I can’t get out of bed; I don’t have motivation to do anything. I can’t even take care of my hygiene. I just want to die, but I hate pain. My life seems so good, but I look like an ungrateful brat. 

I told my parents about hurting myself and depression, and all I got was “think positive,” “we don’t believe in therapy,” “you have nothing to be depressed about,” “are you hurting yourself for attention?” and more. It hurts so much hearing that from family. I have no motivation to live, but the only thing keeping me alive is pain because I don’t have the balls to take my own life. I’m scared. I have no plans for the future, and I know I’m young, but time passes. I’ll end up on the streets or living in my parents basement being a nobody. I want to get better.

1mbxoz6,Am I depressed or just sad,"I’ve never posted on here (I rarely post on Reddit at all),  but I guess need to know what’s going on. I’m just really upset at the moment. It’s obviously summer and the entire time I’ve been feeling really hopeless. To give context, my mom’s an addict and she hasn’t lived at home for almost a year now. She’s been in and out of treatment for about three years, and even now that she’s better, I still feel like she can’t offer support. I’m going into my junior year in high school and as a highly ambitious student, I wish I had the same support and resources offered by my friends parents. Everyone’s off doing things and traveling and doing internships and being with other people but I’ve been stuck at home almost daily because dad works and mom isn’t here. All I’ve done this summer is practice my sport in the evenings. A few weeks ago I fell into my first truly depressive episode- I guess I just realized things would never get better at home. School and my sport and everything else that being an older teen brings are hard enough with support. I’m usually thrilled to start the new school year, but recently I feel like I have nothing to live for. I know people are usually like “it’ll get better don’t say that” yada yada but I genuinely believe that. Sometimes I cry for hours on end just because each day feels like a period to fill. Suicidal thoughts aren’t rare. I came to my mom the other day (a nurse) and said I needed to see someone.

Has anyone, literally ANYONE who’ve been depressed, taken meds and it’s off them and can happily say they’ve beaten depression and aren’t depressed anymore?

I am 27f and since i was 23 and dropped out of college ive felt this new specific hopelessness. I have done nothing about it. I continuously spiral down the drain. 

I once tried therapy in college but they didnt seem very genuine in helping me. Granted i didnt have much to say and i guess our dynamic wasnt matched. She gave me a planner at the end of the session but it felt like the very last thing i needed. I suppose i knew i was never going to write anything in it. Im horrible at organization and a huge procrastinator. Oh boy have i always been terrible at homework. So how can i get better and make a life for myself? Where do i begin?

-Anyway ive just been living day to day trying not to regret my life.  I have people pleased nearly all my life. I have childhood memories or people pleasing. Im of course in the spiral. “I want to do this , but im not good enough” “ I could do this but now its too late” “Where do i start?/How do i start?”year after year i do this to myself. I’ve discovered from my upbringing, from abuse, from generally being misunderstood as a person (because i am in the category neurodivergent ) - i have DEEPLY rooted imposter syndrome.

1mbx6c0,I tried suicide but I failed.,"I'm 19 years old and let's start from the very start of my life when I was born. My mother gave birth to a premature baby 1 month premature I was supposed to be born on October but september is my birthday month. This shit caused something in my lungs I was on baby ventilator for 6 months. Before I was born my family was very rich like the richest of the city but my father and his older brother had some issues and he snitched and income tax raid was there in my house so everything was gone. My father would legit walk 7-8 kms weekly just to get me injections when I was 1 year old. We were 3 brothers. Let's say for example. Special brother, older brother and me. My special brother was mentally challenged he was born right but due to some fever he got some mental illness. I'm the youngest brother special brother was older than me like 5 years and older brother was the oldest he was 8 years older than me. After my special brother became a disabled child my mother opened a NGO daycare centre for all special needs child just because she knew what pain the parents feel to take care of the child and she would do it for free. 2012 the special brother passed away... I uh I don't know what to say about it but I cried a lot. As I said I had lung issues so In my childhood i was not able to play any sports I used to like basketball but if I dare to play it. My lungs would just take me to bed for another month making me a living dead body. Finally when I was healing and became healthy in 2017 my father used to earn well we even made 2 houses and all suddenly he got a brain stroke and everything stopped. I used to live in the centre of a city and doctors told my father that he needs to go somewhere quiet. When you're just entering your teenage years and this happens your whole life changes. I was so shocked. I cried a lot. I screamed. We shifted out of city into a town of Hilly area. My brother was just 19 when my father had the stroke so he took responsibility of the business. My mother was also struggling to keep the ngo running because there was no money to invest. And donations were not enough. Then slowly my brother became very angry and my new father. He used to beat me. He legit choked me once till I gave up on living. My dad was the same he used to beat us when we were children aswell. Well lockdown time comes around corona. My father owned several warehouses of wine and alcohol and my brother used to manage it. He started drinking. He was very brave. He was very strong. His confident would legit shake anyone standing in front of him he made several contracts with the army and started a construction company and used to take contracts with army itself. I was in another small school. The school was owned by a friend of my mother's. In that school i started learning music. Annual function came I did my performance and it was so lit everyone started clapping and shouting my name. Every single parent there clapped but my father was not there 🥺 I was so sad I cried on spot and told everyone I'm just too happy but my mother knew it. Everytime in morning I would see father's dropping their son's off the school and loving them and here I am that one cursed child. My mother developed a heart disease in which her heart valve is leaking. My father called me and shouted that's what you wanted motherfucker your mom's gonna die. I cried that day aswell everyone in my house was fighting and I was the youngest so I was the first to be beaten. I tried killing myself 2018 but I could not when I tried to hang myself i accidentally chewed my tongue due to immense pressure on my throat and immediately did a pull-up on the fan and removed the cloth. Lockdown passed by my brother got married and his wife knew nothing about home. How to iron and all everything I taught her because she asked for. One random day my father tells me that go around the block and show her everything like near house. I grabbed the umbrella because I had a feeling it was about to rain and it did but his wife was there without umbrella and to i offered her that you can have it I will quickly run back home she said no let's just keep going. In one umbrella I was like okay if u want then she held me hand and that shit was so bad I told her I'm not like this. Straight of she laughed it off like I'm a joke then one day she was ironing clothes ( everyone in my house irons their clothes themselves ) I told her to  set the temp lower as it was a thinner shirt of my brothers she told me how to I showed her nd she kissed me dude. I told her again that please stay in your limits your my brothers wife and she looked at me this time and told me to leave strictly. I tried to tell my brother but I was scared that he will think it's me because it's always a man's fault. After some weeks she was gone to her hometown for some work and from there she told my brother that your younger brother tired to grab me and pushed me on to bed and tried to kiss me. My brother said that to my parents in front of me when I was eating the food..I was so shocked and I told everything he hit me and said don't fool me you're always like this and he kept hitting me I was unable to walk. That day I told him you trusted that lady of few weeks over a brother of 17 years. Don't talk to me ever again. And we never talked straight forward ever again. My brother had a babygirl on October 2nd and he was so happy. He died at a young age of 26 on 29th March 2023. 😔 After that I came to know about the truth in his voice recordings there are numerous arguments of him and his wife and one of them is about me that my brother would never touch you so she cried and my brother said alright I'll make him away from u. I can't live both of my brother's died my father is paralyzed my mother has heart issues I wanna commit suicide. I wanna die asap my birthday is on 17th September and I have made up my mind that I'll kill myself on that day cause I genuinely can't take it anymore:( I used to hate my brother but he was trying to save me all along and 🥺 even when he died I could not do anything to save him. When he died my mother shouted at my face that it should have been you and not him. I'm so broken. I can't anymore. Please god if you're listening I have seen enough now please.

1mbwddr,Probably A Reflection Of My Life Choices,"I could probably write a memoir of unfortunate events, twists I never saw coming, and coping methods that had less than desired outcomes. Not drugs or anything like that - but it suffices to say, the perhaps the road to hell truly is paved with good intentions, and probably accurately describes my attempts at a happy life. I have a lot, don’t get me wrong. I wonderful house, a well paying job, a beautiful child, and a loving husband who tries his best. 

At the end of the day I’ve slowly lost every connection outside of our little family and feel largely alone as each chapter has unfolded until there’s all but a few characters left in the story. I can’t help but think it is me, and I think I am just rather frankly unlikable, have gotten to a level of desperation for connection, and/or not in a position to give the attention a relationship requires to have one.

The quick and dirty: 
1. Drunk mom and a few steps from poverty - signed up for the navy to go to school and start life on the right foot. Left behind myself sister to suffer in that hell alone, and lost her later in years because of her sanity, to which I heavily blame myself for having left to save myself.
2. Met a wonderful man and knew what I loving family was like - followed through with enlistment to “change my stars” - lost it all, he couldn’t handle deployments and many of my friendships faded with time along with this.
3. Fell in love while in, and regrettably turned out he was married. It ruined my rep and I had to leave. Lost friends of course there too, or perhaps realized I didn’t really have any.
4. Decided to be empathic to above asshole’s situation (it was a marriage for citizenship)and paid the price several times over for this, as his facade faltered over the years. This cost me friends and family and ruined my self confidence and sense of self worth.
5. I moved out of the state for work after graduating to get out of a dead end job and start a career with the education I’d managed to obtain. Lost more friends in some pretty spectacularly disappointing ways - some as petty as asking them to pay their portion of a cell phone bill as I struggled fanatically myself, and some family died in the interim. 
5.1 Married my childhood love and lost the respect of the adopted family I once called mine - because I “stole him” when I moved. So much to the point that they begged him not to marry me.
6. Made some no contact choices because of toxicity to stop the panic attacks with what life line relationships I had left - the desperation for contact was not worth the strife and punishment to foster it.
7. Made friends and close to family in the new place, but had a child. We moved back so my husband could have his family, and our child could know what was left of hers. This family tolerates me at best, but it’s clear I am not welcome nor valued in that space.
8. I am in a management role with a young child to care for and no opportunity to foster relationships. But at this point, I get the feeling that I lack friends not just because I am not in a position to have them, but rather because people do not see me as someone they’d care to engage with. 

I often get the distinct feeling that no one wants me around unless they get something out of it - sex, money, leverage, work related assistance, etc. I run myself into the ground for people for little to know reason hoping for value in some one’s eyes, I’ve come to realize perhaps it’s because I was only valued if I was quiet, did what I was told, and did chores as a child. No time was ever spent together to just - be together, as a family. Perhaps this is why I fail here now, with no example of how to just be. I’ve often wondered if I ever had the skillset to make a true friend - and it must be a skill, because I fail at it horribly. As a result I feel empty and the face I put on for my family is getting harder and harder to fake. I don’t know what to do - and no clubs, meetups, etc aren’t the answer here, though I appreciate the advisement to do so.

I just don’t know what to do, and while on paper in my nuclear family, it’s a successful life, the loneliness and lack of support is driving me into a hollow suit of a person who now just makes the perfunctory moves to appear present and engaged for their sakes and theirs alone. Or I’d likely be gone.

1mbw6xu,depressed over my nose,"This is the first time i post on a forum but i hope i will feel better if i let this out. When i was young i had an accident where i fell with my head on the ground and broke my nose. This lead to disformed unnatural nose with a huge droopy bulbous tip. It also has a hump and its overall huge. I ve been bullied because of this during school by boys and girls with the most humiliating unhuman ways. The people that i consider friends also mocked me, even my own father once told me ''how did your nose grow up this way'' and it hurts since today. During this period as a teenager i tried to use all this pain as fuel to succeed in school, so i could prove both to myself and others that i am more than just a deformed characteristic. And it worked, i got into the best university in my country and was succesfull. That time my nose didnt bother me so much because I believed (pushed myself to believe) that I can be happy in life only with what I accomplish. Today, six years after school, nothing has changed. I cant look myself in the mirror without getting depressed or even panick attacks, and whenever someone takes a photo of me I feel like i want to die. As a 24 year old male I have urges to talk to women (I wish i didnt) but thats just impossible when I cant even see myself in the mirror , and remembering when I was younger how girls mocked me and laughed at my face because of this. The last months have been the worst , depression kicked in hard and my nose has become an obsession, I think of it every minute , I dont want to leave my room and be around other people with this deformed thing in the middle of my face. I opened up to my mother today beacause she understood I am depressed for the past few months and I made her cry after explaining to her how I hate my life and myself and  how people have treated me since i was a teenager. I will never forgive myself for making her cry, but i tried to keep this to myself and she wouldnt let me. So, i ve come to the sad but true conclusion that the only thing that matters in life is looks, I can win the nobel prize and still people will identify me for my hidious deformed nose. I think everyday of getting a nosejob but I am ashamed of what people will say, not the ones that bullied me but the ones that actually liked me as a friend. I hope one day I get the surgery and be able to look myself in the mirror and stop feeling like a decease. But even if I do im concerned that no woman would like to engage in a relationship with a man that has lived his life since he was 25+ like this. I just hope I never fell and broke it. For the last year what i once used as a fuel to succeed in life has become an obsession that doesnt let me concentrate in anything and keeps me depressed, because i cant fool myself anymore into believing that i can be happy in life just by studing hard and getting good grades, I have social and romantic needs, which i wish i didnt have but i do as a human being.Overall, im tired of this fucked up world and all this people that hurted me so bad so i prefer staying in my room forever and not interacting with anyone. For all the people out there that feel this way and have experienced  the same pain I have, i want you to know I feel you and I truly wish you the best.

1mbw5lw,I cope by imagining im a superhero,"Not quite as the caption says, but almost.

For starters, I’d like to clarify that im in my last year of high-school.

Whenever I feel upset or bad, I begin to imagine that im a superhero, and that I have cool superpowers with my friends (people i made up) and that people look up to my determination, and will to never give up.

But when that fantasy cracks, and im forced to take a look at myself, I see that im nothing like that at all. I see that I could never be the hero that I imagine.

All my peers are getting jobs, driving, going out with friends, and enjoying their best years. Meanwhile, I’ve struggled so much to even feel like im a kid, and not just a whiny adult with no will to change. 

When the fantasy leaves, I realize how pathetic I am, and just how much I could never be that hero, that isn’t selfish. The hero that always helps others, and the hero that never gives up no matter the odds.

The truth is that my few friends barely even talk to me, I can’t do anything consistently enough to make any progress, and im selfish enough to only think of myself.

I wanted to be that hero so bad. I really did. 

I hate the real me. And I hate how much I struggle to change even the littlest of things about myself. I know i’ll never be the hero.

1mbvsj4,I have a hard time opening up about my mental health and I think I understand why.,"I've never wanted to be a burden. I've never wanted people to worry so much about me if they're going through things in life that could be arguably worse. But I think I've realized a big part of why I dont loke talking about the state of my mental health: I don't like the repetitive, cliché advice that comes from it even if the other party means well.

Things may not get better.

Romantic love is not a guarantee in life.

Therapy is not a one size fits all however helpful it could be and that relies so much on the therapist themselves. There are a lot of terrible therapists, it seems.

And it's like, what can I reasonably expect them to do? It's nice to have an ear but I can imagine it be so tiring to hear these things as if it's so easy. Everytime I feel the urge to open up to a friend the next day the feeling wanes because I just don't want to hear what everyone says to someone depressed.

I'll most likely die with my feelings bottled up and the inherent regret that comes with it.",1753745132.0,2025-07-28 23:25:32+00:00,1,1,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbvsj4/i_have_a_hard_time_opening_up_about_my_mental/

1mbmcwv,I feel so miserable it feels like my head is about to split open," I'm genuinely losing my mind and I don't know what to do

It's an understatement to say that I feel horrible right now. I feel suffocated I'm losing my mind it's driving me crazy I wanna k1ll myself. I won't actually do it but my thoughts r getting worse I keep wanting to do smth damaging. I can't cry I have no control over anything. Everyday tasks are driving me crazy im angry and irritable everything is so difficult my sleep routine is an absolute mess I sleep around 4 and wake up 12 hours later all groggy and miserable.

 I even started a remote paid internship recently but quit it after a week because I couldn't wake up early every day and the work was overwhelming. I can't help but beat myself up over it. Everyone else does internships and jobs but why am I incapable of doing anything productive? I want money and I can't go a day without thinking and thinking about money and how I can earn it so I don't have to be so worried. And it's not irrational because I actually need it. Everything requires money.

I am overwhelmed byy sensory issues. My clothes make me uncomfortable. Sometimes I get such sensory overload everything makes me uncomfortable and I wanna rip my skin apart. My clothes my bra my hair, even the fat in my body. I feel ugly and I actually have a huge belly  there's disproportionate amount of fat there and it stresses me out like crazy.  Whenever I feel it I get extremely u comfortable and wanna grab a knife and cut it off. Im Muslim and I can't pray on time. It does not even take that much time but it's fkn tiring. I can't make wuzu (ablution) bc the feeling of getting wet pisses me off. I can't stop scrolling on my phone and no deleting insta isn't an option bc then Im still on my phone doing nothing.

I also have anhedonia so nothing is enjoyable, not even the things I used to find fun and enjoyable. I go to the gym sometimes I can't be consistent . First because of that f*ckass internship and sometimes I don't wake up on time and can't go. I am mentally paralyzed I have executive dysfunction and I can't do anything! I eat compulsively the most unhealthy stuff ever. I feel compelled to eat even if I'm not hungry. I cannot fix my eating habits. I need to lose weight too so this makes me even more stressed. I'm thinking about food all the time to the point that it's fkn tiring. Its bc it produces that quick hit of dopamine. I'm so tired of this lifestyle. 

I'm so damn worried about my future I have so many dreams and ambitions but I can't do anything that'll help me progress towards them. I'm in my last year of uni and I should be more productive. 

And btw I do go to therapy and even take meds. I have a really good psychiatrist so it does help but I'm going thru a horrible phase in life. 2025 has got to be my second worst year. I need to go more frequently. She even said that I should come more frequently and it's fine if I can't pay I can come without paying but I couldn't go a week ago bc of that internship and now she's on a leave for a week or two so it'll take time. I desperately need smth. Im fantasizing abt smth happening to me so I can get attention. 

The sad thing is that I've tried so many medications but sht doesn't work for me. Atp I think they could lobotomize me and it still won't work. I wish they could just euthanize people like me. My doctor is v careful abt the meds she prescribes tho but it just sucks that no trial of meds works for me.

I desperately need help but I'm not sure how anything will help atp. I can't even cry and let it all out but even if I do it won't fix anything. 

I'm sorry for this long post I'm just genuinely losing my mind please I'd appreciate if u read it.

TLDR; I’m extremely overwhelmed and mentally exhausted to the point that i think I'm going insane . Struggling with executive dysfunction, sensory overload, body image issues, anhedonia, and financial stress. Therapy and meds haven’t helped much lately. I feel stuck, hopeless, and like nothing is working, even though I’m trying.",1753723275.0,2025-07-28 17:21:15+00:00,1,0,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbmcwv/i_feel_so_miserable_it_feels_like_my_head_is/
1mbf6cw,"untreated for 5 years, unmedicated for 8. it’s over","i don’t know if triggering warnings are required here, but obvious TW for some SH talk, SA, and suicidal ideation 


i (19F) was always the “star kid”. i’m level 2 autistic (formally dx in 2024), so i was hyperlexic & started preschool at 2. i’ve always been the “smart” child, or “golden goose”, because everyone on both sides of my family believes that even if every other niece/nephew/grandchild fails, i would be the top earner. my mother suspected autism around age 3, due to me covering my ears in any slightly loud settings. my mother also recalls me having nervous tics and trembling all the time, around kindergarten age (5). obviously, doctors in 2008 were still very behind on autism, and since i was “smart” they said i was perfectly fine, and sent me off with medical grade earplugs. i didn’t begin to feel “different” until my social deficits became clear around 4th grade. i was bullied almost every school year, but it didn’t become “intentional” until then. due to this, i started showing signs of depression at 10 years old (mainly feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation). i remember during the summer before middle school, i’d go in the shower just to sit on the floor and cry almost every day. i binge ate as well to suppress my emotions, and ended up gaining about 40 pounds that summer alone. i tried asking my parents for treatment, but i come from a caribbean household that didn’t “believe” in depression or “telling our business” to a therapist, and that it was “white girl stuff”. 

in my sophomore year of high school, i managed to start therapy with my school psychologist, and did DBT as my only form of treatment from 15-17, and was diagnosed with MDD & ADHD-PI shortly after starting. despite this, my mental state worsened (mainly due to being unmedicated, but i was also bullied heavily in my junior year) and i spiraled into a severe self-harm addiction at 16 (currently somewhat clean from that). my episode at 16 (between nov 2021-may 2022) was the absolute closest i’ve ever been to seriously taking my life. i scheduled emails to be sent, bought the necessary tools, and planned to do it after AP exams. i was only stopped on april 1st 2022, when i spoke to my guidance counselor (vaguely) and she basically performed a crisis intervention with my school psychologist. even though i should have 100% been hospitalized then, my parents just told me to “stop seeking attention”. when i was going to college, i lost my only form of treatment. i tried asking my parents again to do therapy & medication to ensure my success at college, but again was met with the same answer. 

in my fall semester of freshman year, i mentally spiraled again and coped by using sex as a form of self-harm. this led to me being raped by a former partner in november of that year. i had also failed almost every class, ending the semester with a 1.3 GPA & on academic probation. after telling my parents about the sexual assault (approximately a week after it happened), my father berated me for “putting myself in that position” and called me a whore, damaged goods, disgusting, etc. i was never given a safe space to process that trauma, and just pushed it down immediately the same way i did with my depression symptoms. 

i became actively suicidal in the beginning of 2024 for that reason, and when confessing this to a very close friend, he contacted my mother directly to basically say “you’ve fucked up for too long, and if you don’t get over yourself we’ll lose her within the year”. scared my mom shitless so i started tele health therapy in march of 2024. at this time, i also started 300mg wellbutrin. despite taking meds, i was always passively suicidal. something in my mind always tells me that i should’ve died during my severe episode at 16, and i don’t think it’ll ever go away.

as of now, im entering my junior year of college. i’m currently taking 300mg wellbutrin, 20mg adderall, and 5mg lexapro daily. mentally, i feel stunted. i feel like i genuinely sustained some sort of brain damage from having my MDD untreated for so long, because it genuinely cannot be healthy for someone to have their brain tell them daily that they’re just need to get it over with for almost 10 years of their life, in tandem with bullying, emotional abuse, and unresolved trauma. i drink every night, because it’s the only way to calm the thoughts & paranoia, but im terrified of this turning into alcoholism (autistic adults are at higher risk for substance abuse). i start EMDR in august, and i’m getting an ESA kitty to help alleviate my symptoms related to my GAD & dorm paranoia from my trauma. 

i’m genuinely hoping that my new approaches, beginnings and help from my therapist + PMHNP will make a difference. despite being actively/passively suicidal for half my life, i’ve always had a strong plan for my future and i genuinely want to see that come to fruition. but i fear that if things don’t change or my MDD turns out to be treatment resistant, i give myself a good 10-15 years before i just give in.

TL;DR: high functioning MDD left untreated for too long, and i feel like my brain has suffered irreversible damage due to symptoms persisting after therapy & meds",1753706699.0,2025-07-28 12:44:59+00:00,1,0,depression,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbf6cw/untreated_for_5_years_unmedicated_for_8_its_over/

So slowly that I almost didn't notice. About 2 months ago I went to the doctor to get my sertraline dose up and it's done nothing. I don't know what to do. I'm 16f and I feel like my parents aren't caring. Which is weird because they cared so much when I was ill previously. I've been to hospital several times and I've needed stitches and stuff and they were usually (not always) very supportive. But now that it's coming back it's like they don't want to know. The relief they must've felt when I started healing it's like they don't want it to go to waste and they don't want to do it all over again so they just ignore, pretend it's not happening. They tell me to get active, I am. They tell me to do things to help myself, I do. I do all the things that i did when I was healed. I shower every day and i get dressed, I leave my room and house and I keep my room clean, i look after myself in all ways I can but it doesn't help despite what my parents have drilled into my head.

I feel so jealous of people with amnesia because they get to pick and choose what they remember, what they choose to keep. I know it doesn’t really work like that but the most craven irrational parts of me are still envious

I just want to forget all of the bad things. I’ve got a major trauma anniversary coming up and I’ve not really got anything going for me. Nothing seems worth it anyways. I’m medicated so I can take care of myself and pretend to be happy but nothing ever feels worth it. I feel like a robot, like a facade of a human being.

I used to be such a creative, happy, imaginative child, but that all ended one day. Now I’m just rotting while I’m still alive. I like feeling sad because at least it means I’m not numb, but maybe that’s the way to not exist- by not feeling anything at all.

Once this desire starts, it stays with me for so long. I’m either scared or angry these days, I don’t know which is worse. At least when I’m scared I don’t lash out at people around me. I just want to feel okay but I know that I’m doing everything I can. There’s no way out of this.

I’m just tired of caring so much. I’m just tired of everyone else being selfish and refusing to understand parts of me they find objectionable.

I'm already on two antidepressants and they are not helping at all. I'm slowly but surely losing everybody and everything. I have suicidal thoughts nearly all day everyday. All I have to look forward to is opioids tomorrow then it's back to hell. My soul cannot take this any longer. I can't get any help because I don't have any money or insurance. I don't have a working car anymore. I've lost everything because I can't function. I haven't showered or washed my clothes in weeks. I'm only eating once every day or two.

I can barely put into words how absolutely God awful this is. I just want it to stop. I am in so much pain. Please tell me I'm not alone.

Edit: I am very shocked at how many people showed up here and the amount of support and individuals that have shown me that I am not alone. I feel great today simply for the fact that I am on an opioid but tomorrow when the high is gone I'm sure the depression will come back with a vengeance.

1mbthui,I don't particularly want a long life.,"I'm not actively suicidal, and it's not like I *want* to die. I simply do not want to live to 70, 80, 90 - it just sounds very tiring, to be honest. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying there's anything wrong or bad with being old - I do hope my grandparents and parents get to have a nice long retirement - I'm saying I'm personally not particularly keen on the idea. I just want to be able to reach my goals, make a positive impact on those around me, and hopefully go out in a non-painful way. Will I regret not being able to see more of life? Maybe. But I'd rather have a well-lived life than a long life that I never lived at all. 

I'm not the type of person to follow the traditional trajectory of life. I don't expect to have much family or friends when I'm older; I have always been very introverted and more interested in losing myself in my interests than socializing. Some people would call it sad but it works for me, and the few close friends I have understand me well. I know a lot of people want to live a good long life, maybe with the person they love and their family - I don't, not really. Maybe it's because of my struggles with mental health, with family issues, maybe it's something intrinsic to who I am, but I just don't. At 13 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 18, at 18 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 25, and I don't see that changing. I've made my peace that I'll likely always struggle with my mental health; nowadays I just want to make the most of the time I do have on this earth.

I've never told anybody in my real life about this. I'm a fairly ambitious person, and I am a risk-taker, more often than not at my own detriment. I know the people who genuinely love me want me to play it safe, live a long and quiet life, but that's not me. I'm not going to be able to settle for that, not when it's way too close to how I've been living - being alive solely because you're not dead, and you have too many regrets to pass on. I pretend I understand where they're coming from but in reality I genuinely can not give up on my goals, and I can not worry them by straight up saying I don't want to stay here for very long.",1753739360.0,2025-07-28 21:49:20+00:00,2,0,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbthui/i_dont_particularly_want_a_long_life/

I lost interest in everything. I liked so many things and now? I hate everything… i just wanna be home, listen to music or play some games just to escape this stupid reality.

1mbsz6s,Are having thoughts of just wanting to be old and die a sign of depression?,23M. For the past 2 years I have always been thinking about how I just want to be old and be close to death and be done with life. I always have jealousy for all the older people who have their life pretty much finished  and done. I don't have goals or motivations that I really care about and just live because I have no other choice. Nothing really excites me anymore as it once did 4+ years ago.

I stayed in love with her for those years and would say “I love you” when she did something cute or anything that made me happy or feel like she the one, or I don’t know how to put it in words but she would say that a manipulation tactic, and first off I never cheated on someone before nor did those thing so I didn’t know why she said that and it scared me and for 1 whole years she would get pissed at me and hurt me which I learn to listen and talk to her but some how it always ended in I’m wrong and she was right. She started to say I make her want to kill/cut herself and it made me not me I couldn’t talk nor feel emotions at some times and she would get annoyed at that, btw me and her never met in person we plan too but after yesterday she gone. But idk why I can’t let her go, I started to write how I felt and how I love her which I just started crying.
And I changed myself for her which ik isnt good thing to do, throw out the year of her saying how badly she wish she could kill me or she was dead I stop eating, I used to way 190 big boy ik lol now I way 146 idk if she was even good for me but I don’t know why if she was so bad toxic why do I feel so much love for her?

1mbs5hl,"neverending grief, lost hope","I'm 24 and I've been on antidepressants for 5 years now but medicated and dealing with mental health in general since 15 years old so you could imagine that I'm used to not feeling well basically. I'm a sad and nostalgic person diagnosed with multiple things along with depression, you know the deal.

My issue is, I cannot handle grief. I'm not saying that the rest of the world handles grief with grace and gets over it quickly, but I just cannot deal with the concept of death and loss, it's something that pushes me into a dark abyss each time I think I might be getting better and the only thing that I can think of is: I hope I die right now so I stop feeling like this and I don't care if I get over this, because this will happen again. So I feel hopeless.

Earlier this year my 7 month old kitten was killed by a dog and till this day I can't stop crying about her. I got her to gain some kind of purpose? in my life (you know, something else to do apart from the job I hate), she was everything I ever dreamed of, and it was abruptly taken away from me. And violently. And bloody. And I saw everything. And I was alone. I can't stop thinking about it, I can't stop dreaming about that moment and feeling guilty about it. 

I talk about this with my therapist almost every session and the thing she told me is that I need to start remembering her in a good way, like the good memories I had with her, but each time i try to even think about the goofy things she did the violent scenario I lived interrupts the nice and warm feeling of her memory. 

I need to talk about her. I want to talk about her. I need to keep her alive in my mind, but for some reason I don't think is healthy anymore. I try to not compare myself but it is inevitable. I feel like im overreacting by being this sad about a cat (which I know it has way more meaning) when there are people who lost their children?? I just don't understand why I cannot stop being sad about my cat. She died on Feb this year. Is this amount of sad normal? What can I do? My psych has tripled my sertraline since my cat died. 

I feel so vulnerable because I know for a fact that this will happen again. My dog will die. My parents will die. Everyone I ever cared of will die. So what's the point? I don't think I'm made for this type of suffering. I don't want this. I don't want to get over this, I just don't want to deal with this at all. Does that make sense? I don't think I'm built for grief like the rest of the world is, I never get over things. I'm still grieving things that happened when I was 12. 

I feel like living is jumping from suffering to suffering, and I don't feel like the good moments (because there are really good moments in life) compensate the shitty ones, so I feel hopeless and I don't really want to participate in life anymore. I just don't like this. I need advice.",1753736211.0,2025-07-28 20:56:51+00:00,1,0,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbs5hl/neverending_grief_lost_hope/

1mbrwyw,Struggling my whole life,"For the past 18 years of my life I have watched every ounce of love I had for anything disappear. I feel empty and without direction. The only reason I really do things anymore is to prevent myself from getting in trouble. For so much of my life, I realized I wasted it away attempting to find someone who would fall in love with me. Most things I do or have ever done have involved at least a little bit of hope that someone will notice me.

I feel extreme guilt for the way I handled my grandmothers death. I was at the beach with my family when I learned she was put in hospice. I wish I knew her better. She was so kind and the things I know about her now make me regret never calling her. I was about 14 or 15 and I never had someone die before. Now I see my other grandparents getting older and it’s terrible. I know death is closer than I think, but my mind is always so occupied with imaginary situations of things being better that I forget to call them or ever respond to them. I feel terrible. 

I’m an attractive person, something which I am so happy about because it took me a really long time to get to where I am. But despite this, I have a terrible porn addiction. I realized last year I watch porn out of a desire to ruin myself. I know the terrible effects, and I keep on indulging myself because of both the dopamine rush and the belief that despite my looks may never be enough for someone. The things I watch have only gotten worse as the inner hatred grows. I know it’s both terrible for me and terrible in general. I hate it all and I hate that I keep doing it, but it’s familiar and I don’t have much familiarity. I used to think I was really good at handling change, but I think I’m so used to it that as long as there’s something to cling on to, good or bad, I won’t feel lost again.

I’m pretty sure my parents divorced because my dad was having an affair. Despite things being relatively okay between them, moving back and forth from house to house is exhausting. I have two rooms which don’t feel like home. I have to push myself to clean them. I sit in the shower and either bring my phone in and keep it out of the water or stare at the shower head. My showers can last 1-2 hours and my parents have given up on trying to make them shorter.

There was a moment when I went to my summer camp and I found this really scratchy old sweater at a thrift store. It was purple and I wore it every day for a week. I’m not sure why, but that was the only thing that ever made me feel safe. I left it by accident and I never really recovered. It made me feel pretty, and it made me warm when the nights were really cold there. 

I had a dream where I was a girl. I can remember it really well. It kinda hurts to think about. Gender has always been a confusing thing for me. I don’t know what I want to be or what I want to look like anymore. Everything seems inspired by whatever movies I’m watching. 

I’ve never told anybody about any of this. I have a therapist I’ve been seeing for a year and I could never bring myself to tell her. I’m so afraid of what people will think about me. I’m riddled with guilt and self hatred. I think the worst part is that when I hate myself, I act pragmatically and logically. I try to point out flaws and back them up with evidence. 

I’ve dated many people. Nearly all of them said they couldn’t date me because they weren’t attracted to me. They said I was extremely kind and they wanted to be friends but none of that ever worked out. No relationship lasted longer than 2 months, and I keep running into all of my exes at parties and so I find a bathroom and cry then pretend everything’s fine.

I know it’s depression, and I know it’s not real, but happiness is so rare. My phone is like a numbing agent, and I can just get lost in the lights and the sounds. I hope things get better. I hope I find that purple sweater. I hope my grandmas aren’t hurt. I hope I can’t find someone who really wants to be with me. I hope I can figure out who I am, and I hope I can open up to someone with no shame or hatred or shock.

TLDR: people always say I have sad eyes and I try to laugh it off every time, but unless I have a plan I sit inside all day on my phone and wish everything was different.

1mbrirl,"I can't stop grieving my mother's passing, even though it hasn't happened yet.","A few days ago I watched a YouTube video. It was just some recap of a short story by Isaac asimov, called ""the last answer."" I don't know what it was, but it caused me to spiral. I'm 21 now, almost 22, and the concept of mortality finally fully hit me. I've been thinking about how old my dog is, and how she has maybe a year left. Or my mom, whos around 54, and how her time is closing in as well. I spent so much of my life resenting her for things she has done, most of which brought on by her own trauma. I feel like I've avoided loving her for so long. And now that it's processed that one day she'll leave me, and I can't stop crying. Our relationship is better now than it was, much better, but I still can't shake my guilt. I know realistically I have a long time left, and she also has a good chunk, but I can't stop thinking about the end. I can't figure out how to go back to living in the moment. I learned that time only goes by faster as you age, and I am beyond terrified. There's a pit in my chest, and the more I think about the end the more time seems to fly. This past week has felt like a blur and an eternity. I'm so young. I'm so, so young. It's not fair that I'm feeling like this. It's just not fair. In all honesty, a lobotomy sounds nice right now. 

I'm sorry for the shitty formatting, and for the rant. I think i just need to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. I find it so perplexing how flagrantly death is treated. I know it's inevitable, but the fear of losing the people I love and the possibility of not being able to say goodbye is so fucking scary. I don't even think I'm afraid of death. I'm afraid of not knowing when it'll happen. Anyways, thank you for listening.

1mbr0we,Tired and not in the mood for anything,"I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm missing out on my life and my potential. I got my first computer at the age of 10 and it quickly became a great passion. Over the years, I discovered programming, 2D/3D graphics, reverse engineering and so on. 4 years ago, I finished my studies and wanted to become a freelance web developer, but to do so I had to build up a portfolio. So I spent several months programming on personal projects. Unfortunately, at that point I started to develop an intolerance to gluten, but also to junk food in general, so the food I ate had a huge impact on my mood and fatigue. Living with my parents, with no income, I'm very dependent on them. I don't eat very well at home; for example, a meal might consist of two small packets of potato chips. About 2 years ago, I started to develop anhedonia. I don't feel any cravings anymore. Neither for computers, nor for all the other things I used to enjoy. I feel as if I don't know who I am anymore, as if part of my identity has vanished, it's a horrible feeling.

Oh my god I'm so dumb for believing life had any other purpose. God I'm so dumb. It's all about having friends, it's like duh... But I actually started believing that my hobbies or self love would matter. But no, right when I'm starting to build confidence I get this sudden panic attack and feeling like all efforts are for nothing and I should've put more energy into talking to people my age. Oh well too bad it's what I want secretly to suffer so I feel different from others. I'm such a weird fucking creature actually. I'm actually a lunatic the way I behave and avoid having a social life at all costs. I need to kill myself fast unless I find friends, which I can't even STILL do in VRchat. Hahaha crazy. I guess people(me) never change ❤️😂

Like people don't even take me seriously anymore. When I'm crying and depressed it's just like ""get your sorry as away from me"". And I agree. I'm borderline retarded because I don't learn that socializing is the only thing that matters. -have a good day: spend it with friends. Have a bad day: you get to distract yourself with friends. Do anything: better with friends.

But yeah no I keep ""forgetting"" that life isn't about me, it's about fitting in. Fuck my dumb ass nerdy retarded ugly cringe fuck face that thinks he is above others. I secretly think I'm gonna be like cooler than everyone just cause I choose to be lonely. But then I end up here whining about being lonely you know what I deserve this shit. Don't wanna socialize? Then suffer alone. I serve no purpose except making people uncomfortable or sad. This shit is ridiculous. And I believed my family and therapist that I should believe in myself but u know what? No I fucking don't and I will never do until I feel included somewhere. Being alone is stranger bizarre and puts anyone at risk of mental issues. Fuck everything else except socializing. Workout? Try 3 x reps of talking to women instead and see how tough you are fucking faggot. To think I think I'm gay sometimes just shows how fucking strange I've become. I never get an answer, I never feel ok. I will when I'm included in a social circle that fits my view of ""cool"". And I'm tired of pretending anything else matters in terms of mental health.

1mbqu61,None of it feels real," nobody feels really truly genuine half of the time and they just end up feeling like scripted dialogue without any real thought or emotion behind it


I've been thinking about if I'll even leave a note when I decide to do it and sometimes I find relief in imagining my own death and how others will probably cry and mourn over me at least that will probably be genuine


I have been pushing myself for a year or two maybe three, I can't tell when this all started but I have slowly lost all desire to be human or to be a person


I've been faking my interactions with my psychologist or therapist or whatever they are for most of the time they ask if I'm suicidal and I say just a little and they ask if I have any intentions or plans and I say not really but I have almost every intention just not a solid plan


it make me a little sad that my family will most likely live to see me dead even the older ones but what am I supposed to do?


Sometimes in school I imagine I have a gun in my mouth and imagine what would happen if I shot myself in front of everyone


I hate that my few ways of escaping will soon disappear or be blocked behind other things I will have to do and so all I have left is my mind as imagination where I slowly rot inside and can feel myself becoming apathetic and even resentful towards others


A long while ago about a year ago on two occasions I put my mom's gun in my mouth and almost pulled the trigger since then it has been locked away in a safe


I have a knife that no one knows about in my room just a few feet from my bed hidden I think about using it every day


I am so behind in school that I have slowly stopped caring and have told myself it won't matter later because I'll be dead


I'll be a senior in a two weeks and I feel nothing no sense of accomplishment or pride just tired and hateful towards my education


I'm 17 and will most likely live a bit longer even if I don't want to at least until I am finally able to do it

1mbqgfa,I don’t know how to keep going. I just needed to say this somewhere.,"**Please stop scrolling for a moment.**

I’m not an influencer. I’m just a guy who lost almost everything -  
his home, his family, and his hope.

I’ve been working on an album for months (– no, this is no self promotion, this is a confession)  
not in a studio, but in an abandoned factory I live in.  
I’ve gone through a divorce, I barely see my son,  
I drive taxi at night and restore old car interiors during the day to survive.

**This month everything collapsed.**

A Bolt driver crashed into my car and insurance company took me just as a bad joke.  
Then a long taxi ride never got paid.  
Then I tore my tire which I replaced,  
but now I don’t even have money for fuel to continue my night drives.  
No joke – I’m days away from losing my last chance to survive.

But I didn’t want to go down quietly.

Yesterday, after a complete breakdown reached me,  
I recorded a raw **unplugged demo** of my last song...

No studio. No team. Just me,  
a mic, a DAW, a drum set made of a table,  
toilet paper stand holding a knife, spoon, ashtray –  
and every last bit of pain I had left.

This song is the only thing I have left.  
It might even be the last I ever release.

I put **all my pain** into it. I believed I can share it here... but only thing I found, I can't do it a way I need it. A way I have a time for... A way, that can save me...   
All the time I believed in words, that... well... Because sometimes one song can hold a whole human soul.

But this doesn't matter as well... I never used Reddit before, but hoped it will be the place where I can share my thoughts through my music... Or my words... F\*\*k... It's full of rules, you can't even move a wrong way without being deleted... I created this profile for starting my project 2 months in advance from now on, but well, I don't have any time left... I finished whole my album, but now I already know, that I won't have a chance to release it... It's just a matter of time (hours? maybe days?) till everything collapse completely under my hands. I don't have any other solution to this situation, only waiting even while I am still trying to survive, to work, to go on... But this system, this system is not forgetting... You fall down, so is there any help? Well, yeah... a hard kick right into your face and no more chance to get up, even when you need just a little time, a few days to catch up... few fc...in days more to catch up... no, money won't forget a bit, money is everything in this world... money means more than life... Just one week to catch the time up and I can hold everything together, but no way... I don't have this week... I am done... Don't know what to do anymore... I lived my life to find out it's ending up in my 40's... It's still too soon to fell down with no way back to normal life. I held myself for years, I was quite happy even when I lived here in this godforsaken place... but just few unlucky days in a row to find out your life ends here, at this point... I lost the fight already... One day? Two days? Maybe 3 days for mobile operator cuts me off from the world completely. Than even here, in this abandoned factory I pay rent... Yeah, another few days to loose this place... Debts rising faster than I can make money. System is set up that way... Falling down with no chance to get back... Great. I don't want to live this way anymore. I can't simply catch up that system. I CAN'T ANYMORE... If I disappear from here in the next days, it won’t be because I didn’t care, but because this world didn’t care enough to give me one more shot.

It is my confession...

  
If anyone is interested in this song, you can find it in my profile... As my first and also last shout to the world we live in... 

If anyone knows of any solution to the situation like this, please let me know. But I don't know any existing one...

1mbqcvv,"Despair, can someone help me what to do","I apologize for my post already. I have a breakdown and don't know what to do, really. 

I got diagnosed with depression at 15 and got medication and a bit of therapy. But then I got a bit happier again somehow...or I just accepted it, whatever happened. It helped slightly. But not enough. Then I stopped the meds. And I got worse. So I took them again. And this switched every few months. Now since a family member died I got some again, took them, they are now mostly finished and I don't get new ones. 

They tell me I feel too good to get meds. While I'm breaking down every second day. It is worse. I turn 18 in a few days and I see absolutely no future. It is even worse now. I get told I'm an adult and responsible for myself. I get called lazy and should be ashamed of myself. Useless is what I am. And I feel like it too. I hate myself. I wish I wouldn't. I can be so thankful for my life. 

Why am I so sad. I don't understand. I get told I need to go to therapy if I think my life is bad like this and if I do I will have to wait half a year or more for a place there. I am really crumbling but I'm scared I get locked up there. And the fact that I have to tell the therapist my whole life...I likely lie. 

Because some things are related to people in my life I still am close with. And I don't want to talk bad about them. Even if it is the truth. I don't believe myself anymore and I am totally isolated and distant from existense. What do I do guys...what do I do...does it sound bad or am I just overreacting...

I just can't anymore. I tried to write as short as possible so that at least someone maybe responds. I'm sorry. I'm desperate.",1753732152.0,2025-07-28 19:49:12+00:00,2,1,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbqcvv/despair_can_someone_help_me_what_to_do/

1mbpx0p,Have I got depression or am I just sad?,"Hello, I am a 23 year old female. I have an online business of things I make myself them sell on Etsy & eBay as a way of making money. I stay at home most days, as a lot of my family are severely disabled, and need 24/7 care. I do all the cooking (sometimes over 22 cooked meals a day), the washing, household chores ect.

I’ve always suffered with really bad anxiety, and also have always thought I have OCD, as I have a lot of the characteristics of it. I’ve always gone from periods of times when I’ve just felt sad & anxious, but over the past few months it’s intensified dramatically.

Last year I was diagnosed with FND, which Ik has affected me mentally without even perhaps realising at times. My Mum (who I absolutely adore, and would simply not be able to survive without) was diagnosed with cancer in March, although has been told it’s gone now with no further treatment. I don’t know if a mixture of these things have caused these feeling or not????

Lately I feel completely worthless, useless, miserable and like there is no point in carrying on. These feeling can last anywhere between days to hours but they are so intense. More intense than I have ever felt before. Sometimes I feel like I have to carry on because there are so many people relying on me to survive, which is often what keeps me going as ik they wouldn’t be able to cope if I wasn’t there to do the work around the house.

I feel especially with my diagnosis that my life is over, and I’m a total failure, I feel like I can never do anything wrong, everyone hates me, and everyone is waiting to just slag me off. I feel like I will forever be a burden on people and will end up permanently disabled (even though rationally ik there is no real reason for this). I have nothing to look forward to, only that everything will keep getting worse.

Sometimes I can feel ok. Occasionally even happy, but the feelings of overwhelming sadness, hopelessness and overthinking, almost like mood swings? It’s hard to describe but when I get into these moods/ feelings it’s just so so intense and consumes me.

I feel like I can’t talk to anyone as everyone is always so busy or have more important things going on in their lives. I honestly don’t know if maybe this is an intense OCD or anxiety episode or if I am depressed, hormonal, or just sad about life. Could anyway please offer me some advice about what they thing, and how I can move forward if I even can.

1mbpbjm,My depression made my life look pointless and I can't stop fearing this despite improving so much.,"Hello, I'll try to be as precise as possible. And before starting this: I apologize for any grammar mistake as english is not my main language or if I talk about my life a bit too much and sound like a jerk.

Last year I went through what I think that was the worst year of my life. The point is, because I was falling in a spiral of decay and depression I had to face the ""typical"" depression symptons:

Lack of motivation, anxiety, feeling that I'm worthless, that there's no point in doing anything... and a million more things that I'm sure you guys have been through. Like I mentioned, this happened last year and after realizing that the only solution to fixing myself was, well, myself, I was able to get out of that depression, to the point where I could think about those fears without going back into a state depression. (And I apologize if my way of wording it sounds like it was easy to fix it and offends anyone who's going through it, it's not my intention). So this year everything went very well, I won't say a lot but I got scouted for a big football club's youth team and I couldn't be happier but, then there's this one feeling that I still couldn't beat.   
  
The fear of knowing that I'll die sooner or later and that everything will feel pointless.. I don't want to age, I don't want to be an adult and go into my 20s, then 30s, 50s... and then miss being young and have regrets. It all feels so, depressing, I could be in the happiest moment of my life then I'll be hit with the ""you know once this is over you'll miss it, and then you'll age, and then die."" I hate it, I need help to cope and get over this because I just really don't want this thought to ruin every moment in my life. Heck I'm still so damn young yet I already miss being even younger, so what when I'm older? What will it be of me? Why does it feel like nostalgia is a poison? And the worst of all is when I'm trying to learn something, or improve myself and, despite being so damn young, my mind goes like ""hey it's too late for that, you'll be a grandpa sooner or later so then what? What's the point of working out for example if at some point I'll look in the mirror and be a grandpa, then what? what's next?""

And it's terrifying. I feel so egoistical, knowing many would kill to be in my position yet it seems only I would be unfortunate enough to sabotage myself when I should be grateful... But I just can't stop thinking about that fear... I really need help to understand it and challenge that though, I need to beat it and make sure this doesn't fuck up my life again after trying so much... I need to accept that death comes sooner or later and that life itself is meaningless but I just can't, sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up one day, or sometimes I just wish I hadn't been born at all. I really can't let this thought make me suffer my entire life.

I apologize for getting so personal and if I sound like a jerk. My life looks so perfect in the eyes of everyone but for whatever fucking reason, it doesn't in mine, fuckass ""you'll be old and die one day so why would you do anything"" hurts so much. And it makes me want to die, seriously.

TL;DR: Depression made me think life is pointless because we all die and it's still making me feel so bad despite improving my life so much and I can't find a reason in doing anything at all but at the same time I don't want to have an average life without achievements.",1753729802.0,2025-07-28 19:10:02+00:00,5,2,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbpbjm/my_depression_made_my_life_look_pointless_and_i/

I've known I was going downhill for years now but anyone I've spoken to about it didn't want to acknowledge it, doctors brush it off as something simple, my weight or just normal aches and pains but it's not, it never was.

1mbolts,I feel like depression is ruining my relationship,"I 22F am with an amazing man 22M. I genuinely see a future with this person but we both have depression and it gets really difficult to maintain our relationship. Sometimes when he’s depressed he isolates and sometimes I can feel him slipping away and it scares me deeply. I feel like my immediate response is to turn to him when I feel depressed but a lot of times when we hang out I just find myself feeling numb and not wanting to go out and do anything. He’ll even ask me why I feel sad around him all the time and I just feel so guilty. I want to be close to him, I want to feel happy, and I want him to feel happy. It sucks because I love him so much but I feel like our depression is just pushing each other away. I feel like his isolation pushes me away and my constant dark could pushes him away. Sometimes I feel like he’d rather be with his friends or alone than be with me because I can be such a bummer but I feel like those actions push me away further and make me more numb because I just feel guilt. It hurts a lot and I’m not sure what to do.  
I try and work out, eat well, see friends, do hobbies and i’m in therapy but everything just makes me feel so empty. I just want to have a happy relationship like we once did but we’re stuck in a loop. I don’t want to put the burden of my emotions on him because he has his own problems to face. And I don’t want to lose myself in my relationship either.

1mbo7jr,Professional help,"I have reached a point in my life where I have realized that I can no longer get anywhere on my own. There is nothing left of my former, adventurous, outgoing self. Since the end of last year, I've been living in seclusion and, when I'm not working (which works, albeit very exhaustingly, because I know that without a job I have a problem), I waste my entire life. I don't enjoy anything anymore, the smallest tasks are extremely overwhelming, if something doesn't go the way I want it to - no matter how trivial it is - I get incredibly angry. I avoid contact with my family and friends and when I do go out, it's also a huge task for me. My apartment is falling into disrepair, I can no longer manage the simplest household tasks, for example the last time I vacuumed was a few months ago or I sleep in an unmade bed because I can't bring myself to make it. I just waste my days off sitting in front of the PlayStation, watching reels on my cell phone or watching YouTube videos, even though I don't really feel like doing that either. My ex-girlfriend was still understanding until the end, tried to give me peace and space and even went on vacation with her aunt a few weeks ago because I didn't feel up to it. Of course, it also sapped her strength in the long run and we split up a few days ago. Since then, despite my endless sadness, I've somehow got a “burst of energy” (out of panic?). I want to get my life and my apartment back on track, I want to enjoy life again. It's only now that I've really realized just how bad the situation actually is.

Now the question: Who has ever been in a similar situation? What has helped? What is rather counterproductive? What would be an approach to possibly seeking professional help? If you would like to know anything else, please feel free to ask. Thank you!

1mbns92,Hopeless,"45m. I’ve been single for my entire adult life. I struggle with several mental and physical health challenges, including ADHD, depression, anxiety, sciatica, obesity, and a learning disability. These issues make daily life very difficult and have made it hard for me to build stability or move forward.

I live with my brother in Seattle, but I often feel like he sees me as a burden. I also hate where I live. The weather here makes me feel worse, and I don’t have the resources to move somewhere else or create the kind of environment I need to feel better.

Financially, I’m in a tough spot. I haven’t paid much into Social Security in nearly ten years, and I have no assets. I keep thinking about retirement and whether I’ll ever be able to afford it. Things are already so expensive, and it feels like the cost of living is only going to get worse. I don’t see a path where I’ll ever feel secure, and that uncertainty adds to the weight I carry every day.

I left my job to go back to school, hoping to make a fresh start, but now that I’m a year in, I worry I made a mistake. With how fast artificial intelligence is changing the job market, I’m afraid there won’t be work for someone like me by the time I graduate. It feels like everything is shifting, and I’m falling behind.

On top of all this, I feel incredibly alone. I’ve always wanted a significant other, someone to share life with, but it’s always felt out of reach. I want someone to talk to, someone who sees me and wants to be there. That kind of connection is something I’ve longed for, but I don’t know how to find it or whether I ever will.

All of this has left me feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. Lately, I’ve been asking myself what the point of any of this is and whether life is even worth continuing. I don’t know what kind of help I need, but I know I need support. I can’t keep doing this alone.",1753726412.0,2025-07-28 18:13:32+00:00,3,2,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbns92/hopeless/

While the shit of the world does the pushing, abusing, bullying.
Whether it’s by suicide, murder, or whatever, the kind hearted people will always be the first to go. The good people in this world will always suffer well before the scumbags of the world (if they even get their karma).
It hurts so bad to know that the bad ones always win. At least from my experience, the abusers and bullies always win. They’re better off in life and it’s a killer to be a witness to it.
The world is cruel and unfair.

I lost my job. Due to bad mental health and lack of money i don‘t have a drivers license so its practically impossible for me to find a new job. I live in a rural area.
My landlord wants to up my rent but still owes me money for insurance claims because of a fire. I can‘t just not pay rent because I know I will get kicked out. I have three cats and they‘re all I live for and I can‘t do that to them.
I have no insurance because of some stupid loophole. And as I live in a country where 99 percent of people are automatically insured there is no such thing as free healthcare for anyone who isnt insured.
ADHD and autism don‘t make life easier either and in a few days I need to send over pictures of my apartment to another insurance company in hopes of getting some money (because of the fire) but my flat is completely trashed because just surviving has been impossibly hard. But if I don‘t not only will I not get any insurance money but my landlord will have someone come over to inspect the place and the way it‘s looking atm I know he will immediately kick me out.
I have no real support system. No family. A few friends who know I‘m struggling but none of them is in a position to support me with anything besides words.

1mbjg1l,The first two weeks of August will be full of party. I just want to rot alone and die.,"In the first two weeks of August, I will be attending 5 birthdays, including my own. I'll be attending the celebration party of a close friend who will have successfully defended his undergrad thesis. I'll be attending the farewell party of a close friend who'll start her masters abroad. I'll be attending the ceremony where I will be lauded for having graduated as  top #1 of my class in aerospace engineering.


I wish to go to exactly zero of these places. I want to stay alone in my room. In fact, I want to kill myself.


I think I have gender dysphoria. I have no idea how the fuck did this idea get so ingrained in my brain, but this fucking bitch that controls my cognition just accepted it as being true. I had no problems with my identity before, and in a matter of mere weeks this spaghetti fucking mess decides that it feels more comfortable as a woman rather than my biological assigned gender. Yes, it is true, I indulged in play with my sister during childhood. Yes, it is true, I am pathologically more sensitive than the average male. Yes, it is true, I have had problems with not conforming to whatever the """"alpha male ideal"""" behavior is in my life. I'd say, even with all of that, looking rationally from outside, most of my strengths are male-typical. But, oh, my brain doesn't care. The mush in my head thinks it's a fucking woman now.


I despise and reject this feeling. I don't want to undergo HRT. I don't want to mutilate my genitals. I don't want to become a 2nd class citizen. That is NOT an option for me, and even less of an option in the culture and social circle I was raised in. But I don't want to accept the possibility that the prenatal hormonal environment or whatever did not appropriately differentiate my brain with that of my gonadal sex before I was even fucking born. I cannot accept that biology would give me that big of a middle finger. I want to feel comfortable with the body that was given to me. I want a neurosurgeon to access my hypothalamus and my BSTc and place an electrode and manually inject the fucking testosterone that was not given to me when it should have. Maybe that way I don't feel like a fucking f4g all the fucking time. Or just fucking sever that shit altogether and that way my brain becomes genderless and I don't have to care about this stupid identity crisis.


I am sick of this. The solution I want is clear in concept, but if I tell anyone they'll think I have become insane. My psychiatrist told me I may have OCD, but I'm not sure it's the case. Either way there's something genetic fucking people up in this family because I see my auntie, a law school graduate, living in an abandoned house with an overgrown garden with no job. She could not just be lazy and unmotivated. My older brother, an electrical eng, also valedictorian like me, is basically non-verbal at this point.

Dishes in the sink, for weeks, dishwasher full with bacteria growing inside the bathroom filthy filled with clothes all over. I was humiliated. I disgusted the man who came in. He took photos of the sink. He probably showed everyone. The garbage was so overrun he threw a piece of tissue in the sink. Water started running downstairs so he had to come in and fix it. 

I think was so noisy my neighbor moved out from under me. Im always home, fat, and up at night and the floor creek like crazy. I think She wanted to know who I was before I left. She said “I want to know if that's him” You can LOOK AT ME and  tell. Thank god her boyfriend stopped her. 

I went to school smelling like shit. Human shit like i shit on myself, so I left flight school after a short time.

 My car was so filthy the cops pulled me over and knew I looked like depression. He asked if I was okay and I teared up and almost broke down. 

I am in horrible shape. I smoke nonstop now. But I think I'm done. Treating my surroundings like trash. Being humiliated by my filth sadness and broke-ness. Needing to drink to deal with the day which destroys my already scatter brained mind and turn me into some type of semi “There ghoul”  Jesus Christ what the fuck is wrong with me. 

 I don't know a single person as bad as I am. I'm selfish for carrying myself like this, exposing myself to the world like this. It's like I have no self respect or dignity. Obese, fucked up hair, creepy.

 My other neighbor literally heard my therapy session. He knows I'm an alcoholic with social anxiety. I overheard him telling his friend.

 Every time I drink, my life becomes worse. My therapist said to write this down and remember it but I choose to ignore his advice. “I want to be able to drink but I'm afraid I can't handle it” 

You can't even do the basics in life.  Either I change today after all of this or my life will literally be a dumpster fire until the day I die. I pray I get a job in Alabama I got shortlisted for, tIt would be the best paying job I ever had. if i dont get it the, trucker job. If the  Trucking job doesn't work out, I will reenlist.

Nobody cares about me at all. What is even the point.

I am autistic, and I am sick of this fucking curse. Every time I leave the house all I get is infantilisation or just absolute disdain. Glares fro stupid fucking ignorant asshole pricks who would likely opt to have me shot on the spot if they could.

Nothing ever is going to get better. It's just going to get worse. That is a certainty. What on earth is even the point.

1mbgl87,Feeling nothing,"I am a 27-year-old woman. I’ve been struggling with depression for at least 6 years. Two doctors diagnosed me and prescribed antidepressants, but for some reason I was afraid to take them. I kept hoping it would go away on its own because I thought like it wasn’t that bad...

I think it all started after years of stress, lack of sleep, and a poor diet during university. Something happened to my health tbh, I’m not exactly sure what but my blood tests got worse, my hormones went crazy, I lost my period, and my FT3 levels became very low.

Because of that, I was constantly sad and emotionally unstable. I often had thoughts about not wanting to live, and the only thing that kept me going was my family. I cried or screamed all the time, usually for no big reason, even during sensitive (for me) conversations. Everything made me anxious, my body reacted with huge stress and sweating over the smallest things.

Eventually, I found a doctor who decided to cfix my FT3 levels. I started taking synthetic T3 (Liothyronine), and my mental health improved a bit. I’m no longer as sensitive, I get angry anymore, I don’t cry, and I don’t get stressed as easily.

But now I’ve noticed something else, I don’t feel anything. Nothing. Empty. It’s like my emotions have been switched off. I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt happiness- that warm feeling in my heart. I don’t feel love or joy. I’ve completely lost my libido. I don’t react at all when a guy touches me, hugs me, or kisses me.

I’ve also become very distracted and unmotivated. I can’t focus on anything. I stay stuck in my comfort zone. My whole life I used to be ambitious (I’m an engineer in mathematics), and I had lots of hobbies. I could sit and focus on one task for hours. Now that’s gone. I feel like a mess.

I have no idea what happened to me or how to fix it. I really don’t want to lose more years of my life. I already feel like I’m years behind my friends and other people my age.

I realized that maybe I should start taking the right medication. I wonder if anyone here has gone through something similar, and what kind of medication helped. I’ve heard that some antidepressants can make this feeling of emptiness even worse, and that scares me. I am planning to go see a doctor but I also try to understand what is going on",1753710328.0,2025-07-28 13:45:28+00:00,3,2,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbgl87/feeling_nothing/

It's what I often feel and I can't always vent to someone when I don't even know how I want to get out of it. I don't know the reason why I feel depressed. So, I just accept it.

My appetite is low, I don't wanna eat anything. Just one meal is fine. I don't intend to harm myself but I don't think I can force myself to eat something. I'll be fine the next day.

Im realy socially akward and just cant seem to talk to people, so i feel like I'll be single and alone forever. I want an intimate relationship, but it just feels completely unobtainable with my extreme awkwardness. I can't hold a basic conversion with people, and its so much worse when it comes to women. I feel like iv missed out on what should have been the best years of my life,  and i wont get them back. Plus i wouldn't be good enough for someone anyway. The loneliness often gets to me, and the thing that's gets to me the most is not having memories to look back. No past relationships to reminisce about. I have friends who tell me about thier past experiences with relationships, and I just feel kinda.....   jealous.

I'm an only child and I've been thinking this things since 13.

Also she explained to me that now is not the time to think about things like that because we're financially unstable. My father is near to be bed ridden, he gas tinnitus and is almost completely deaf. My father and mother are not together anymore since my mom had cameback to her sences that my dad is toxic for our family. I understand tho why my father is like that, because he also came from a toxic family. I understand anyone who does wrong, I always try to. Even my bully's, I know that they pick on me because maybe they've heen abused or also bullied and want to assert dominance to feel secured for themselves. I don't want to go to school now, I have no real friends, I can't even find a partner or someone who will love me romantically cause I'm ugly.

moves for everybody else continues to move. I'm stuck

benefits (living in the uk) because she is really worried for me because I am expecting to get
another surgery or brace to fix my scoliosis but i felt like depression has fully consumed me

aunts, cousins etc. worries about me a lot which I understand as I was born with many
disabilities but I feel like not trying anymore because nobody expects anything for me, I
haven’t drawn since I left school. I tried again this year and I feel nothing for it anymore or
anything. I always dream about ending myself but I feel scared and embarrassed to do so. I

Im a photographer and since I use my art to stablize my emotions I keep taking photos and try to socialize. Now in  small town I am known. I buy dresses for my models and I shoot them mostly for free. 

It is part of my healing process yet its also my impulsive buying part.  Everytime I buy even its cheap until the dress meets my criteria, I feel great fullfilment. Somehow it makes me want more. The feeling is like being free and making choices. And me making progress to my art, which are the things I cant make way back when I was diagnose with major depression.

Now, its not easy. Cause I still need to learn to slowdown. Cause I dont want to see my self fall back again. 

Maybe others have there own things that makes them free or excited. And whichever that is... hold unto it.

1mbf6jl,"Мне 18, и я не хочу больше существовать","впервые выскажу всё что копилось на душе годами, наверное глупо это делать здесь, но не думаю что кому-то из моих знакомых это надо. я родилась в достаточно бедной по сегодняшним меркам семье, не то чтобы у нас не было на еду, наоборот, всего необходимого в достатке, но что-то дорогое никогда не могли себе позволить, к примеру поездку на море даже в нашей стране. изначально в нашей семье кроме меня была бабушка и моя мама, отец умер через несколько месяцев после того как мне исполнился год. мама в скоре попала в аварию и стала инвалидом второй группы, ей приписали ревматоидный артрит из-за чего она постоянно нахрамывала, со временем от постоянного приема разных медикаментов её здоровье начало ухудшаться, камни в желчном, сердце, проблемы с желудком и печенью, катаракта на обоих глазах, да я даже не помню всего что у неё сейчас есть. но вернёмся к детству, по приходу в садик я поняла что как-то отличаюсь от остальных детей, которых приводили и забирали мама с папой, поскольку у меня это была только бабушка, на всех мероприятиях в дет.саде тоже была только она, я смотрела на других детей которые радовались при виде своих родителей и не понимала почему у меня не так, что со мной не так. несомненно я тоже радовалась когда видела бабушку, но это другое ощущение, ведь так? они радостно прыгали папе на руки, мама целовала их в щёку, а меня просто забирали, без всего этого. зимой после сада мы шли на остановку и ждали автобус часа полтора, когда было теплее туда и обратно добирались на велике. а приходя домой я видела маму скажем так, изуродованную. тело не могло выглядеть на её возраст, поэтому в 35 она выглядела на 50 и так далее. всегда завидовала детям у которых здоровые и красивые мамы, с которыми они могут побеситься или к примеру съездить куда нибудь. конечно у меня есть уважение к своей матери, но люблю ли я её? не думаю. время от времени меня могли бить если я сильно где-то напартачу, а если при этом я начинала плакать говорили не делать этого иначе ещё и за слёзы добавят. каждый вечер мама с бабушкой ссорились на кухне и каждый раз всё начиналось с ничего, каждый вечер они повторяли одни и те же фразы, настолько что я могу пересказать дословно все их ссоры. и вот мне 12, мы живём на минималку в Украине, в доме где не проведена вода и опадает глина с потолка оттого что крыша протекает и она размокает. я уже полностью поняла что моя семья отличается от всех остальных, я стыжусь своей матери и своих условий, не привожу домой друзей чтобы все думали что у меня всё так у других. я не выросла ребеноком паинькой, наоборот, если мне что-то запрещали, делала на зло та и вообще мои подростковые годы прошли в постоянном бунте, поскольку меня всегда опекали, если я задерживалась с друзьями на улице бабушка шла и забирала меня домой под предлогом что они переживают, при этом я гуляла в селе в нескольких домах от моего. после каждого такого раза я устраивала скандал, мол что я сама разберусь до скольки мне гулять. в школе у меня была подруга к которой я ездила на ночёвки и могла проводить там недели, я точно знала что её родители не против этого, поскольку она жила в селе где было пять домов и во всех были пенсионеры, они хотели чтобы их дочь проводила время с одногодками не только в школьные будни. мне могли звонить раз 50 за день, на что я просто отключала телефон, оттуда ведь она меня всё равно не заберёт поскольку не знает где это. а у этой подруги назовем её Лера были достаточно молодые родители, было то о чем я всегда мечтала и в те моменты когда я могла как-то по детски баловаться вместе с ней с её отцом были для меня чем-то новым, чем-то что приносит тепло и одновременно режет сердце. дома же после каждой такой поездки меня ждал грандиозный скандал, мать всегда говорила что она переживает, что ей плохо от этих переживаний, мол я хочу довести её до смерти. и когда-то в детстве я за что-то очень разозлилась на мать, когда она кричала на меня я в порыве гнева сказала ей «мне не нужна мать которая лазит» конечно это ударило по ней, услышать такое от своего ребенка это ужас. и вот почти каждый такой грандиозный скандал она напоминала мне об этом, несмотря на то что я тысячу раз извинилась за это, несмотря что прошло уже много лет, говорила что я наверняка хочу такую мать как у Леры и если так то я могу идти обратно туда, мне ничего не оставалось как всё отрицать, но она была права. позже Лера переехала в город и я тесно общалась с другой девочкой назовем её Диана. в то же время бабушка начала постепенно сходить с ума, сначала это было что-то мелкое, мол забыла куда положила деньги, телефон и всякие мелочи, постепенно это превращалось в забыла куда шла или же своё имя. у меня постоянно пропадали вещи которые она брала от чего я бесилась ещё сильнее, у неё была привычка перекладывать их либо же вообще выносить во двор в сарай, вроде бы ничего такого, но когда ты живёшь в постоянном хаосе, где не можешь элементарно найти свою одежду или предметы гигиены начинает действительно постепенно ехать крыша. мать же будто бы не понимала что бабушка психологически больна, она продолжала с ней ссориться, продолжала винить во всём меня или её. от постоянного какого-то стресса либо психологического давления я начинала быть всё агрессивнее, но что мать что бабушка могли сесть напротив меня и часами говорить обо мне всякий бред. мне бы было ещё нормально если бы не последнее, всю обиду и злость копившуюся во мне я могла выместить физически, разбить что-то или ударить их же, в эти моменты я будто себя не ощущала и не понимала что делаю. после этого приходя в себя я убегала куда-то подальше и ревела сожалея о содеянном. и всё же я нашла другой способ, я начала заниматься селфхармом. годы шли, порезов на мне было всё больше и больше, бабушке становилось всё хуже, она переставала узнавать меня, переставала понимать где находится, часто несла всякий бред будто она сейчас находится в больнице, а не в родном доме, могла пойти куда-то, по её словам домой после чего мне приходилось её искать и молиться чтобы меня никто не увидел рядом с ней, иногда могла быть агрессивной, взять нож и кричать чтобы мы её не трогали иначе зарежет. но мама и дядя (дочь и сын моей бабушки) будто игнорировали тот факт что ей нужно лечение, причем что у дяди были возможности свозить её хотя бы на осмотр. матери же нужно было куча операций, из них она сделала только две, большая часть денег и так уходила на её пожизненные лекарства без которых она не смогла бы двигаться. и вот мне 16 на тот момент я встречалась с парнем уже полтора года, даже впустила к себе домой и соответственно была уже не девственницей, я отдалась чтобы почувствовать себя нужной и любимой. и в этом возрасте происходит полностью переломный момент, бабушке резко становится хуже, она становится лежачей и ухаживать за ней приходится мне, она кричит целыми днями и ночами о смерти, мне приходится убирать естественные отходы иногда поднимать её на постель если она с неё падала. мы с мамой не могли есть и спать поскольку в этом ритме с постоянными криками спать было невозможно и сил чтобы даже встать с кровати не было. бабушке начали давать снотворные, но даже самые сильные помогали лишь на несколько часов после чего всё начиналось заново, в доме стоял резкий запах, хоть я и вымывала всё, полностью вывести его было невозможно, иногда мне приходилось через силу готовить для нас, хоть я уже сама понемногу сходила с ума, мне 16 и на мне два инвалида, это правда страшно. дядя же не хотел её забирать или же как-то помочь мне, он только делал вид что переживает, иногда привозил лекарства и проведывал бабушку говоря что я плохая хозяйка. мне же эти три часа сна снились только кошмары, начало что-то казаться в темноте, но об этом я никому не говорила, вдруг в психушку отправят. я жаловалась своему парню на что он пытался как-то меня подбодрить, но я достаточно распробовала вкус жизни и говорила ему что всё что он говорит не работает и такого не будет, на что он злился и говорил мне заткнуться тогда раз мне не нравится как он меня поддерживает, после таких пару раз я и вправду перестала говорить о своих проблемах так же приняла решение расстаться. и вот когда стало уже совсем невыносимо дядя положил бабушку в больницу где ухаживают за такими, я наконец-то смогла поспать, вымыла всё до блеска. тут приехал парень с цветами, конфетами и всякой ерундой, я решила дать ему шанс только из-за того что он как-то постарался для этого. через пару дней бабушка умерла, я была настолько разбита что помню смутно те дни, похороны, я ссорюсь с дядей из-за того что не хочу быть в одном доме с трупом родного человека, угрожал что убьет как увидит меня и всё в этом роде, на самих же похоронах я ревела навзрыд, это было ужасно. вечером же пришел мой парень, мы помянули и легли спать. в ту же ночь он начал приставать ко мне в том смысле в котором вы подумали, мне стало до тошноты противно от него, от всех его действий. в то время я очень похудела, можно было изучать биологию прямо по моему телу, он говорил что ему не нравится моё тело и он меня не хочет. в то же время я общалась с парнем сестры, (внучка дяди) сёстрами мы друг друга для удобства называем поскольку мы одного возраста. он был мне по душе, как-то уж сильно мы понимали друг друга, но сестра назовем её Маша очень ревновала его ко мне, на что я ей много раз говорила «давай я прекращу с ним общение» но она устраивала истерики потому что я была единственным его другом и Маша не хотела чтобы он меня лишился по её вине. со временем я начала понимать что влюбляюсь в парня Маши, оставила это в секрете от всех и рассталась со своим. на следующий же день после похорон слегла моя мать, она тоже стала лежачей и мне тоже приходилось ухаживать за ней, иногда даже подтирать ей зад, как бы противно это не звучало. ещё не успев отойти от смерти бабушки и всего что было мне приходилось готовить маме есть, но готовить ей нужно было по определённой диете из-за болезни желудка. поэтому готовила я почти что только ей, на себя сил не хватало. мне приходилось держать быт, ездить за продуктами и успевать учиться, к слову о учёбе, я забросила её в шестом классе, а в тот год меня чуть не отчислили потому что я не заходила ни на одну пару. маму то ложили в больницу, то выписывали и так продолжалось несколько месяцев. пока она лежала в больнице мне приходилось жить у дяди с тетей, и каждый день ездить к себе домой, тетя же недолюбливала меня и всю нашу семью, но почему-то видно это было только мне. Маша с назовем её парня Даня, ссорились каждый день и бывало по нескольку раз, она приходила ко мне за советами когда у меня и моих проблем было достаточно, но тем не менее я хотя бы отвлекалась так. в один день тетя сказала Маше что думает что Даня изменяет ей со мной, у меня хоть и была симпатия, но я не посмела бы так поступить. а Маша была из тех кто все свои секреты и личные дела рассказывает своим родным иногда выдавая мои и секреты Дианы из-за чего мы могли повздорить. Маша поверила тете и налетела с этим всем на меня, но мне было нечего скрывать, но всё же в конечном итоге они расстались, Даня признался мне и мне было нечего терять я тоже рассказала всё, позже мы начали встречаться, хоть это было и плохо по отношению к Маше, но почему я должна отказывать себе если им вместе не быть точно? Маша должна была понять меня, но этого не случилось, вся семья настроилась против меня, дядя который должен был взять опеку надо мной после бабушки отказался от этого назвав меня шлюхой, почему-то все уверены что я встречалась с ним за спиной Маши, может со стороны и выглядит всё это странно и быстро, но хотя бы сама Маша должна понимать что это не так, она ведь видела всё происходящее, но все факты она отрицает. из-за этой ситуации меня чуть не отправили в дет дом, оставили только для того чтобы я ухаживала за матерью, что я делаю и по сей день. мне страшно за моё будущее поскольку я даже не учусь, мне больно от всего пережитого и того что я переживаю сейчас, я не хочу больше ничего чувствовать, не хочу больше ничего видеть. я безумно устала, хочу свободно гулять и беззаботно жить как и все в моём возрасте, но к сожалению у меня нету такой возможности. если вы прочитали всё это до конца, оставьте пожалуйста хоть какой-то совет. в любом случае спасибо за то что читали и прожили вместе со мной немного моих воспоминаний.

1mbezqc,should i kms?,"(im not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this ive never used reddit sry)
i guess i should start this by saying i am slightly scared of death, i was researching ways to kms and the only painless thing i have to do it is nyquil which apparently i need to take 50 pills for it to even get close to killing me. ive been depressed since i think the start of 8th grade. but getting to the point i am currently 51 🔄, and ive lived all my life in the US. I um made some pretty shitty choices like smoking and drinking and all that so as a consequence for my actions, my parents have decided to force me and my sister to move to lebanon probably forever. i dont do very well with change and its really been freaking me out im not gonna lie (i think its also important to mention my dad is an emotional unavailable alcoholic who doesnt believe in “depression” and my mom is a narcissist. they’ve both abused me both physically and mentally alot of my life) the thing is, my boyfriend is telling me it’ll be okay and in 3 years i can just leave because my family has the money. but i kind of dont wanna wait 3 years for a “happy” future that isnt even promised. i kinda just want it to be over. i feel sorta bad for my boyfriend because he doesn’t really deserve to be dating a suicidal wreck. anyways back to the main topic, i cant see myself living here for 3 years. im not sure why, maybe its because im stubborn or maybe its my hatred towards change but my parents wont budge. ive begged and cried multiple times and they honestly dgaf and say its to “protect me” they also really hate my boyfriend (bc theyre racist as all arab parents are) and they keep saying the only reason i want to go back is to see him, which isnt the case. so me being forced to live here seems like a punishment to me. but in all honesty, i just want my life to be over. no matter where i am ill be miserable but i know i wont be any better here. i know the morally correct thing is to say “dont do it!!” but honestly, why not?",1753706171.0,2025-07-28 12:36:11+00:00,2,5,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbezqc/should_i_kms/

Lack of motivation or desire to have any goals for life, just going though the motions.

Its difficult to find true joy in any activity, I eventually feel exhausted, no matter the activity.

1mbezhj,Every Relationship feels transactional,"People are just there until you serve them good and when it is over, they simply just vanish. 

People say that parental love is the most superior but the same parent doesn't even think twice to abandon their children when their dreams around their children are shattered or the parents and children goals and dreams don't align- or the worst, you remain dependent on them when unemployed.

Institution of marriage and love often feels like a business contract- it's easy to break someone's heart, cheat on someone, have sex with strangers behind their partner's back, leave their partner after having child.

You know that one person that just sucks? You don’t have any ill will for them, they just suck, nobody likes them, nobody wants them around, they’re annoying, or stupid, or ugly, or worthless, you don’t want to deal with them as they bring no value to yours or anyone else’s life. They’re sweet and everything, generally well intentioned, just worthless, so it’s not like you want them dead. Luckily most of the time they’re blissfully unaware of it, and everyone is at least cordial to them as to not hurt their feelings.

Yeah I’m sure you’ve met or known one or two them in your life. Now imagine that it’s you, and you’re painfully aware of it.

This has been going on for a lot of time, probably since the first time I masturbated, but the link has been clear only lately.. I had an amazing month, I masturbated one time and I got suicidal back again. I found out that with porn is worse, but it's bad even without it. With sex sometimes is fine, usually is not.

I think it can be tied to PTSD? Pheraps sexual trauma I don't remember? I have definitely abandonment trauma tho.
I can't really enjoy my sexuality most of the times. Sometimes it is fine, but most of the times it is like that..

1mbbs0d,The struggle of depression,"Note: just a quick glance and most of the posts are off-ing, btw this is not that. This is just some hopefully relatable talk about dealing with having depression.

I know I’m not the first to admit that having depression is the one of the worst things ever. It’s impossible to deal with at times and makes you reminisce about when you were younger and “happier”. My depression is genetic (shout out to my mom who didn’t mean to pass it on and is the strongest person I know because she has way worse shit that she herself deals with). Nothing super bad has scarred me into being the person I am today. Everyday just feels like shit and there’s no reason for it. I have no idea if my medication is even doing anything and therapy just isn’t hitting like it used to. 
I’m just sick of feeling so bad all the time (not implying off-ing), but I want to live. I like when good things happen and I always thing about them. But it just seems like those good times are just so few and far between the more days go by. Feeling crappy feels crappy and it’s okay to feel like that but it’s impossible to live with.
I guess one thing I can say is my wisdom teeth are coming in so I see a dentist tomorrow. I don’t think I’ve brushed my teeth in two years, only here and there when I’m feeling kinda good. But I always wear my retainers and I feel good about that. My depression really kicks me down in the personal hygiene department. My showers are spaced far apart and I feel crappy for it but I can’t help it. 
Being comfortable in ur own misery is so dangerous because it’s so easy when you are suffering from depression. Watch 14 hours of YouTube a day, eat whenever you need or want to and sleep all day, it feels crappy. Yeah my meds probably aren’t working tbh or it’s just pms (yes I have a coochie). 
At least I got my reasons to be happy and my reasons to be proud: I drink water all throughout the day like people should, I wear my retainers every night, I take care of my dogs (honestly more then myself), I have a conscience and feel empathy for people, I love my family and they like me, I am good with my money and barley spend any, when I’m at work I put my heart and soul into it (point of it getting unhealthy but hey I’m working on it), I haven’t done drugs and haven’t ever drunk alcohol (underage), I did well in school and proud of how I ended things, I’m learning to like myself again and I feel proud of all the work I’ve done. 
I want to live better but it’s hard a lot of the time. There used to be a lot of guilt with my depression affecting me so bad but I’m learning to accept that one thing can affect people in all different types of ways. But hey, I can only take it one day at a time. ",1753695597.0,2025-07-28 09:39:57+00:00,1,1,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbbs0d/the_struggle_of_depression/

1mbb521,Not sure why I'm posting this...,"I think I'm posting this just to get it off my chest!

I've been suffering with depression for literally years, but I've just been lying to myself, my friends and my family about it by putting on a brave face. These days I don't. I just tell it like it is.

I use to be extremely outgoing, active, motivated. I'm a musician, so I enjoyed playing, writing, creating and recording music. As well as gigging and going to gigs. 

But these days, I have lost all interest in music. I don't even listen to it. I don't really enjoy doing any of the things that I use to. This even comes down to simple things like gaming or even watching movies and TV. I just can't be bothered to do even that. I'd rather just sit and do nothing. 

For someone who was extremely active, and loved to travel, getting through the day is a slog.

Alcohol amplifies my mood, and I become unbearable to be around.

I hate feeling like this. Depression is such a awful thing. And it's really hard to get out of it.

And for people that don't have it, it's really hard to explain to them what it feels like. ",1753693163.0,2025-07-28 08:59:23+00:00,2,1,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbb521/not_sure_why_im_posting_this/

I don’t even feel real anymore. 

I’m 31 one now, and I’ve been dealing with major depressive disorder for over 10 years now. I’ve had multiple therapists give up on me, my psychiatrist doesn’t know what to do anymore. I wish we were further along in treatment for depression as a society. 

I used to be such a motivated, happy person. Everything that makes a human being a human being, has been stripped from me. I haven’t felt an emotion in years. I’m just blank. A void.

1mbatv2,Is it too much to ask for a plate of rice?,"what im feeling:

feeling like a loser, feeling like I've lost in life. I open linkedin and all I see is how are people who were once thrown out of the class for scoring less or the ones who asked me to help them with their assignments are now sorted in life, happy with their IT jobs. Where did I go wrong? I'm sure even they didn't want to take up IT as their career but they did and they are doing it and getting paid 20k-30k and here I am with 5k, and that too this month I wont get that too. I thought December was far but its just 4 months away.

With the amount of leaves ive taken I don't think ill be converted to a full time employee. and neither do I care, why? because this is not what I want to do. what do I want to do? I DONT KNOW. I know every job brings its own level of stress and this is not the type of stress I want or I can handle. I want to do something that comes naturally to me. But what can I do Naturally? drawing? helping? im not an expert in both and neither there is a career associated with both. Tired of being treated as a responsibility, tired of being a burden, tired of not getting what I want and tired of being asked to be grateful with what I have. Let's say, a person is dying of hunger and has a grain of rice; what he wants is a fist full of rice. He's not asking for more, just wants what will satisfy him for now, and with the energy he gets with it, he can do some petty work and then earn and then he can slowly afford for a plateful of rice. But right now, all he has is a grain of rice and he's asked to be grateful for it. Sometimes, something is not better than nothing; something is EQUAL to nothing.

And that's what I have, nothing. A boy loves me and I pity him. I don't see what he sees in me. and that's the point right? If I dont see the capacity in myself, how will I ever be able to do what I like?

Also, what do I like? WHAT is it? I have dreams but they are something I want to happen, not achieve. Getting married to the love of my life, slow mornings with him, treating him with love and care and being treated the same. This is my dream. I do not have any career oriented dream because I never thought of career as the most important thing in life. For me, the only thing that mattered in life is love. Not just in my partner but everywhere in the world. Maybe this is where I went wrong. But such a big punishment for this that I had to change 3 jobs in 1 year along with 5 months of being unemployed? The more I say this, the more disoriented I feel. I cant believe that this is happening to ME. I want to fight this but it is not the right time to give swimming lessons to a person while they are drowning. I just want some time to figure out what I like. I dont think my family will ever understand me for this. Being fed, given shelter, provided education because its their responsibility and not out of love. How can others have right on our time? Why do parents have to show others that they have their children(in my early 20's btw) under their control by yelling and screaming at them in family functions? Why do parents expect their children to use their brains for studies and not for personal decisions?

Is it too much to ask for? Or is it not?

Is it a plateful of rice? Or a grain of rice?

Nothing interests me anymore except changing the way I feel with substances. I can’t remember the last time I felt a genuine moment of joy. I can’t take care of myself anymore. I don’t look forward to anything, and my days are consumed by simply fighting to keep my head above water and keeping up appearances in which I pretend everything is going fine.

This dark cloud above my head is relentless. I tried fighting it for a while, but now, I think it has won the battle.

1mb9uig,"It doesn't hurt, and it doesn't feel, am I still alive?","I remember when I still worried about ""getting hurt"" or ""your actions have consequences"" I can't describe what I feel in direct words, so I appreciate the time to ramble.

I've gone through the phase of crying until I was tired, of getting used to my own loneliness, of never feeling happy at any moment and of being seen as someone useless, inefficient and who only pretends to be normal. After all this I realize that it wasn't worth the effort, just the purest sadness and melancholy, but I like to feel melancholy, it makes me happy, it's so contradictory, you know? I like this feeling, the melancholy, being so DESTROYED in depression balances the scales, I still hate every single moment I'm alive and I hate myself for not being able to get better, even more because I try, every day, I still want to die, every day, but it seems tiring to even try again.

I remember when I wrote the first letter to my mother, the second and third didn't make her understand me, when I was at the window on the thirteenth floor and on top of a bridge I think she finally understood that ""hah, my son wasn't playing!"", I like the support she gives me, no, actually I hate it, she seems to try and help, but I can't stand going to another shitty job interview when I quit the last 3 I was on when I realized I WOULD KILL MYSELF JUST FOR THE INSURANCE at the first opportunity, just to go away without feeling guilty, Or feeling even more than you should.

I'd love to give a motivational message of ""it gets better"" but I live with the constant awareness of ""it hasn't gotten better, it's just become tolerable."", then I say it will become tolerable at best.

I wanted to feel anything besides this hellish sadness, anything. Any pleasure. Any pain, any madness, anything, even disgust would be something pleasurable, I don't know if anyone will understand this here because honestly? I'm just writing to vent because my wife doesn't understand that ""I might not be alive today"" is a cry for help and not a joke, I'd love to talk to someone as devastated as I am, but there's a 50% chance they're already on the ropes turning into gore content on an obscure website.

But with the remaining 50% chance, where you didn't ignore it, can I just ask if you can feel happy? What makes you happy? Could I be happy again without doping myself until I forget my name?",1753687971.0,2025-07-28 07:32:51+00:00,2,2,depression,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb9uig/it_doesnt_hurt_and_it_doesnt_feel_am_i_still_alive/

1mb9c51,This one hurt.,"I’ve been struggling a lot. I cry constantly, sometimes collapse on the floor, and always feel sad. I told my parents that I don’t know what’s wrong with me. They said it’s because I’ve been stuck at home for the past two years. But the real reason is that I was assaulted last year (the person said it was unintentional), and ever since then, I haven’t been in the right state of mind. I cry all the time and get angry so easily.

I begged my parents to get me help, and after a lot of convincing, they finally agreed. They took me to a psychiatrist yesterday, and I was diagnosed with depression. They prescribed me medication. I thought this would make my parents understand why I’ve been acting the way I am. But I was wrong.

Later, I was on a call with my sister, crying, and she was apologizing for not noticing what I was going through sooner. My mother saw me crying and started shouting at me, saying I was bothering my sister and that she already had too much work to deal with.

That made me cry even more, so I went to the one person I usually feel safest with, my father. But he also got angry and said things like, “Why are you crying again? Don’t you get it? It hurts me so much to see you in pain. What do you even lack? Everyone loves you, try to be grateful. If I ever see you crying again, I won’t talk to you anymore. You’ve stressed everyone out. We all try to keep you happy. I’m a heart patient when I see you crying, it shocks me. If something happens to me, you’ll be responsible. I’m warning you, if you cry again, I won’t speak to you.”

Hearing that made me want to die. I felt like I’m only causing pain to everyone around me. I just wanted the ground to swallow me whole.

Then my mother came and said, “You’ve stressed out my husband so much,” and started yelling at me again even about little things like not picking up the dishes. She kept repeating, “You’ve stressed out my husband.” I love my dad more than I love myself, so hearing this was killing me.

She even got angry at me for crying to my sister. She told me, “if I ever see you crying again, it won’t be good for you. Go to sleep quickly, or I’ll take your phone.” I told her, “Mama, I can’t sleep. I try, but I just can’t.” And she said, “You’re not trying hard enough.”

Now I feel like I have to suppress my emotions completely. I can’t say anything to anyone. I feel like I have no one left.

1mb8xyy,"I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be alive","I have a loving wonderful family, each one of them exists as if they’re born for excellence. Im the youngest of 3 kids. My sister got a job hella young and she’s been paying for basically all her stuff (besides housing) since then. She’s a gym girl and she’s insanely hard working. She’s had to overcome addiction, a broken spine, and a lot of heartbreak. My brother is an actual genius, the kid that shows up to the class day of the test after teaching himself the math at 4 AM the previous night and gets the highest grade and codes face recognition turrets for the funsies. Not to mention he’s the funniest and most emotionally open person you’d ever meet. He has a way to make you feel seen and understood with just a few words. He knows exactly what would make him happiest in the moment and then he just.. does that thing?? (🤯)

He bought a hammock the other day and just invited a friend to hammock at the park with him. He said “I realized there’s nothing I wanted more in the world to just sit in a hammock at the park with a friend so I did :)” he sent a photo and I thought, “this is the most beautiful thing in the world. To live with your desires fully realized like this.”

My mom has had the hardest life you could think of. Like, testify against her father before the age of 14 and work her way through college with 2 newborns and a mom with cancer. My dad is the most supportive person I know, he gets my hobbies and we jam to the Beatles when we have time. I love them. I love them so much. 

I feel like I don’t compare to them at all. I never measure up no matter how I cut it. The thing is, I am also usually the best at the things I do as well. I’m social and supportive and creative. I don’t hate myself. Well not all the time, I guess. But if I have so much merit, why can’t I do anything with it? Why can’t I win this mental war with myself every time I need to clean my room, or go on a walk, or change my clothes in the last 4 days? I see people with way less doing way more and it’s a little fucked to say that I envy whatever they have that makes them want to.. exist? Breathe? Not pray to a god they don’t believe in, begging not wake up in the morning? 

I’ve had people tell me I’m incredible, I’m funny, I’m talented, and I’m pretty. It’s not even that I don’t believe them. But I hate the compliments because the person I don’t measure up to the most is myself. I’m always failing me. So much so I feel like I’m stagnating in this open ocean and I’m just so tired of swimming just enough to keep my head above water. 

I’m not gonna kill myself. I’ve never even self harmed besides some impulsive eating habits and reckless social behavior which I wouldn’t consider self harm but the line’s fuzzy I guess. I’ve hated pain all my life. Made me terrified to fail so I stopped trying. I’m slowly making efforts to break out of that mindset. 

I’m just so tired. I’m just so damn tired of these waves of emptiness. This Everest I have to climb any time there’s a problem that would come off as a slight inconvenience for an average person. I don’t even cry anymore. I just waste away. 

I’ve let friendships wither because I’ve been scared to let them down when I can’t be the person I built myself up to be. I’ve never committed to any relationship, and I’ve never committed to the life I *know* I could have if I could just… 

I don’t know. Just be alive. Feel the way I feel at a park watching a lil kid walk a much bigger dog (and fall over and get dragged when the dog sees another dog, that was funny) with their parents.

1mb8x8i,I'd love someone to talk to,"I(35f) went trough a pretty bad relationship with my ex(34f). She was scared I would do anything with anyone, so I ended one friendship after another, until I've had her and her friends and family left.
We have got two kids, living with me. Since the 1st one was born I stayed at home a lot more, allowing my ex to go to all kinds of events with her friends. Makes sense, I've got noone to go out with, so why should I? 
Over the years I felt much more lonely, unloved and somewhat unnecessary overall. I tryed to talk to her, but she never was good in takeing criticism and takeing feelings of other people in consideration.
Ending the relationship was the hardest decision I've made so far. A bad one, as it shows. She endet up in a mental health clinic, after atemted suicide. That was the point let the last of my contacts go and focus solely on her mental health, our little family and maybe things will be alright.
Things were alright, we were closer than before, I felt loved. Another 5 years, not officially in a relationship, but doing all the couple things, except holding hands.
I still could'nt go anywhere or had any friends and I developed a social anxiety, but I felt fine.
Now she saied she's moved on, she has a new one. 
Now I'm left with two kids. Kids wich don't need to know of my emotional distress and lonelyness.
There are nö grandparents from my side btw, mom died 22 years ago, wich made my dad a rageing, abusive alcoholic.

If someone came that far, thank you for at least reading whats on my mind right now.
I'd love someone to talk to every now and then. Maybe more offen.. I'm socialy rusty",1753684447.0,2025-07-28 06:34:07+00:00,4,3,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb8x8i/id_love_someone_to_talk_to/

1mb8osm,Numb,"       Her eyes were a swirling grey cosmos that enraptured me. I could not break my gaze even if I wanted to. She had taken the form of the very thing I yearned for. A woman i had fallen hard for in my younger days. Hair long black and sleek. The body color olive. She raised her arms as if to embrace me. Already I could feel the warm embrace. The numbness I would expect to soon follow.
        ""NO!!"" I turned my head slightly to see who would talk during such a tender moment. Then I saw her again. Her warm brown eyes with tears running down her tender face.
        ""I can't...."" as I begin to feel warm... then numb.

1mb85po,Life has made a sudden turn for the better!,"So just a summary of the past three years, my step-father blew his brains out, I had to clean it up, became an alcoholic, my fiance left me, moved to another state, hate the people, hated every job, spiraled to the bottom, saw a therapist and doctor, got Prozac and sleeping pills, feeling better, got a job I actually like. Fuck. ""You must be this low to ride this ride"" would be the name of this chapter. 

But! After three weeks on Prozac and being able to sleep without alcohol, it has done immeasurable good for my mental health. I think the Prozac will take a few weeks more, but just being able to sleep has done wonders for my mental health. Alcoholism is a beast. I self medicated to stave off insomnia. After four days without sleep, things get bad. And not having health insurance, I figured seeing a doctor was out of my reach. Everything costs about $500 (doctors visit, Prozac, anti drinking magic pills, and sleeping stuff (I won't go into details)). 

If your in the same situation I was (still am) in, the best thing you can do is see a doctor. Explain your situation and don't hold back. Tell them everything. Lying will only do you harm. 

Anyway, that's not the point I'm trying to make. 

I just got a job that I love! It's not the sort of job people aspire to. In fact, if you told me five years ago that I'd be ecstatic about stocking milk, I probably would have shot myself.

I've worked in the service industry for most of my life. And anyone who has done so knows how soul crushing it can be. Day after day, shitty, narcissistic customers, drug addled coworkers... the list goes on. 

But now my job is to put gallons of milk on a shelf. There are a few other minor things I have to do, but that's basically it! I'm alone in a giant walk-in, with nothing but my thoughts or an audiobook, and I couldn't be happier. I'm surrounded by giant fans so whatever noise I make is drowned out! I'm experimenting with all my voices, making up stories, singing, dancing! I do stand up comedy, and this is the perfect space for me to practice and create. I never would have thought this job would bring me such joy.

To close, here's a story about a Farmer and his son:

One day in late summer, an old farmer was working in his field with his old sick horse. The farmer felt compassion for the horse and desired to lift its burden. So he left his horse loose to go the mountains and live out the rest of its life.

Soon after, neighbors from the nearby village visited, offering their condolences and said, ""What a shame.  Now your only horse is gone.  How unfortunate you are!. You must be very sad. How will you live, work the land, and prosper?"" The farmer replied: ""Who knows? We shall see"".

Two days later the old horse came back now rejuvenated after meandering in the mountainsides while eating the wild grasses. He came back with twelve new younger and healthy horses which followed the old horse into the corral.

Word got out in the village of the old farmer's good fortune and it wasn't long before people stopped by to congratulate the farmer on his good luck.  ""How fortunate you are!"" they exclaimed. You must be very happy!""  Again, the farmer softly said, ""Who knows? We shall see.""

At daybreak on the next morning, the farmer's only son set off to attempt to train the new wild horses, but the farmer's son was thrown to the ground and broke his leg.  One by one villagers arrived during the day to bemoan the farmer's latest misfortune.  ""Oh, what a tragedy!  Your son won't be able to help you farm with a broken leg. You'll have to do all the work yourself, How will you survive? You must be very sad"".  they said.  Calmly going about his usual business the farmer answered, ""Who knows? We shall see""

Several days later a war broke out. The Emperor's men arrived in the village demanding that young men come with them to be conscripted into the Emperor's army.  As it happened the farmer's son was deemed unfit because of his broken leg.  ""What very good fortune you have!!"" the villagers exclaimed as their own young sons were marched away. ""You must be very happy."" ""Who knows? We shall see!"", replied the old farmer as he headed off to work his field alone.

As time went on the broken leg healed but the son was left with a slight limp. Again the neighbors came to pay their condolences. ""Oh what bad luck. Too bad for you""!  But the old farmer simply replied; ""Who knows? We shall see.""

As it turned out the other young village boys had died in the war and the old farmer and his son were the only able bodied men capable of working the village lands. The old farmer became wealthy and was very generous to the villagers. They said: ""Oh how fortunate we are, you must be very happy"", to which the old farmer replied, ""Who knows? We shall see!""

Life is a lot. Am I happy? Fuck no. But I'm happy about some things. I'm still healing, and fighting depression will always be a part of my life, but there is something worth fighting for, even if we can't see it. Take care of your broken selves for the person you'll be tomorrow.

1mb7wrd,Is my suicide selfish?,"Is planning my suicide so illogical and selfish?

No, I don't want to encourage anyone to do that, so before you read my comment, I ask that you don't take it as an encouragement if you work along those lines.

Anyway, despite being a Christian (if I can call myself that), I'm becoming more and more familiar with this idea.

I've been very depressed about life for many years.

Depressed about myself, because I'm a failure of a man.

Depressed about society, because everywhere I look, I see pain, destruction, promiscuity, and liquid people.

There's no longer the search for and debate about true love, romantic or otherwise.

We're increasingly selfish, increasingly destructive, and increasingly liquid.

Not to mention the constant urgency we live in. I'm so psychologically screwed that nothing gives me pleasure, nothing surprises me.

It used to be incredibly pleasurable to wait 24 hours for another episode of a cool show on network TV. You felt such satisfaction when the time came.

Now, I can't wait for the ad to end so I can skip to the next episode.

I don't know. I'm very confused by a pain that never leaves my chest. I've been carrying this for over ten years.

So, I'm increasingly convinced to plan for the big day. I'd like to do something useful beforehand, leave money for family and friends, do something that helps other people who aren't family, and finally, die.

I've already accepted that I'm going to hell. I'm just unsure how to leave. I've always imagined myself dying like a hero.

Like something out of a movie, covered in blood after performing a heroic act, like killing some bad guys while protecting a child or something like that.

What do you say? Is it selfish to act like this?",1753680659.0,2025-07-28 05:30:59+00:00,2,2,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb7wrd/is_my_suicide_selfish/

I think it just hit me really hard finally finding something I've wanted my entire life then its gone. I had a really isolated abusive childhood so I know this hits on a lot of past trauma. 

I spiraled into what felt like s nervous breakdown last week. Crying almost all day/night, couldn't eat or sleep, had headaches, digestive issues. I wanted to kill myself so bad and felt hopeless. My work best friend talked to me about it. I told him I didn't feel like I'd be ok. I've never felt so depressed and over everything. He says I'm not ok, but I'll be fine.

Now the past few days I've just felt empty/numb with sadness hanging in the background.

any advice for someone who is struggling and needs help, but the mental health services in their country are notoriously atrocious? Is there an international mental health outreach that can be contacted? I'm in EU.

I've struggled with depression for many years and have reached out many times, even been hospitalized once, but regretted seeking help every time due to how poorly I was treated.

Now my depression's getting worse again. I feel like the walls are closing in on me and there's nothing but darkness, but I would rather end things than subject myself to the mistreatment again.

1mb70jg,I have no reason,"19f about to start college- for some reason I genuinely am not excited about it. It sounds more like a busy dread- like high school but without the social part and with more responsibilities… great. 

I have classes and a major picked out which is cool and all but what exactly does that get me?? Like.. why would I enjoy anything? What would I enjoy? 

I’m lonely but honestly trying to find and create friendships is not something I want to do- and will avoid doing, because they are never ideal or worth the trouble. What do I get out of it? I’ve gotten leeches who suck my money and constantly ask for food, I’ve gotten liars and I’ve always settled for these people because- wait.. this is apparently not supposed to be how people act?? Like people actually do activities with each other? Not even my parents have done that stuff for me- at least not while I was am an adult lol. 

The realization that my relationships were not “normal” or maybe they are and people are lying? - made me realize I genuinely don’t want to try. I’m done making an effort, I’m done wasting time and energy, and I’m sick of my friendships being so burdensome rather than actually making me happy or interested. It IS and has been a chore I dread, and now that I have more and more things piling up that I dread and every ounce or “hope” or “excitement” is pretty much gone (reality has set in)- I’ve devoted my goal to finding a permanent solution. 

That’s about it. Also I am not interested in online friendships. They don’t interest me. Texting strangers with intentions that I do not know on Reddit is not fulfilling, sorry.

I remember everyday that I would tell everyone that I was fine if they asked if I was ok. Eventually I lost touch with what feeling or emotion even was, I felt no joy, no excitement, no sadness, it was a completely cold silence. It all changed when I met who would be my best friend, he was always there for me and slowly it got better, I remember the first day I was able to truly smile and it broke me. Two months ago I lost him to a od, the same thing I had been using to escape years prior, and something I was trying to help him fight took the only person I was able to truly care about and be alive around. I have no idea how I am supposed to grieve. I went to his funeral and didn’t feel a thing, just sat there cold and dead, there was even the smallest spark of what I should be feeling. I’ve been throwing myself into work, working 70+ hours just to not give myself time to even think about it, i relapsed bad, I was thinking just maybe it would bring me closer to him, maybe I’d be lucky enough to go see him. Today I broke, I took my bike and started riding, every semi or bend I looked at seemed like a great place to do it. Every time I made up my mind and was about to do it felt like something was pulling me away and I just couldn’t do it. Now I’m laying in bed at a hotel almost 15 hours away from home and I just don’t know if I should go back at all.

1mavkn4,Currently experiencing the worst depressive episode of my life,"I don’t know why I posted here, reading other people’s posts really made me feel like I’m not so alone and I have been feeling this way for a long time. 

I’m 27 and spent most of my 20s trying to get myself to university, when I finally got there last year. The first 5/6 months were amazing, like I’d finally gotten the fresh start I’d always dreamt of. I lived with new friends in a new place and felt like all the previous struggles with my mental health had finally got me to a good place. My nervous system was at peace, I could sleep better at night, I had a person who loved me in my life and I had amazing friends around me. 

As soon as 2025 came around, things have seemed to spiral completely. My ex left me for my friend, all my remaining friends have decided to move on for their partners or their family, my grandmother died and all of my financial resources have completely dried up. My university accommodation has kicked me out because I can’t afford the rent, resulting in me currently sleeping on my mum’s sofa with no other options. I have to drop out of the course I worked so hard to study just so I can be entitled to some government support regarding finances and housing. 

I’ve gotten to the point now where I don’t want to wake up and I don’t want to be here anymore. My world has crashed down around me and I have no real support to get through it. My friends don’t care anymore, I can tell my mum is sick of me crying all the time and being so upset. I feel sick every second of the day, I can’t even eat anything. I never have anyone to talk to, I wake up every day with no notifications from anybody and it makes me feel so alone.  

I wonder if things are ever going to get better, or whether it’s just best to stop trying and give up for good. My mind is in a constant battle between “things might get better” and “nothing will ever get better” and it’s getting harder to fight 💔",1753645429.0,2025-07-27 19:43:49+00:00,1,0,depression,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mavkn4/currently_experiencing_the_worst_depressive/
1mb6rf9,Running low," Im 25f and I’ve been living with depression for as long as I can remember. I feel physically and mentally week all the time. It’s like im running on empty all the time. I’ve been through countless psychologists and psychiatrists. I’ve been involuntarily placed in mental hospitals. Hospitalized for intentional overdoses. And at this point idk what else to do. I really want to see life in a different way but i have to fake “good” emotions so much that life ends up feeling pointless and exhausting. 

I have a great partner who is trying his best to keep me up float but i can’t help but feel guilty for making him go through so many hard times with me because of my depression. I don’t do it on purpose but it’s so tiring to put a good face at work all day and then coming back home to continue faking a good mood. I have learned to tell people to ignore me when i stop acting happy because i feel like i am unsatisfiable, i just need moments to recharge and start faking emotions again. I truly believe that there is no amount of help i can get at this point to get me out of depression. 

At this point, it feels wrong to feel happy because i know that the emotion is only temporary.

One lasted a year til my dad couldn't take my mums shit, and the other was married for maybe 5-10 years. I dunno I was young, and the other one had never married.

1mb5yx6,I made a bad situation worse and living on GUILT AND SHAME EVERY SINGLE DAY!! I AM SOO LONELY,"I made a bad situation worse and now suffering everything because she wanted to be with me but I took the stupidest decision and regret it with GUILT and SHAME

I’ve been struggling with severe post-breakup depression. I had a loving, caring, and deeply supportive partner who stood by me through everything. But over the past six months, I’ve been drowning in pressure from every side. My parents constantly tell me, “We are not proud of you,” and, “We can’t speak highly of you.” Despite moments where I had stable finances, held jobs, and even gave them gifts phones, repairing their devices, and more they still made me feel worthless. They ignore how difficult the job market is right now. I’ve been applying tirelessly, attending interviews, and doing everything I can, but to them, it’s never enough. They assume I just don’t want to try.

Meanwhile, my partner was asking to get married and placing pressure on me, even though I kept reassuring her that I would do it the moment I had a stable income. I was always clear about my intentions. My parents were aware of the marriage situation but chose to avoid it. I tried multiple times to involve them, but they never made an effort to talk to her or even acknowledge the seriousness of the relationship.

Instead, they told me things like, “We want you to become successful, buy our flight tickets, and take us shopping when we visit.” That was their dream not my relationship, not my happiness. This added more pressure and caused daily arguments between my girlfriend and me. I was emotionally overwhelmed. Each day, I would get calls from home filled with blame and disappointment, followed by fights with the one person who used to be my peace. I had no strength left to argue or defend myself, so I just stayed silent and let her win every time.

Eventually, I shut down. I felt completely unheard, mentally drained, and frustrated. My emotions went numb. I couldn’t feel anything anymore. And in that numbness, I resorted to something I never imagined I would do I cheated. I had always been loyal. For six years, I never looked at anyone else. But in that moment of complete emotional breakdown, I made a terrible decision. I know it sucks and its unforgiving, but I still want her back. I know she won't come back, we did meet for 2 weeks after and I promised to change myself and behave well. 

The aftermath was even worse. The girl I had hooked up with started spreading horrible, false rumours about me. My own sister, who I thought would support me, laughed about the situation and made jokes to my partner, further destroying my image. My ex shared everything with our mutual friends and community. I was labelled “the ugliest guy,” “the worst ex,” and even told I looked like a “molester.”

Every day I carry immense guilt and shame. I can’t eat properly I take a few bites and feel like throwing up. I cry until my head aches, then fall asleep from exhaustion. I had a job interview recently, but I couldn’t even focus on it. I’ve become completely isolated. I don’t have friends I can talk to. I’m alone. I know I need professional help, but I simply cannot afford it.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about ending everything. I thought maybe if I drove really fast on an empty road without a seatbelt and crashed into something, it would be easier than trying to hang myself. I don’t feel like I have the strength to survive this anymore.",1753674106.0,2025-07-28 03:41:46+00:00,1,1,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb5yx6/i_made_a_bad_situation_worse_and_living_on_guilt/

1mb55k1,Finally making effort to move my life forward but I still feel nothing,"For years, I've been doing just enough to keep my head above water, but nothing more. Just living the same day, working the same job, barely saving any money, sleeping all my free time away. I never really aspired to be anything or do anything, I've been living just because. 

I finally decided this year that I was going to try to pick my life up and do something else. I started making an effort to save money, started actually making some plans for a future, started grasping at goals. Soon I will be moving to a different state and living away from my hometown for the first time while I try to pursue new opportunities.

On paper, it sounds exciting. But yet, I still just feel empty. Lonely. Like I'm still just living just because. I'm going to be doing things that should excite me, and yet, I still have these feelings as though I would rather not exist. I would rather not be doing any of this and just rest eternally. 

But I told myself earlier this year, if I was already thinking of doing something so drastic, why not try to drastically change up my life first? At least then I could say I tried before giving up.

I tried therapy for a few years, tried a few different medications. Nothing ever really helped. Sometimes I feel like I just don't like life on a fundamental level. But leaving also isn't easy. So I guess I'm left to just stick around and see what happens.

I'm not any crisis but I definitely think about things like even if my life does get better I have a boyfriend and a nice house and family eventually it we'll go back to darkness I'll dip back to this mindset cuz eventually even if it's a long time eventually I will lose everyone I love my future kids, life partner, my pets, my parents, my friends , or lose me that scary. And even if I live a great life eventually I'll be old, like most old people I'll be alone with a bunch of health issues and eating figgy pudding in a nursing home that doesn't respect me and ageism and people not taking you seriously when you're old.

Even people who are older than me say that it just goes downhill from here or life is shitty... But they're still here working and living whether it's for love, hobbies, rewards or whatever they have to have some sort of anchor to keep going. I have an anchor but it's flimsy and slowly going away if I don't have this anchor I don't know what else would anchor me in this world because everything just feels so absurd and not real sometimes like I'm just in a sick evil cosmic simulator or videogame I can't get out of.

I sat there wondering why I'm so ugly and rejected.  Why does nobody ever ask me to join them for a drink, coffee or dinner.  If someone does reach out randomly it's simply because the need something.  

I'm not worthy of anyone checking in on me asking me if I'm ok or if I need anything. I'm to ugly to have a partner in this life.

Therapy was too expensive,family isn’t supportive,no amount of walks/hobbies have been helpful & im just failing at everything else.

1mb2zxi,I am so lonely and invisible......,"I went to a close family friends funeral yesterday.  I grew up with him and his brothers.  He was only 59. He had a illustrious career in the US state dept and USAID.  he had an  incredible sense of humor.
And had been planning on moving back home and although he was dealing with some health issues i was looking forward to reconnecting. 

It really hit home how fucked up my life is. I have a partner but we dont have a good connection. We have lived together for over 13 years. Its complicated. 

Part of the complication is finances and i am so cash poor and in debt. I feel like an utter failure.  I sit alone at home (partner is at other property trying to fix it up... Long story)
Anyway i have pushed so hard this year... Despite being hit with bad back problems and an ankle problem.  

I have few to no friends. The friends i do have are iut of town. I call and leave messages and only one calls me back. 

I see all these people getting their lives together. Having fun. I have no money barely any gas even to get me to and from work. Our AC is out too broke to fix it. 

I care additionnally for 15 cats and used to have a benefactor who would give me 50 bucks to buy food and litter. All the shelters are full... And now we have 3 other cats we are feeding at the othe plaxe cause the neighbors just abandoned them. NO I AM NOT A CAT HOARDER!! 

Anyway.... Just feeling like what is the point. I have no energy or. Motivation to do anything. 
I have tried and still am stuck. 

Just needed to try and reach out cause well that is what folks say to do..... So i am doing it
. Honestly wish i had a way to painlessly leave this hell of a world.  Nothing here for me. I am 57 
... I have run my course and realise thst i am merely a NPC..... Standing in the background of life....

1mb2j5u,I’m tired,I'm tired. The kind of tired that sleep can not fix. The kind of tired where you have no choice but to put on a smile and fake your way through the day so no one worries about you. The kind of tired that eats away at you bit by bit until there's nothing left of you. At least nothing left that you recognize. Your days and weeks all become a blur and you're just a shell going through the motions until one day you stumble and the world comes to a halt. Suddenly your eyes well up with tears and 28 years worth of trauma comes rushing out of them. But you can't let anyone see you being weak. No one can know you struggle like this. So you shove everything down and put your fake smile back on because people depend on you. And the cycle continues. All because you were made to be the one people get help from but never the one people want to help.,1753663721.0,2025-07-28 00:48:41+00:00,2,2,depression,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb2j5u/im_tired/
1mb2hon,It all seems so pointless.,"I was married for 6 years and it was a toxic relationship and I cheated on my wife.... I then had a nearly 6 year relationship with said girl. The girl involved Cory was my wife at the time Tori's best friend. I had one child with Tori and helped raise Cory's 4 children as a stepdad post divorce. 

Cory and I got engaged and the kids new me as Dad and she had a good paying job so since we had 5 kids I told her I could be a stay at home Dad and do the cooking, cleaning, entertaining, discipline, getting them to school, appointments etc. and I do this for a long time. But I had developed a drinking problem because we were having small parties. Since Cory had moved in with her children as they lost their place due to it being condemed. Her husband was always gone at work or with his friends and ditched her. And my wife ignored me and was abusive physically and emotionally and Cory and I kind of vented and leaned on each other and once thing lead to another. Anyways back to the subject She started acting weird and distant. I just knew something was wrong ""I'm a Scorpio"" And she denied and denied and denied. But this ""Boss of hers"" would give her rides to work to save on gas and all of the sudden she was going on work trips to Seattle and California. And I am taking care of all the children this entire time and she was having a fucking affair. 

She sent her son over with her old phone and had her text now linked. He had set it down next to me and it was just going off like crazy and I was just looking and I see them messaging and I saw everything they ever said... I blew up and called her work. Told her to come get the kids and leave work because I can't handle it and be a parent right now I'm broken and devastated. The dude ends up calling me... Spouting all this shit about how she said we weren't together yada yada yada... He said she was fucked and we should both avoid her... He didn't avoid her btw... 

She got fired from her job over this situation as the work drama was affecting things etc... But a few months later she got her job back and got a new place and she said she was done with this guy and I love them all. They are my family so I moved in and tried. And again she would leave for work and who picked her up? Joe the same dude! 

And then Joe texts me and says we're you at Cory's I swear I saw you in the window. So I again broken. Texted Cory and wanted an explanation or I was going to reply with the truth. She freaked out and begged me not to tell him. That I had to be a secret because her job had a problem with me because of the lies she had told about myself and my family a long with me contacting her manager over personal business. 

The people we lived with were absolutely crazy. Turned off our power and then Internet and Cory snapped and fought this girl and I had to pull them apart. We left but I forgot my wallet and other important things and they would let me in so I'm broke through the double door entrance. I'm 6'4 and 245 at the time. 

I grabbed my stuff and I left because I had a bench warrant at the time for missing a court date over a previous family dispute. And she calls me begging me to come back because they needed my statement otherwise it was 2v1 so I did knowing I myself could be arrested. 

They ended up arresting the other girl and letting us go. We had to pack and leave that day. Lost a lot of things. 

And she went to live with her mom and I went back to my parents. And she stayed at work. And she ended up getting her own place and would invite me over and we felt like a family but she wouldn't let me move on and I didn't understand until I start to notice another mans jewelry, his PlayStation that he let her kids borrow cause he didn't use it. Smh please. 

One day I came over and she forgot to hide the framed photos of her and this other man... Fuck. And this was a different one. Some punk kid 6 years younger than me 30 at the time so he was 24 and she was 5 years older than me at 35. 

She ended up losing that place. We fought a lot. I put up a bunch of boundaries that we are just friend and I just wanna see the kids. And for a long time she would make time for me to come see them. 

But then she moved in with her sister and all of the sudden I can't visit. I can't see the kids. All the sudden she has a new car... And she had been laid off for 4 months at this point. 

But she always messages me and calls me things like when we were together and says she loves me and get jealous if I try to move on but won't lock it down and try again with therapy and counseling. 

So do you think she is yet again with another man? Her sister kicked her out and she claims she has been sleeping in her car. But she got the car from her sister so why would she let her take it? 

She got a new job. And is getting a new place and says things like I can't wait until we get our new place and I'm so excited to be together again. Ect. 

But she always needs 
$10 here for gas $10 for food or drinks over here. 
And always uses the kids as a focus. I know she is manipulating me.... 

But I still am in love with her and I could forgive her if she could be honest and let go and work on herself. To save the family we built. The future we had planned. I worked on myself a lot too. 

Turned to alcohol after she left for 2 years ending in a eternal bender until I had to self admit to treatment. I'm 5 months sober and working on my health, wealth and work. Asking with my daughter if course. 

So what do I do? Do I cut her out of my life and lose the only access I have to those kids. Is it weird I love my step kids so much it hurts more to lose them at this point. All the things I taught them. All the adventures we went on and promises I made. And she fucking made me break those promises. Over and over and over. 

Do I hope they come find me when they are older and we can regain our relationships? 

Do I continue to try to fix it with Cory? Because if it takes me 2-4-6-8-10-15-20 years she is the only woman my heart wants. Even after all the lieing and pain she put me through... And that would be a epic story of love overcoming all onsticale right
.. 

I know I'm lonely. It's been almost 3 years now since we split. I haven't dated anyone. I've kinda just locked it in. But I'm getting so lonely and sad. I miss my family. And I'm starting to think it will never happen. But how do I move on? I have so much trauma. I will have trust issues and put up walls to protect myself. I'll be cold and not vulnerable. 

She stole the man I was. My confidence my Vibe my spark of life. It feels extinguished. And I'm working with counseling, therapy, outpatient group l, AA and my medical treatments andI still feel this way. Empty. Lost. Alone. 

And I'm starting to feel like it's gunna be this way forever and I'm always going to be alone because I can't let her go... And she doesn't want me. 

And by the time she does want me. It would probably only be because of my potential success or my inheritance she is aware of. And if you can't love me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best. But the heart want what it wants...

Thankyou for reading. I will take any encouragement or advice. And answer questions if you have any. ",1753663599.0,2025-07-28 00:46:39+00:00,0,3,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb2hon/it_all_seems_so_pointless/

1mb24qq,Im trying to find a reason to keep going,"I recently turned 39, male, and I feel like my life ended long ago.  Right out of high school, my dad passed away suddenly from a heartattack in his sleep, it absolutely destroyed my mother, and I had to toughened up to keep her and the rest of my family going.  Since then, I was the one who had to take care of everyone in my family.  My sister passed away in her sleep, my aunt (mothers side) passed away in my living room when she came up for my sister's funeral.  My brother had a falling out with the rest of our family when it was discovered he was sexually abusing his children.  My Grandmother passed away after a long health decline and hospice.  Before Covid, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, and I essentially worked a full time job and was the only person who stepped up to care for her.  She's been gone for over a year now, and I'm now the only person left of my family, my entire adult life has basically been used to take care of my family, and I'm now left without a purpose.  I work, barely make enough to scrape by, i search for better jobs, and try dating, but nothing has worked out.

1mb20ou,"Maybe, I’ve always been a loser","I’ve always had trouble making friends. I’ve always misinterpreted social cues. I’ve never known how to dress. I’ve always had problems beings perceived or with my body. I thought I was fat even when I wasn’t. My anxiety runs so rampant. Before it fueled me to overachieve, but now I can’t do anything. It paralyzes me from doing better for myself. My apartment is filthy. My hair is a bird’s nest and I’m too anxious/broke to get it braided.

Everyone is progressing and I’m stuck here. Ugly, alone, and broke. Is this how my 30s are going to look? Watching my friends have kids with their husbands. Watching my younger siblings get engaged when I’ve yet to have a serious relationship. How much longer will life happen around me while I sit frozen? I want to be better, but the first step feels like moving in cement. Even my hobbies, art, reading, watching tv shows, it takes so much mental fortitude to make myself do.

I think the problem is that I’ve always been a loser. I’ve tried to change my place in this world, but it was never meant for me. Even when I was happy, I wasn’t. It was better, but it wasn’t *good*. If I just accept my fate, maybe I can be finally be satisfied.

1mb0alw,Bupropion + Concerta/ When will I feel like myself again?,"I've been in a rut for almost two years now. I don't know how to get better and just feel normal... I have no energy, no interest to do anything, no motivation. I just feel numb almost, like I'm going through my day and repeat.

A bit of context: In September 2023 I started out-patient rehab for opioid addiction. Couple months in I switched from Suboxone tablets to Sublocade injections. Also been on Sertraline 150mg and Divaolprex for bipolar.

Ever since starting rehab I've had a hard time properly taking my stimulants. I've tried all of the main ones (Adderall, Concerta, Vyvanse, Ritalin). So far I find that Concerta is the best fit for me, but I've always struggled to take it properly as well (could take about 100-120mg at once and feel nothing) so my body just became tolerant. 

I read about Bupropion and how it really helps with energy and motivation etc. so I made thw switch two weeks ago. Just finished my first week on 300mg today. As for Concerta, I finally got my impulses under control and have been taking them properly, once a day at 72mg going on two weeks. 

I know these things take time and that my body needs time to readjust to normal doses and new antidepressants, but so far I don't feel any different. It says online that you can start feeling the effects of Bupropion as quickly as 1-2 weeks and upwards to 6-8 weeks. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has been in the same boat as me and has any tips on how to feel normal again? Do I just have to wait it out for 6-8 weeks and then I'll magically feel better? 

And about the Concerta, will my body readjust to the point where I start feeling it again? My doctor refuses to give me any Ritalin boosters in the afternoon/evening because he says I'm already taking the max.

1mazqyy,Girl who hates herself to death,"Every single day, I (f26) feel this unbearable urge to do something reckless, something I could never undo. It’s like a shadow whispering in my ear, reminding me that I’m trapped in a life I can’t escape. I can’t bring myself to believe that anyone truly loves me beyond my family’s obligation to do so. It feels like my entire existence has been a cycle of being used, broken, and discarded by people who only ever saw me as something to take from. And the worst part is, I can’t even hate them for it because deep down I blame myself. I feel like I was born for this, born to be nothing more than someone others exploit until there’s nothing left. That thought doesn’t just hurt. It devours me piece by piece until I can barely breathe.

I hate myself with every fiber of my being. I hate myself so much that I don’t even think I’d want to be friends with me if I met myself as a stranger. And it’s not about my looks, because ironically, I actually think I look good. People tell me that all the time. But it doesn’t matter, because beauty means nothing when your soul feels rotten. I hate my personality. I hate my mind. I hate the life I was given and the person I’ve become. I hate every single part of myself until there’s nothing left to hate. I have so little respect for myself now that I feel like I’m barely even human anymore. I feel worthless, like a ghost walking through life without purpose, without hope, without anything.

Sometimes I think about dying, but I’m too terrified to even try. Maybe that makes me a coward. Maybe it makes me weak. I’ve hated myself my entire life, but when 2020 came, it was like something inside me broke completely. The hatred got louder, sharper, more cruel. And I can’t make it stop. I’ve been fighting for so long, screaming silently for something to change, but the feeling never leaves. It clings to me like a curse. What are you supposed to do when your own existence feels like a prison? Is it better to just give up and let it all end, or to keep fighting when every day feels like another slow death? Because I swear, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. 

I even “dream” about being raped, that’s how little respect I have for myself. Is that normal?

I spend most of my time alone at home…talking to myself about how I just feel. It’s a deadly addictive loop. 

I have stopped showering some days, I have trouble brushing my teeth, i don’t pray anymore, and eating feels like a chore. Just want to put it out there I am very thankful that my parents cook for me everyday and my fridge is filled with groceries. 

I used to weight about 95lbs and now it’s 88lbs. I don’t feel interested in anything and I feel like I will be a failure in life. I am planning to transfer to a college but I just have so much analysis paralysis…I cannot even sleep properly.

1maynp6,I told my ex that I was going to kill myself and now I don't know what to do,"I don't know how to use reddit. Look, three months ago I told my ex that I was going to end my life. I have been struggling with suicide for years, and it had recently come back full force. The lady and I had been struggling to make things work; she wasn't well and I really wasn't well. 

I told her that I was going to die at the end of that week. She came outside her house and tried to talk to me. I eventually told her that if she told our priest that I'd do it that night. Her mom called the police to stop me from hurting myself and I haven't spoken to her since. 

  
I've been fixing myself, both for my own life and for the promise I made for her to change. I've lost 50+lbs, got a new place, been more Catholic than I ever have tried to be. I feel better. Though she's not there, and it feels a bit darker all the time. She blocked me the night I told her I would die. I know you all have heard the same story of I don't want to lose her, but I don't. I had lost myself to depression, marijuana abuse, and just letting my world crumble altogether. I was the reason things had fallen apart in the first place. 

  
The problem is is that I can't see a reconnection being possible. I hurt, scared, and overwhelmed her more than anyone should do to anyone. I miss her dearly, and I want to try and speak to her soon. I just don't want to hope in anything, or on the other side of the coin put the wight back on her.

Am I screwed? Should I just give it up? I know people have heard the same ""I can't get over her; I miss her; She was so special;"", but she truly was to me. She changed my life in ways I didn't think were possible, and I don't want to miss a single second of her incredible remarkable life. Just tell me what you think. This will be the place I decide if I will try to go up to her or not. I will listen, I promise, just don't shut me down just to do it.

I even tried getting back into old hobbies and setting new goals. Got back into Judo, which may have may things worse because now I’m even more worn out and exhausted. I also got accepted to a masters program for Computer Science at a school I never thought I’d get into and that hasn’t reignited my interest in life.

Ive watched and read up on every topic I find interesting and now I have nothing left. The only thing that I can think of fixing is my sleep, but I’ve been trying and it’s just to hard for me to get a good nights sleep. I’d like to think that if I was sleeping well I’d find more things interesting, and have more energy and not be sore all the time.

1maxgpz,I don't know how to deal with my friends.,"A bit of history. When I was younger I used to move a lot bc of family stuff. I've had at least 8 elementary schools. Because of this I was bad at socialising, and was very uncomfortable around ppl. I was scared that if I got attached, I would loose them again. Then finally my family settled for a few years where I made great friends. But then we moved again. I was devastated. Its also around the time when I found out I had depression and generalised anxiety disorder. Anyways after the new move I was alone for a while. But after a while a guy approached me and we became friends. We weren't that close, but it was mostly my fault. But we ended up becoming gold friends after a year. Anyways now I have 3 good friends who care about me a lot. And I care about them. But because of my GAD and depression I never have the energy to talk or hang out with them. I try, I really do but I can't. I always feel unwanted, and like a burden. I also alway feel like a third wheel. I just don't know what to do. I'm slowly loosing them. I don't want to, but I can't do anything.

Just a passing thought, but it hit me again, how alone I really am.

I have a treatment, I tryied a bunch of them, but I feel so absolutely terrible and miserable

  
I don't enjoy anything anymore, video games, show, animes, sports, friendships, talking to people

  
I don't have ambition anymore, I have panic attacks every day about what death is and I live with a permanent feeling of anxiety

  
I wish I could have fun doing anything again, it's been like that for more than a year, and prior to that it was already awful

  
I honestly don't even know anymore what it feels like to have peace of mind, my brain is in a constant state of pain or anxiety or both

  
I don't know what to do anymore, I'm still progressing, getting my driver license, working on getting a job in a different field, etc. But idk, nothing feels good, even hot showers feels ""wasted"" where before it was one of my only solace

  
Anyway, I had to write that somewhere, if anyone been through that and have any advice I'd take them

1max9oz,It feels like I’ve been fighting for my life for decades. I pray the universe will send something positive my way.,"

It feels like I haven’t had the chance to breathe in 20 years. It’s just one thing after another. Whether it be poverty, loneliness, depression, assault, car accidents, illness,  death, it feels like I’ve been taking a beating. 

I’m trying to remember the last time I was happy. I mean genuinely happy and carefree. I can’t recall a time, no matter how dramatic that sounds. 

I grew up extremely poor. I mean, and I can’t stress this enough, VERY poor. We didn’t have Christmas, birthdays, etc. We barely even had a working car. My mother would walk to and from the grocery store. I couldn’t afford to go to college, and I’m still struggling financially today. I work 50+ hours a week, and it’s not enough. I pray I get the chance to live comfortably, at some point in my life.

I’ve been lonely my entire life. Even the people who are in my life, I get the sense they don’t actually enjoy my company. I’ve I don’t reach out to anyone, I could go days without hearing from people. My own mother has gone 6+ months without talking to me…just because I wasn’t the one to call first. People, who I genuinely thought were my friends, don’t ever reach out first. My birthday was in March, and not a single one reached out. My father only reaches out when he wants money from me. On my birthday, he reached out asking me to pay his rent. He had no clue it was my birthday. I felt so cheap and used 

I’ve never fallen in love. I’ve had feelings for people, but they were never reciprocated. No matter how hard I try, nothing ever goes anywhere. It’s like people disappear once they get to know me. I pray I one day feel genuine love from people. 

I just wish the universe would send something positive my way. Whether it be big or small. I won’t refuse. Just something to get me excited about life again. I promise I will return the favor. Sometimes, it feels like I was put on this earth to suffer and sort out problems

My question is, how do you keep the hope alive? How do you manage to keep a positive mindset, when it’s one thing after another? It feels like everyone is experiencing life, and I’m just on the sidelines.

No matter how dramatic this all sounds, it’s how I truly feel. I pray things will get better ",1753649578.0,2025-07-27 20:52:58+00:00,3,1,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1max9oz/it_feels_like_ive_been_fighting_for_my_life_for/

1mavv4a,tell me if things will ever get better,"i’ve been on sertraline for around two years now. i quit two months ago without notifying my psychiatrist, because i didn’t have one anymore as i have been redirected to a different institute that has a waiting list of years, -unbeknownst to the previous institute- because they couldn’t help me anymore. i quit because i was dead inside and out, i couldn’t feel, i couldn’t mourn my mothers loss, i couldn’t get excited, nor appreciate what i had. and maybe TMI, but “down there” was also completely dead.

it has ruined me entirely, my relationship, under the guise of being stable and alive, i became devoid of emotion. it’s a double edged blade because neither of it felt right- subdued so i don’t want to unalive or mutilate myself anymore, or feel the world but spiral into depressive bouts with regrets and terror that won’t leave me unless i take diazepam and fall asleep, if i don’t lose control and mutilate before i do. once i stopped i started to feel things again, i felt creative, happier, i cared, but the depression hit twice as hard when the thoughts that plague me want to sabotage my entire existence once again arose.

i called an emergency psychiatrist over suicidal thoughts and thinking about ending it, and suddenly they could plan me in for an appointment. i felt relief and hope for some pill that will do something differently. a short visit, explaining i have adhd, borderline, severe depression and ptsd with intrusive thoughts of regrets that happen at night when i can’t reach out or find distraction anymore, not that that helps, because once it’s there, there’s nothing that will help me, the psychiatrist came to the conclusion we should try citalopram, starting that same day.

it’s been two weeks now, i am in hell.. i have distanced myself from any and everything i had left, i quit my band, i haven’t touched my guitar for weeks, i don’t take care of myself anymore, i barely shower, walk in the same clothes every day, there’s dishes in the kitchen i haven’t washed for weeks, i barely eat (sometimes rice). i sleep, wake up, feed my cats, and go back to sleep again. every single day for the last 15 days..

i don’t want to burden anyone with the sorry state i am in, of which none actually care or are able to help (and i don’t blame them for that), i just want to feel better, but it feels like that’s only possible with a pill at the cost of becoming an empty shell.

internally i feel this isn’t right, my mind screams and begs to cry, feel anger, direct it onto myself for being this way, but it never comes out. it’s like i am in a prison that doesn’t allow me to. this split of being aware of both edges is driving me into deeper depths.

1mavk8p,I'm having trouble trusting my family emotionally,"For about a year, I've been in low-contact with my mom, who emotionally, financially, and mentally abused me and my siblings our entire lives. In that past year, me and my little brother have sought asylum with my father, who's equally emotionally unavailable. He's just not as mentally unstable. I've gone to school in that year along with my sister, which has helped me feel more confident about achieving independence and self-love, but coming back to his house this intersession has taught me just how emotionally negligent both sides of my family are.

  
It feels like i have to fight for my dad and even his wife's (who's done more for me mentally than a lot of people in my life) support. They often say ""A closed mouth doesn't get fed"", but my problem is if you know this person is struggling and you can see this person has a lot on their shoulders emotionally and financially, why are you requiring that they spill their guts instead of meeting them halfway? And I wouldn't even be so resentful of that perspective if I felt like they actually helped with their advice. So many times I've made the mistake of being emotionally vulnerable around them, and their retaliation is: 



""Well, people are going to be like that no matter where you go.""

""It feels like you're being dramatic"" 

""You see how I gave you an audience..."" 

""\[You're\] always in some crisis..."" 

""Why don't you just tell the truth?""

  
It just feels like they don't understand what I'm going through, and they don't want to understand. And it hurts because I have only one close friend, and I don't wanna ruin our friendship by seeking validation and love through them, but making them feel like they're my emotional punching bag. My sister is the only person in my life who I know can actually understand what I'm going through, but she's struggling as well. And so many times, our discussions ended in a cold stalemate because we just couldn't see eye to eye.

  
I'm just feeling so lonely. Maybe I am the problem, and I'm dramatically holding my family to a higher standard than necessary. Maybe I just need to understand that life just isn't meant for me. I'm more or less just looking for some clarity, some kind of wake-up call to tell me so I can better understand what's wrong.",1753645400.0,2025-07-27 19:43:20+00:00,2,0,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mavk8p/im_having_trouble_trusting_my_family_emotionally/

I'm making my life worse and I don't cange. I just can't. I don't have any energy to fight myself and my actions. And actually I don't want to.

My whole life is just day after day hoping I don't wake up the next day. 

I can't do anything. I can't even kill myself. I'm trapped here. I'm forced to exist because of me. Because I can't do anything. I just feel so trapped. It's so hard to do stuff when you don't even want to exist.

1maui88,I want to vent a little,"My friend yesterday tried really hard to have me say I like girls. I just told him I was going to Germany, and he said ""Riiight, to pick up German girls"". This is tremendously tone-deaf, as he was literally the second person in my life I told I was gay as a teen. It's not the first time. I don't like girls. I tried to dismiss it, and speak about the point of the trip, but he asked again ""AND pick up german girls, right?"". I wanted to leave my own house.

It sucks so much. I told a friend once I wished I wasn't gay so my parents wouldn't deny me speaking about my attraction, so I hadn't hurt myself because of it, so I had had the opportunity to have relationships and develop romantically before I leave my house, so I hadn't stayed in an abusive, secret relationship that only filled me with anxiety with a person who was merely manipulating me and exploiting the fact he had me vulnerable, and his response was ""So you do wish you could like girls?"". 

And then another friend still, spend an hour questioning me, asking me if I really had never felt anything. If I wasn't just denying myself of it. if I wasn't confused. If I wasn't trying to be gay. In the end, he said something like ""Oh, but you can't really know if, someday down the line, a woman shows up and you find her attractive"". I looked at him, defeated and just said ""Yeah. I've met thousand, and have felt nothing towards them, but you're right. I can't deny it is possible, simply because you can't prove a negative"", and that pleased him 

Is it really so wrong I like guys? Is it really that big of a problem? Will there be anyone with me if I get married? Will I have to attend events alone even if I have a partner? Just to suit them? Will my family and friends only like me if I'm straight?",1753642854.0,2025-07-27 19:00:54+00:00,1,0,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1maui88/i_want_to_vent_a_little/

I’ve been doordashing to pay the bills when I’m in between panic attacks. Recently I can feel like depression becoming overwhelming. I’ve gained 20+ pounds. All I do it’s lay in bed when I’m not doordashing intermittently. My body feels like i weigh 500 lbs. I can’t make eye contact with anyone anymore, I don’t even have the effort to talk to my family. I haven’t hung with my friends with years because how controlling he is. But yet I don’t leave? I don’t understand. It’s not even at the point I want to leave anymore I NEED TO leave before I kill myself. How do I get past this and get the strength to leave and get better? My nervous system is so broken and always spiked. I never stop ruminating on bad thoughts or stuff he’s did to me. All he does is play video games non stop while I lay in bed trying to stay alive. I do love life. I used to be such a bright individual. He has taken all my life from me since I’ve been 19 years old. I need to physical strength to leave and mentally but how do I get there?

I've tried a range of medicines. But I think even the therapists I've seen don't know why I'm depressed. Nothing bad happened to me. No SA, no drug abuse, no abandonment, no poverty. But I remember being suicidal even as a child. And my therapists make comments that I should be better. After a while I've just told them I feel better so I don't have to feel like this huge disappointment. My biggest problem is my procrastination. I can't seem to take my pills consistently anymore. I can't seem to do anything lately. Everything is a burden. I've been encouraged to go back to therapy, but I feel I will be judged. I look at my life and think anyone else could have done a better job than I did. I feel like I was given the tools to make myself better but I failed.

1matlrx,Why is the weight of my intrusive thoughts so heavy,"Don't even have the energy to write or explain anything to anyone anymore because now I don't even know what is going on. I'm in all honesty tired, I'm trying at the same time but it's so exhausting. I just deleted the contacts of so many people I barely talked to or who barely cared about my existence, most of them were people from university and school. It's so hard to be so lonely and friendless as a girl. People look down on you so much, mock you, etc. Fine I'm the problem. I'll just accept whatever you'll tell me, me being bad, me being unworthy all of it. Now I'm even scared that even if I stumble upon a good bond in my life (impossible since I never had one) I'll ruin it before they do. Now I've actually become the part of the problem I think. Depression is consuming my head and my physical health keeps deteriorating, even believing in the existence of God feels too tiring and unreal. I don't have any friends, any close cousin, or even someone I'm close to or can rely on. I just feel like I don't belong anywhere. Sorry for being so lifeless and friendless that I have nobody to tell this but I'll just put it here. I hope I don't go back to anyone who made me miserable (please pray for me that I don't,no matter how lonely, depressed and sucidal I am because a part of my mental health got ruined because of the people around me, few of them I cannot escape anytime soon maybe). I just feel the urge to leave home and run some way far but deep inside I know that I won't even find peace there and it'll still haunt me, I'm even attached to my trauma and everything that makes me miserable ig. Can everyone just hurt me together at the same time so that I don't have to go through it every day, week, month, year, etc. If I've been fine through all this then I'm sure I won't kms because of this, it'll solely be me, nobody else.

1matlf7,Why am I like this?,"Why do I not do anything? Just staying in my house, hopping around from my bed to my computer to my kitchen. I hate my parents even though they've done so much for me. They've bought me everything I ever asked for, they have taken care of me when I was sick. But the care feels fake, like an obligation that they have to put up with rather than actual love and I'm pretty sure they hate me. And they have good reasons to, I haven't performed well in my college exams, I am lagging behind in terms of my career, I isolate myself all the time, I am a fat ugly piece of shit, I'm a failure in pretty much all aspects of life. I'm honestly surprised they do the shit they do for me but at the same time I don't really care.
They keep trying to give me advice like ""go workout"", ""man up and force yourself"", ""you're just being lazy"", ""you've wasted so much time"" and it just makes me want to kill myself more. As if I didn't feel guilty enough for being a lazy asshole. 
Why does life have to be like this? Why can't I just tell myself to do something and just do it instead of running away from it. I see people around me doing incredible things and feel so much more left behind. I want to be better, I want to be smart, I want to be fit, I want to be successful but it just feels like I don't have the energy to do it. I try and immediately fail.

1mat67s,I feel so stupid,"I’ve let my depression overtake my life since I was 13. I’m 19 now, and trying to get my GED. I dropped out when I was in 10th grade. If I would have stuck around for 2 more years, if I had sucked it tf up and got through those classes, I wouldn’t be in the position I am now. 

My memory has gotten so bad, and I’m having to relearn how to do geometry and algebra. I’ve always been horrible at math, but I feel so stupid for forgetting. I feel like I’m not going to pass it. I’ve passed my history exam, and I’m taking my English exam today, so I’m almost half way through. I took a practice test for math, and I got a 139. I barely got by with my other practice tests. 

I’m so fucking stupid. I didn’t go anywhere in life for 5 years and now I’ve forgotten almost everything. I wish I would have just stayed in school. I could have graduated last year, could be in college now. But I let myself go and let it take over me. How does one even forgot how to do algebra and geometry? How fucking stupid do I have to be to forget that stuff after only 5 years. 

I want to be positive, but it’s hard to be. I want to pass this so bad. I want to pick up my life. But I’m holding myself back.

1mat3xe,My Personality,"For introductions, I am a male in my 30’s, married with a 2yo. son.

I don’t really know where to start, other than I’m tired of being me. I’ve always had a silly personality, which is a defense mechanism for all the trauma I’ve lived through; multiple deaths of friends and family members, some suicides, overdoses, and accidents. Diagnosed with PSTD and GAD, but every therapist I’ve worked with doesn’t seem to know how to help me. 

I was a ten year alcoholic, been sober for four years total. In the past four years, I’ve been through the deaths of two more friends, my mother’s terminal cancer diagnosis, and a dead end career in retail management where I’m treated like an idiot. I feel like my only success is staying sober, which has surprisingly been easy, but I my main problem is my aforementioned personality… i want to change who I am, because I hate who I am..

My silly, whimsical personality keeps everyone happy and emotionally afloat at work. People clock in and are genuinely happy to see me because they tell me I make their day more tolerable when I’m there. Many of them lean on me for support, a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen to, and a source of smiles and laughs… But this comes with an opportunity cost, which is how I’m perceived..

You’d never know it, but inside I am very intellectual, cold, tired, solemn, and cynical compared to my external operating system-which is that of a silly clown . An internal/external dichotomy that represents my Gemini horoscope to an obnoxious degree. This is why when ai rattle off something intelligent in a meeting or with other employees, they are generally shocked and surprised. “WOW, where’d that come from!?” Or “Who are you, what did you do with the other guy?” I think the worst comment I’ve ever gotten, was from a former friend who said “How can somebody so brilliant be so stupid and silly at the same time?”… Yeah, that one felt great…

My wife has always been extremely loving and supportive, and tells me my silly personality is what she loves the most about me. I love her and our son, and they are without any doubt the two brightest stars in my dark world. But other people in my life (friends/family/work people) will say “When are you going to stop acting so silly and grow up?” Then when I try to be more serious and normal, and give them a taste of who I really am, those same people will say “What’s the matter with you? You’re not joking or smiling or being your normal weird silly self?”…. So, what do you want from me? I’m not a piece of clay that you can mold when it doesn’t suit you anymore. I also feel like this stupid, silly personality has affected my career, simply because I’m not looked at by my superiors as someone who should be taken seriously, regardless of how much of accomplished.

So if it didn’t already paint a picture, I’ve been conditioned to strongly dislike my daily external self, and wish I could train myself to bring my internal personality out more regardless of what others think. I know I’ve probably painted myself as some kind of narcissist, but I’ve always willingly helped other people, and gone above and beyond to make a positive difference in other people’s lives without needing a payment, prize, or praise. 

It just seems like what I know will heal me and help me, feels bad for some reason. Like destroying that part of me will hurt the people in my life who genuinely enjoy my silliness. After so long, I’m just tired of the beat down, and I find myself smiling less and less. I don’t bounce back from my lows as quickly as I used to, and I’m finding it easier to be more sullen than usual. 

They say you should never change yourself for anyone, but the stupid, silly person that I am is not going to get me a career that makes money, nor is it going to help me to be taken seriously at my job. I’m also tired of not being taken seriously by friends and family outside of my loving wife and child, because everybody thinks I’m an idiotic court jester. 

I am who I am, but who I am does not fit the formula to be successful in our society. And though it’s who I naturally am on the outside at least, it’s getting tiring for my inner self to keep this up. 

***Just as a disclaimer*** I am at the very least comfortably stable, and I am no risk to myself. I’ve come too far to even think about something like that, and love my wife and son too much. I’m just emotionally exhausted from being who I am, and I’m curious if anybody else is in the same boat and can relate. Thanks for reading my rant.

1masrsa,I don’t know what to do,"Things started getting bad again about 2 months ago. I’m on meds, I have a psychiatrist, but I’ve started experiencing flashbacks from my last relationship, my anxiety is to the point where my brain is coming up with scenarios that *could* happen, but haven’t. And it’s like I have no control over them. 

My grandma passed in June and it spiked my anxiety even more, I’m scared to leave my mom at home while I go to work. I’ve mainly been working nights so i’m off at 9 or 9:30-9:45 and the thought of my mom sitting at home while i’m at work just makes me start sobbing and I don’t know why. I’ve been crying on my way to work and on my way home. I’ve barely been able to take care of myself because I just feel so incredibly exhausted. I’m putting off/forgetting to eat so then I start feeling nauseous and irritable. Which then makes it even harder to get through my shift because I have no energy. 

I’m supposed to be started ptsd therapy and it sounded like a good idea at first, but now I’m dreading it and I’m thinking of pulling out of it because I don’t really want to spend my day off having ptsd therapy and then have to go to work the next day. I feel like it’s going to make things worse than they already are because I’m going to be working through my trauma, and I genuinely don’t think I haven’t had a year where something traumatic *hasnt* happened. 

I’m on auto pilot at this point, and I want to call out of every shift I have. Even the short ones. I work in customer service so I’m talking to customers literally all day during my shift and I’ve been so short tempered that I’m having to stop myself from being straight up rude to customers that are giving me a hard time. I don’t even want to talk to my co workers because I don’t have anything good going on in my life right now. I’m trying to find a new job to start a career but the position I’m looking for, there’s zero openings even as far as 30 minutes to an hour from where I’m at. 


I don’t have friends outside of the couple girls I’m semi close with at work. I don’t ever hangout with anyone besides my mom. I’m starting to prefer it this way because I don’t even have the energy to hang out with anyone. At the same time though, I love going to concerts and I’ve been going to some raves, but I’ve been going alone for a couple years now that I barely get excited for the event. I know it’s fine to do things alone, but seeing everyone else have fun with their friends, seeing people like hug each other while singing along to songs while I’m just trying to not care that I don’t have anyone to share the experience with me. I have a concert planned in a couple months, going alone, and I’m already thinking of leaving early. I used to have so much fun doing things alone and I didn’t mind it, but now it just feels so depressing. It also feels like a reminder that I don’t really have anyone in my circle besides my mom and my cousin to be honest. I’m just tired of struggling every day.

1masaso,I think I reached a new low even by my own low standards,"A little contexts, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and dysthymia (aka: Persistent depressive disorder) since my teens, I always been in a shitty mood that's not exactly a new thing to me, it's just that I always neglect the stuff that you're supposed to do as an adult, yk like laundry and chores, today as I got a bit of a boost to actually try and clean my room I ended up finding fucking baby cockroaches under my old tangled wrinkly clothes on the floor, problem is I'm not even ashamed from how hopeless I already feel, I barely got outside anymore (I literally quit my job because I just couldn't handle working alone most of the day, yes it's awesome to work alone untill you run out of music and then your brain gets too loud) I only go outside to either just go drive at speeds of 150 kph (93 MPH for the US folks) in a god damn Toyota blasting music so I can somehow ""outrun"" the pain or to just get some happy chemistry going in my brain, I just don't understand how can I reach such a low like his yet still be alive and ""functioning""  as you may have guessed as well my self worth and self image are as good as dirt that can't even be used to farm anything since it's so fucked.

My psychiatrist did put me on SSRI that one time but let's just say it went horribly wrong and I was actually at his office yesterday but I didn't feel like shit then (which I feel I should've mentioned to him) and didn't tell him about it, but he did ask if I felt any sadness and I told him u actually feel hopeless instead and he asked about how do I make myself feel better and I told him it's either I speed om the highway or use random AIs and put in my earbuds to live in a world or my own which I guess seemed good enough for him.

Basically I just don't know what to do anymore, I either feel like shit or feel good for 5 minutes then feel like shit then feel hopeless then feel numb and all over again.

1maruuy,I need help with my wife,"Hi, I don't know what to do or how to address the following with my wife: We've been together for 12 years and married for 10 years. We've had a healthy son for 2.5 years. We've been through a lot together, with calling emergency services at night because of panic attacks, changing medication, overdoses, etc. She was switched to paroxetin for the pregnancy and birth. The biggest problem is the side effects: loss of libido. It's progressed to the point where she no longer has any desire and doesn't get wet. She doesn't even want to cuddle or kiss anymore, the desire is completely gone. I've already asked her whether she wants to switch again, but she's too scared. She says she suffers from the loss of libido herself. It's been 3 years now, and I'm only allowed to feel physical closeness once a month. When she ovulates, she also gets wet. It's putting me under a lot of stress, and I don't know what to do. I love her and don't want to put pressure on her just because I'm asking a second time. But of course, I can't get my satisfaction elsewhere. Like I said, I love our family and don't want to ruin everything just because of my stupid needs.

1marhps,Losing My Will to Keep Going,"I fucking hate my depression and how it affects my every day life. Ive been on everything medication the Dr can think of to try and help but there is no help. The medications will keep me ""normal"" for a few months, but then I no longer experience the effects I should be.

Ive been with my wife for almost 12 years and have 3 wonderful and amazing children. But even knowing that I have all of them who love and care about me, I just can't help but feel useless and hopeless. I dont have interest in anything that i used to enjoy, i dont want to do anything at all. I do what is expected of me as a parent and spouse, but I dont even have the energy to do anything I want to anymore.

I have no friends, never really have. Ive tried counseling but there is something about the environment that I just cant get past and I cant open up. Ive tried being able to talk to my wife about my feelings but I just cant bring myself to do it. Im too worried about disappointing her and my kids with what a loser and worthless fucking person I am. I recently had one person who I thought was my friend, we would talk to each other about shit we were going through, but after I got fired from my job this past week, they have ghosted me and disappeared from my life.

Im sitting here with my children, watching them play together and I should be smiling and happy. But instead im putting on a fake happy face, knowing how I have let them down, knowing im worthless and they would be better with someone else as their dad. I know my wife can do better than me, someone who can support her and the kids with no worry of whether or not they will be provided for.

My whole life I have just been one big disappointment to everyone that knows me. Ive disappointed my parents, my wife and my kids (even though none of them will admit it).

Ive literally come to a point where I feel like the best option for everyone is for me to just disappear. Nobody would have to be concerned about me or what ive failed to do in life. No more would they have to wonder and be worried about me. My depression wouldn't have to be something for anyone to have to worry about.

NO, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT KILLING MYSELF OR HURTING MYSELF, JUST STRAIGHT UP DISAPPEARING SO EVERYONE I KNOW CAN FINALLY HAVE A GOOD LIFE.",1753635702.0,2025-07-27 17:01:42+00:00,2,2,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1marhps/losing_my_will_to_keep_going/
1marewk,Cant beat my depression. Wasted life.,"Im a wm mid 40s. Wasted my whole life. Never finished college. Could never keep a job. Ruined every good relationship.

Ive been in bed almost a year now. Ruined last two good paying union jobs. I must be bipolar. 

Had alot of fun as a kid. Grew up in midwest in tiny town in the cornfields. 

I just cant do it anymore. Im starving to death. Was always very active and fit now im 116lbs and my house is destroyed and full of black mold. 

I live very close to my narccicist mother and older brothers. I never should have moved back here 12 years ago. I abused alcohol and got 2 felonies and DUIs..I cant work, my house is full of mold. No wife no job no children. I have 3 goats i love dearly they are only thing that has kept me alive for years. 

I have tried reaching out, ive tried medication and it made me worse. My best friends are dead. My otjer friends and family ghosted me after I had a mental breakdown and got arrested.

I cant stand being awake. I really have no hope for any chance of improvement. I cant find a job and my body is so weak now. Im sick from all the black mold. 

I wish i wouldnt have been such a people pleaser and made better decisions. I wish i never would have abused alcohol or smoked weed. I have ruined everything i have ever done. But my family really has been my worst enemy. I never fit in. 

I wish i would have been able to understand things at a younger age and just walked away from toxic people and family. Ive made too many mistakes. Ive been alone for 15 years and everyone thinks im gay or weird because i was always a decent looking person but i was so heartbroken over losing my girlfriend. 

Ive told my mother and finaly got my father to answer his phone and i told them both that im going to end my life. They acted mad but after telling them i have no way of working, my health, losing my house, etc i think they understand. Ive tried talking to old friends and family and they just ghosted me. Two of them actually mocked me and told me to just kill myself.

I was always willing to help people, i think bevause i wanted to be a people pleaser. Growing up with horrible parents amd siblings affected me more than I ever realized until i went to counseling. I really have nothing to live for. My goats are all i have and i love them so much. I dont know what will happwn to them  .

My teeth are rotting out, i havent bathed in over a year. I just cant get better. An elderly woman i met last year has been bringing me food occasionaly or i wouod have already starved to death. Ive lost over 50 lbs of muscle. 

I studied geology then went back and nearly finisjed RN school, then worked industrial construcrion. Ive lost or quit every job ive ever had. 

I really cant improve my life and i cant escape here. My family live very close to me and they wont even talk to me. I was always the scapegoat. I was bettet than them at everything and was always kind to them  . They never broke the cycle and i never should have lived around them again.

I made mistakes.plenty of them. i know i was always a doormat and in toxic relationships and i understand why now.

I guess im putting this out there because a younger person can see it and maybe benefit and not male the same mistakes. 

Focus on yourself, dont use alcohol or weed to numb yourself. Avoid toxic people and family. Exercise. Save money etc etc. 

I was told in bipolar and have cptsd by a counselor 4 years ago. I quit drinking 8 years ago and weed just makes me feel insane now. 

I loved my old friends, some died, some still alive. The love of my life got married after we broke up. She was single for 15 years just like me. 

I just want to unconscious. Its too much to handle now. I have nothing. No way to improvecmy life and criminal record keeps me from getting any kind of job. im so weak i cant work now anyways. 

Goodbye. I wish it could have ended diffetently but I cant deal with this pain and dread

1mar0w5,My parents say I choose to be depressed. Are they right ?,"I (f17) have had depression and anxiety clinically diagnosed for over 9 years, been in and out of therapy and was on medication for a few years but have been doing better recently. Over the last year or so I have finally come off meds, stopped therapy for nearly 2 years and have generally improved from the severe lows I was in frequently for pretty much all of my teenage years. I've always struggled with the fact that I have ""no reason to be depressed"", which has brought me a lot of guilt and made me feel lazy and pathetic for no valid reason, when others go through so much more and are able to cope better, although I have been working on this I guess? It's still a big issue for me which is why my parents comments are so hurtful. Now, my parents and I have a good relationship and 90% of the time they have been so supportive of me and great getting me help, but ultimately, neither of them have ever dealt with depression so my mindset makes no sense to them. Both are very positive people (i dont doubt they have struggled but fundementaly their mindset is very different from mine), and are big fixers, they just sort stuff out and I really struggle with that. this means particularly my mum, will often say that i choose to not snap  out of my moods or lows sometimes and i think she thinks shes being helpful but she genuinely says choose to be happy and choose happiness as if she hasn't seen me go to therapy for nearly a decade ? its confusing and they always seem shocked when i get low or panic attacks now because im ""passed it"" but ive been told by all doctors, this is a lifelong thing and that it's just about learning to deal with it and manage best i can, which is terrorfying and they don't seem to understand. i dont know how to make them realise that it really upsets me when theyre just like you choose this life and you choose to wallow when i feel like i make such an effort day to day that they don't understand. i also see a part of them that is correct, others are able to choose happiness and i want to but its frustrating that they veiw me this way.

Now i dont really wanna die, it just hurts too much being alive. My parents are amazing, maybe a bit strict sometimes but inside i love them.

1maqqlf,Came to talk,"
TW: self harm. Soo where do I begin? I’m not going to give every single detail or else I’d have to write a book but I (17F) think I’ve been struggling with depression for the last 5 years. I don’t want to diagnose myself but i know for sure in 2020 I was at rock bottom. I’ve been emotionally abused by my sister for years, it’s hard to describe her as a person. The only word I can think of is narcissist. It was probably only the last two years that I realize that the treatment is the root cause of a lot of my issues (anxiety, depression, eating disorder). It ruined my relationship with my mother as she continuously enabled my sisters behavior (and still does to this day) while pretending to play ‘neutral’. I was always expected to be the bigger person rather than the sister who is 11 years older than me. I was put down for my face, body, skin color, interests, everything. I was caught self harming and still encouraged to kms by said sister. I truly think she wanted me to take myself out. And my mother still allowed her to treat me horribly, painting me as the angry one and even lying on her behalf after witnessing first hand how I was treated for years. For context on my relationship with my mother, when we’re good, we’re great!! I’ve given her too many chances and she refuses to apologize/take accountability for anything she’s enabled/has done to me herself. Finally put my foot down and have decided after I move out(whenever that is) I’m going no contact

Well with school coming to a close and my 18th around the corner I’ve been losing all motivation to get up out of bed and go. My grades are perfect but my attendance is bad. Usually I’ll just say I don’t have school that day when she asks or make something up, deep down my mother probably knows I’m lying but she’s too lazy to care for the most part. But ik it will probably come up eventually once the school sends out attendance reports

To cut to the chase i self harmed again for the second time this year. 2020 was the last year I did it and I had to stop because i couldn’t move my hand. This time around it was deep and I just cried for half an hour as I tried to clean up. I cant figure out why i did it. I mean a cry for help? They heard me for the time and didn’t do anything about it so idk

I just think back to the time she smashed my laptop last year and kneeled on my face while I had a full on mental breakdown. Maybe I shouldn’t have said it but I told her if I kms ( a few hours later ) she’s to blame, she didn’t care. I wouldn’t say that now I know better, in fact I wish I didn’t say it at all. I’m sorry idk what I’m typing atp

I think one of the things that hurts me the most is that she had struggled with depression and has been on anti depressants herself. She acknowledges mental health and has spoken about it to me (not the pills but the feeling etc.), but when it comes to her own daughter (me) she couldn’t care less

Again I’m sorry for rambling. This is as brief as I can get it’s a lot. I just feel empty. I recall 2020 it was a mix of sadness and emptiness, it would switch a lot. Now i simply feel..hollow for the most part. And my 18th coming up is feeding into that more. Idk what to do with my life, I have no passion, it’s been so hard to find a job, I almost feel worthless

I feel terrible when I say I’m going to do something but then I forget or get overwhelmed to do it. This doesn’t happen often and I hate myself when I can’t follow through.

I feel useless to the world. I deserve to be called stupid, an idiot, useless, waste of space. 
I deserve to be ignored and ghosted.
Kick, slapped around and abandoned.

No one cares about me because I never put in the effort to make any one care and love me.

I just so useless and feel I mess up the connection to anyone I want to call a friend.

I hate it here. I wouldn’t even mind if I got caught in the cross hairs of someone accident or unfortunate events.

Waking up 3x a day for meds and quick meals, water, bathroom, and going straight back to bed.

I’ve recently ran into a depressive episode because of several health issues I have going on in my life that I will either need major testing or surgery for and I’m terrified.
And I’ve been sleeping..
I slept all Thursday. Had a big day Friday. Then slept all Saturday, and now it’s Sunday and I’m only awake to take meds and make this post.

I’m missing out on things I want to do, but also, I just wanted to see if this was… normal?
I don’t want to do it forever but when I stay awake I feel emotionally drained, I worry, I get stressed, I cry. I don’t do this when I’m asleep.

1map9mz,Hello!,"I think I’ll post updates here now and then, sort of like a journal.

I’ve had bad depression in the past. I can recognize symptoms all the way back to 8th grade. I felt like I couldn’t make friends, I didn’t have much motivation or plans, I kept to myself a lot. I would also try lots of ways to put myself out there, like cross country and choir, but I didn’t feel like I was making real social connections. I believed that if I could just get a couple good friendships, then I would feel better. I desperately wanted to feel included, valued, and that people really believed in me and would help me get through my mental struggles. These thought patterns have stayed with me still, and I’m now 25.

I’m now taking full responsibility for my mental state. I have a lot of healing to do. I recognize now that my mental health was affected by my family. My parents did not get along and argued weekly. If anyone saw my emotional needs, they would usually ignore them. My family was a place where I felt unseen, misunderstood, disconnected, confused, and anxious. The “happy” moments felt performative. I can see how my family experience shaped my expectations of every other social interaction.

I just moved out and am focusing on school. It’s nice to have distance from family. I don’t really have close friends right now, but I’m working on it and I really want to be a good friend for people.

I’m working on becoming a sustainability analyst. I hope in the next couple months, I can get a solid friend group. Finding a long-term partner obviously would be great too. When I’m done with school in the next couple years, I want to move to Portugal! I’m trying to rewrite my story. Things can be wonderful, and I can make that happen! It’s so hard sometimes, but I can do it.",1753630427.0,2025-07-27 15:33:47+00:00,2,1,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1map9mz/hello/
1maoxau,Sitting on the bathroom floor," I have a history with depression on and off for 20 years and I haven't hit a low like this  in the last 6 years. 

My partner's porn use and totally crippled my self worth. He's been comissioning artwork of his waifu he's had a para social relationship with for like a decade, while we've been together. 

I know this is such a stupid thing to be so upset about, but I have big self worth issues and I feel ridiculous for being so upset and jealous of a 2D teenager. 

I'm sat on my bathroom floor, drinking and crying, thinking I'm going to hurt myself. 

I'm so close to imploding my life, breaking up with my partner, moving out and starting again because I can't get over him wanting anime girls more than me. 

I love him, and he's good to me, but he leaves me feeling so worthless.

He'll be home in a couple hours and I don't want to tell him I snooped on his computer again. That I hate that I love him and he makes me feel like shit, because it feel like this is a me problem, and I should be okay with him watching porn and getting off to these anime girls he loves.

I'm sorry I just have no one to talk to about this and I needed to get this rant out of me.i
 I posted in another forum specially for these kinds of porn related issues and no one responded and I have no idea what to do when he gets home ",1753629598.0,2025-07-27 15:19:58+00:00,3,7,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1maoxau/sitting_on_the_bathroom_floor/

1maoobo,Help me please: chronic suicidal thoughts,"I have been suffering from severe depression for three years with almost constant suicidal thoughts. They are there because I can't stand it anymore, not because of external circumstances. I've lost a lot and been through a lot, but that's not it. It's the despair that it's just not getting better - despite clinics, medication, outpatient therapy. I'm so exhausted from fighting that I just can't and don't want to anymore. My thoughts are spinning all day long. Every day I pick myself up and try to get through the day - by working, breathing, seeing friends, exercising, going for walks.... But it doesn't get any better. I just can't feel anything positive. Just total exhaustion alternating with extreme anxiety. Or everything at the same time. And yet I'm writing here...

Why do I always have to care, and can never switch of my brain","6 years ago my depresion started when i just got to highschool and the first 2 years where in lockdown. no friends, nobody to talk to. Now I have realy tried hard after that lockdown to fit in, become social, become normal. Dont get me wrong I have come a very long way and am very prowed of it. but the problem is that i care to much

  
My depresion is no longer that I am unsocial and had no social life. No because of hard mental work im a very fun person to be around. the problem is that because i had to focus on that for so long i cant turn it off, wich limits my social interactions.

Everyting I plan feels like a strategic plan, I dont aproach girls for my insane fear of ""what others think"". I dont talk up to my friends scared i loos them or others. I overthink every single text everything.

1maobv1,How to enjoy things again,"I know that maybe my situation isn't as bad as other people's, but I have been feeling the need to talk about this for the longest time. In the past, despite having problems at home, I have always been absorbed by my favorite games and music through the internet. Therefore I escaped my bad thoughts and actually had an inclination to arts. But lately for the past 3 years or so, I have felt this constant hate for everything. I don't like anything and I don't like anyone, and even though I feel lonely I have no energy to talk to people to make something of it. I can probably say I have been jealous of teens around me for being more financially stable than me, because everytime I try to relate to a person irl my age they always have some crazy stories to say like ""I went to this country and that place!!!"" and I'm happy for them and it's not their fault but I just always feel left out. So in turn, I keep swallowing it up and moving on, feeling like a burden to other people. On the other side of the coin, I always feel like I end up with people my age who are always meanspirited and in my opinion just vile, and I want to have a life where all of that is gone. Another obstacle is my distance from everyone. I live in a very secluded area with not many people to meet except old people, my highschool was far away, and in middleschool I was bullied and physically assaulted for being weird. So my friends were pretty much non-existent. My mom is in a constant drunk cycle since I was essentially born, and my dad died in 2022. I can't say it's just because my dad died that I feel this way, but it really seems like my situation has been getting progressively worse. My whole family drinks away and I live in a third world country, so I would wish to escape them, but because I don't like anything, I have been living mostly on autopilot from what it seems, in turn not being very productive towards a certain made up goal I should be getting. I just do things to hear an at least ""good job!"" from someone, mostly related to schooling. My mom gave me to an art school and honestly I don't really enjoy it. It restrains me from at least feeling something when I draw. Now I have to do things I don't necessarily like and it really doesn't help with my current situation. Also the fact that said school is unfair and rich kids can just pay to be favored by teachers, therefore I have been told on several occasions I won't make it, or that my art is bad because I just have the typical internet animeish style, which art schools are notorious for not favoring. But most of us there have this artstyle, and it just really feels like I have been sidelined by this specific teacher. Besides that whole aspect, because I am on autopilot, or so I feel like it, the only thing I do in college is mostly to go home and constantly draw to be able to finish in time, because their scheduling is just very bad and you have to break at least a bone to finish exactly on time with your work if you want it ALL to at least look good. Sometimes I just stop doing whatever and I start crying because I am not enjoying it. I'm not enjoying sitting in the same place with no teacher feedback because they are too busy to favor the already good artists,or people who bribe, while I work away to be depreciated. As a result to me being on ""autopilot"", my friends have also been decreasing in number, since I can't help it anymore but to find what they have to say not interesting, and I feel bad for that but I just don't feel any of that boost in my mood at all. For a while I have been thinking to just end it, the only thing keeping me going is this single online person I have been talking to for a few years, and they are giving me some hope to escape my home, but we would both have to be financially stable enough and that just feels sort of far away.
All the money I have is also spent on this art school, and now on a new computer that can handle things. The world is ugly to me and in my eyes it just will never get better, I don't know what to do and I am lost. Worthy to mention is also that I have never had proper time to get help for my traumas such as being touched several times when I was 7 or other things I am probably forgetting in this moment. My mom is very conservative and doesn't think this is a huge issue, but with the use of the internet I have found it to be a wrong thing that happened and I made an effort to correct her on it, even though she doesn't understand me. The only okay person I have irl is my brother, but I barely meet him now since he has a family and lives farther away, and he along with my dad understood my struggles. Is there a way to find anything enjoyable again? I miss being interested in things and making fanarts of my favorite games, but I just don't even feel like doing even that, though it's summer break. I came here also because I can't afford talking to a therapist, so I at least want to air this out.",1753628146.0,2025-07-27 14:55:46+00:00,2,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1maobv1/how_to_enjoy_things_again/

1mantq8,I dont know what to do,"This is about one of my best online friends, im embarrassed im coming here for help but i need it. (Also, we're both minors, idk if thats important) My friend is bipolar and has tried to kill themself nearly every single night, since timezones are a thing (im 3 hours ahead) im not awake to say anything to them when they feel this way, i want to start setting alarms for 3-5am to check up on them and to try and help, but i just feel as if my words dont have enough meaning to save their life, or im scared i will say the wrong thing. Ive sent long messages to them before and it seemed to kind of help, but i feel strange saying the same things over again. Maybe i just expect my words to cure their depression (obviously not how that works ik). They also dont have much of an appetite and i feel so horrible that i dont know what to say to help them with it. I need them here with me so bad and i just dont know what to say to them, mainly about the problems theyre going through, i want to offer advice but i have none. I wish i could be with them in real life to take care of them or just hang out. Im an artist and i have hopes that me drawing things for them will make them a little happy but i feel that is a weird thing to assume. The horrific things they do to themself or say what they will do to themself is so scary, i need them to stay here. Their support irl is bad, they say such evil things to them and dont try to help enough.

I also feel horrible for not knowing WHY i need them here. Youre funny and caring and make me happy, but it feels selfish to say that. I think i feel this way about all my friends, not knowing why i need them but knowing that i do just need them

I know how insane this is about to sound but the movie interstellar genuinely got rid of my suicidal thoughts and gave me a whole different mindset on life, but i cant just tell my friend ""life is beautiful and youre here so just do something with it"" because the problem is deeper than just mindset.

They just find life pointless, how do i help them?

1mantno,"I grew up alone. No dad, no real mom, no love. Just surviving.","I don’t even know why I’m writing this, maybe because I got no one else. No friends, no real family, no one to talk to. Since I was 10 years old I’ve been on my own, literally. They put me in a boarding school, from 10 till 18. in a boarding school No love. Just rules, pressure, silence.

Never had a father figure. Dude was gone before I could walk. Never met him, never seen him, never heard from him. Just a name. Nothing else.

My mom? She was there but not really. Toxic. Controlling. Always making me feel like shit. Treated me like a problem instead of a son. Always yelling. Sometimes even hitting. I never felt safe around her. When I started working, I had to give her my money. Never got to buy things for myself. Never had something that was really mine.

I grew up around people who smiled in my face but hated me behind my back. Got used, lied to, ignored. No support. No one ever checked in to ask if I was okay. I had to teach myself everything. How to be a man, how to survive, how to stay strong. I built my discipline by myself. I failed, I got back up. Alone.

Right now, I’m 18. I’m in Turkey. Came here to visit my mom, thought maybe I’d feel some kind of connection. But it’s the same bullshit. She goes out eating with my sister, doesn’t even ask if I’m hungry. I’m home alone, no one cares. I’m done. I want to go back to Belgium, hustle, keep my head down and focus.

My room isn’t filthy, but is in need of a thorough sweeping and mopping. I need to do laundry. I need to brush my teeth. I need to organize things. I need to fix my bed and dust. 

The only safe haven I have is at work and even then I get so few hours now. I hate being at home. I love working and keeping my hands busy. But outside of that obligation so I can pay rent and afford basic things I don’t want to do anything. 

I want to read books I bought that I’m genuinely interested in but I can’t motivate myself to look away from my screens. 

I’d go to the library or somewhere but I’m too anxious to go anywhere too. I have a touch of anxiety going places I’m not 100% familiar with, and again, I just wanna bed rot. 

Doesn’t help that I just broke up with my girlfriend. Admittingly, she was a major source of my anxiety and self esteem issues. In retrospect breaking up was a good thing for myself, but I’m still sad about it. I also found out she also cheated on me, so that’s what’s hurting too. 

I feel like garbage. I’m having a chronic pain flare with a GI flare, I’m coming out of a severe migraine. I’m exhausted. There’s no such thing as enough sleep for me.

1man3cz,rant abt my shitass life,"idk who i can ever say this to so hi reddit heres a rant about my  life.

Ive been going to bed feeling purposeless almost every night since the start of this year. I thought i got my life together since in sec 2 i was kinda messed up in the mind and i somehow got better over the hols? Cuz uhm before i fell off (sec 3) i was also not doing well mentally but ok! Like over the post eoy holidays i somehow got back to going church and everything seemed fine but here i am complaining abt my life. 

Honestly my life seems like something that some people wld wish to have. Im doing alright in terms of grades (falling off tho) and i have a respectable leadership role in sch. i dont have financial problems and my parents arnt abusive and shi. I have q a big social circle and everything as well. 

but i cant help but feel this way. Im stressed reddit💔 my workload for leadership work is flipping balls. I have a large social circle however, i dont even consider these people as friends. Theyre like barely there in my life and we lwk only talk in school. Ive started to not do my hw due to the the amount of leadership and cca work i have that has been overpowering my mental capacity and IK IM COOKED. yeah and that led to the ripple effect in me not doing as well as i can i sch. People set so many expectations on me and tbf i was fine with it but it gets so overwhelming. Like im only known for this one thing and if i act out, they start criticising me. I hate the fact that I go to school pretending to fw some of this people. I hate pretending to be kind and tolerating every bs i hear. I hate putting in so much effort to not even get my work recognised, and i hate that i dont have the mental capacity to focus on my studies w wtv is going on.
Ive been sucking it up, and ngl it has been working because no body knows im suffering THAT much ykwim? everything is js like building up. 
ive been living life on auto pilot, and when things grt hard, ive js been crying it out at night. I wonder how long more i can do this. I dont consider having anyone to tell this to. i do have a best friend but shes lwk bipolar and like she flipping lashes out at me if smt doesnt go in her favour so like i wldnt trust her w my emotions at all. im like living life on hot coal man. i wanna improve but i cant. Ik my WAs are coming and im supposed to study, but my mind is still stuck on certain things and it gets so bad to the point I cant even bring my self up to do it and procrastinate instead. like ik what i have to do but i dont hear the nagging voice at the back of my head anymore. like come on, even my own conscious thoughts have abandoned me. 

my family situation is ehhhhhh. i have no relations w my sibs or parents. i love my mum but she really really isnt there in the emotional aspects. i dont see myself talking to them or anything but like my dad is kinda judgmental and he has anger issues and shit so idw to mess w him. and my mum, shes js too bz to care. My sibs are in their own worlds so it rlly feels like im alone sometimes. 

I wanna sleep so bad. and actually sleep. idk whens the last time ive done that. im either sleeping like 4 hrs or an excessive 10 hours (when i js crash and take like 3 hour long naps). i have not been doing my hw(js math lwk) and ughhh i js feel like its so hard to start :(

Ive tried and tried to pray over it but im kinda losing both motivation and patience man.. God has been so silent. and i try but ts is NOT WORKING. And this isnt the first time ive been ""depressed "" its alw like terms in a year type shit. but when i think im gettign better, i fall back into it again. like omds i hate my life mate💔 i dont have the desire to end it or anything but i js feel soooo shitty. but at the same time, my life isnt that bad you feel me? everything is moving so slowly and i js want to disappear. guys i want a hug frm smb but idk how i can even get that. I dont even knwo how to communicate my emotions and feeligns to people anymore (thats why im here). i cant set boundaries for shit and when I do try to talk to someone, i feel so inferior because all they do is js try and give me solutions while dissmissing wtv i feel.  i feel numb and like ughhhh idk how to say it. and whats worse is people view me as this whimsical retard rhats supposed to be happy all the time. its so awkward when im sad man cuz tjey rlly dk what to do and i dont blame them. ZZZ AND WHATS IRONIC IS YK THE LEADERSHIP ROLE I WAS TALKING ABT?!? IM LITERALLY HEAD OF STUDENT WELFARE IN MY SCHOOL. OMDS and im here crashing tf out..

I js wanna improve my life. how do i start? how do i js start afresh? how can i do better in school despite all my emotional nerfs and workload. 
idk man IDK HELPP ME REDDIT I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE. shld i js isolate and attempt to fix my life? 

also ik the points are messy and like some of trhe shit i saw do NOT make sense. im sorry for those who stayed and read this abomination 💔💔",1753625019.0,2025-07-27 14:03:39+00:00,1,2,depression,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1man3cz/rant_abt_my_shitass_life/
1man0ra,My Depression,"Hello everybody. I am new to reddit, and am coming here to seek... I'm not sure. I guess just an area where I can vent, with people who can understand. 

  
I'm 24, and around 3 years ago. I met my now ex-boyfriend. Genuinely... He was such a beautiful human being. He uplifted me, and he made me feel understood and loved in a world that felt so cold and isolated. But I didn't understand him, and constantly, I made his also present mental illnesses worse due to my emotional immaturity, as well as social awkwardness. He stayed patient, and tried his best. But the last 5 months, had been the worst that it was. I eventually grew into a physically abusive boyfriend, and started hurting him. He stayed still, and we even planned to get engaged. But everything finally ended, and due to a misunderstanding, I ended up assaulting him one more time, resulting in such grave injuries that he had to be sent to the hospital for recovery.

  
All of his friends know, and I am now vilified within my city as word spreads. Rightfully so. I was not arrested, as he took pity on me. He tried to stay my friend, and even stayed intimate, but despite the meds, and support I got, as soon as they wore off a few days ago, I ended up assaulting him again, as I broke into his house, sabotaging a call he had a with someone he was trying to meet casually, while cutting myself as I begged him to please pay attention to my emotional needs, as I felt them neglected, and forced my way in as he tried to call the cops.

  
Again, he didn't continue to press the charges.

  
After everything, my life has really fallen apart. What little support I had from some of his friends is now turned into genuine disappointment. I can't help but feel that if I had gotten therapy and support sooner, long before I met him. Things would have been different. Things really were special between the two of us, and I genuinely can't see anybody ever coming afterwards that won't make me feel like I'm settling for less. Or worse. Me constantly comparing a person who I'm sure loves me, to somebody who no longer does, and rightfully so. 

  
I ended up getting diagnosed with Severe Agitation-Depression in the words of the doctor (mix of anxiety and depression), Anger Management Issues and ADHD as I expressed all the symptoms. Difficulty of emotional and physical impulse control. Spiraling thoughts, tightness of chest, self harm leading to possible suicide.   
  
Tomorrow. I am getting my full diagnosis, and then my family is taking me away from the city to hopefully give me an environment with better peace of mind, while monitoring me. They have been very supportive despite knowing what I did, and I thank my sister and father in particular because I trust them the most with everything going on. 

  
I tried making friends earlier, after the doctor's visit, and they somehow knew. They said that they didn't feel safe around me, but respected that I told the truth when asked, and I said I respected their choice as well. 

  
Another old friend of mine called me out, saying that if I really wanted to prove that I was getting better, to stop doing these things that I'm doing. Expressing her genuine disappointment, as she no longer wants to support me in anyway. 

  
I want to one day, hopefully, redeem myself. I know I can't be forgiven, or be friends with any one anymore. But I want to look myself in the eye one day, and tell myself ""You made it. It was hard. But you made it. You can live a life now."" 

  
I obviously want my Ex back. We've been through so much together. But I know that's no longer an option.

  
The battle will be even harder, by my own hands. And I must persist. Or I'm going to end up hurting more people than I already have. ",1753624842.0,2025-07-27 14:00:42+00:00,1,0,depression,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1man0ra/my_depression/

feeling lonely even though im surrounded by friends, feeling like theres no one to talk to even though theres people that tell me they care, hating school, not wanting to hang out with friends, not being able to get up to eat, drink, go to the toilet, motivation dropping, overthinking everything.

and to top it all off, i know im just never gonna end up telling anyone so really, it’ll just be another excruciating lonely experience ",1753624091.0,2025-07-27 13:48:11+00:00,1,2,depression,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mamqht/the_feeling_of_knowing_depression_is_coming_back/

1mamkqw,posting this again because idk...it's gotten worse? I had like 3 breakdowns in a single day and I STILL DONT KNOW WHY,"**IS THIS DEPRESSION?**  
  
Um I'm not sure if this is the beginning of depression or not? I want to know whether what I'm feeling is just a teen phase (I'm 17) or actually something wayyyy serious.

So for the past few weeks, I've been feeling like suffocated. Like my chest feels heavy when I'm alone and it's like there's an invisible weight on my body. It's like a lot of stuff is piling up inside of me and what sucks is that I'm not sure WHAT's actually causing this.  
Umm...it's like my body wants to let something out and like I'm STUCK on the stage that you feel right before crying (like a lump in ur throat and all that) but I can't actually get past this.

it's like either you cry, or you dont cry....But I'm stuck somewhere in between. I've had like 3 breakdowns in the last week, it felt good to cry the first time but now, even after crying, I feel like I'm stuck and suffocated.

(I'm sorry if I couldn't phrase this properly, english isnt my first language but I've tried my best T-T)

EDIT: My parents won't take me to a therapist because they think it's just a phase so this is why I'm asking this here sorryyy",1753623661.0,2025-07-27 13:41:01+00:00,3,6,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mamkqw/posting_this_again_because_idkits_gotten_worse_i/

1malqgy,which simple hobbies have helped you feel better somehow?,"i have been in a deep slump lately wherein ive been oversleeping/undersleeping, finding it difficult to get up, struggling to practice basic hygiene, and could only curl up in bed to pity myself. i couldnt find the energy to pick up a book to read, or even play videogames. i usually just distract myself by watching movies and sometimes it does help to keep me preoccupied.

i have recently gone back to working out and it helped me establish a routine and i feel better about doing at least one productive thing in my day. the first day is definitely the hardest but i want to give myself a pat on a back for pulling through. overcoming mental aspect is significantly harder than the physical part. i hope to be consistent this time as exercise is really important in improving mental health.

1makhgp,"done everything ""right"" and still nothing","I guess I'm posting here now- I just got back from one of the worst shifts of my life. not because of the actual work, but because I've been feeling utterly useless and genuinely terrible the past two weeks. I technically work tomorrow, but I'm calling in- I hate doing that, it stresses me the fuck out and fills me with anxiety that I'm gonna get in trouble, but it was the only reason I managed to push through today.

I've been feeling terrible about myself for over a decade, and now that in a little over a month I turn 26, it's all starting to hit me like a truck. I told myself at 18/19, if I was still an unhealthy, non-cute piece of shit who's made no progress towards their creative interests by the time I was 25, I'd call it quits there. well, all those boxes are checked- and add in the fact I can't even play games anymore because I'm so obsessive-compulsive that I'll spend 2 hours fiddling with the settings and opening/closing the game multiple times, along with basically nothing interests me or relaxes me anymore, nothing can get my mind off how shitty everything is, it's not looking good. as a bonus, I still overshare to my friends, whine, have breakdowns and then apologize ad nauseum, say that I hate myself for doing it- and then doing it again, just like I have for years.

cowardice and pain avoidance are the only reasons I'm still here, plus I'd have to write notes for the people I was about to hurt and I just haven't had the drive to do that.

I was recently seen by a psychiatrist for an evaluation and he diagnosed me with ""mild"" adhd, ""mild"" autism and ""mild"" ocd- whatever ""mild"" means, then didn't really elaborate any further, said he'd get me in contact with a therapist and I didn't hear anything else. I'm currently trying to find another therapist, but I've been though dozens and dozens and they all just seem to treat me as ""guy who is a little bummed out- have you tried going for a walk?"" rather than a person with a condition.

that brings me back to the title of the post- even with all this, I've seen therapist after therapist- I DID the thing you're supposed to do, and it didn't help. I just got unlucky, or maybe I'm being shitty and dishonest in sessions- I don't think I am, I'm not trying to- but it's either that or astronomical luck that I haven't found ONE professional I actually trust and who feels like they understand how my head works even a little bit.

I don't know, I'm tired. I can't even handle 3 days/week because I don't know what I'm working for. I just collapsed into bed and wrote this, I probably forgot something important- I don't know what I'm expecting, fuck",1753617477.0,2025-07-27 11:57:57+00:00,2,3,depression,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1makhgp/done_everything_right_and_still_nothing/
1makeq2,I am feeling a lot of different things.,"I have so many disjointed thoughts and feelings right now. 

I feel this darkness over me, it kind of just follows me wherever I go. I am constantly unhappy with myself. 

I feel alone, very alone. Which is wild, only hours ago I was with friends and now I am back home with family. 

I have this really unsettling feeling within me that I am wasting away my life. But I don't want to burden people with this. 

I really hate who I am, and hate who I was.  I try to change who I will be, but who I was has made it really hard to change who I will be. Sometimes I want to smash my own head in. 

I hate the world we are in and how it's geared to benefit people who are already better off. I hate that people are unnecessarily going through pain around the world and I feel how powerless they are in making it better. If I could just quit my job and go volunteer, I would... but unfortunately I will be legally fucked for it.",1753617225.0,2025-07-27 11:53:45+00:00,2,1,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1makeq2/i_am_feeling_a_lot_of_different_things/

I'm fundamentally dysfunctional, came out a bad product long before they labeled me. I don't believe I can get better, because I am the dysfunction.

1majylq,He said im terrorist,"The inner world narrows so that the path to yourself becomes clearer. Everything is uninteresting, out of place - this is a good filter that allows you to immediately see, feel, pay attention to your own. The inner compass must be kept clean and well-coordinated in work. If you leave it in desolation, hoping for someone else's reference point - you lose its purity 

Every time I ignore the signs in order to deceive myself and convince myself that everything is ok, this is the right path. But after a short period of time, reality begins to crumble, and everything is irrevocably destroyed, because it is impossible to live someone else's life. 

My manner is to build in order to destroy, only I do not agree to these buildings; I was like fertile soil for the development of other people's ideas and intentions.

1majtnu,I had depression until I began manifesting and now my life is how and where I want it to be.,"Since being a kid in school, I never had friends or felt as though I was understood by anyone. I ate unhealthy food and cried a lot everyday because I thought it was all my fault, which it was. I pushed people away my entire life and expected people to chase me back but this never happened. When i was 16, I felt something within me searching for something deeper. I began reading  occult and esoteric books when it all hit me, 'we are not here to consume, we are here to create'.  I began being cautious of what entered my five senses and i began repeating affirmation until I became it. Now I have made a life for myself. I no longer feel fear and I no longer value myself based on how other value me. If it wasn't for this manifestation group I joined, I don't know where I would be.

1majjeu,Yesterday I almost did it,"My mother went out to his bf's house and after so many years without this thoughts I seriously thought about killing myself. I think my presence is making everything worse and everything would probably be better if I wasn't here suffering.
I started making a rope with a bunch of clothes I had and when I was making the final knot I started to doubt.
Usually I back down when I start thinking about my brothers, my friends or my dad, but this time it seemed as if it wasn't that big of a deal if I disappear. It seemed as if every bit of sadness that I will create would be worth it because I will stop being a problema to them while stopping my suffering. It's when I thought of my mom finding my corpse hanging in my room that I broke and started to cry in my bed til I fell asleep. When I woke up I didn't want to go though with it.

I just wanted to put it out for someone to read I guess. The love of my life left me, my best friend lied (pretty big lie) to me and I feel incapable to put enough trust in anyone as of right now. It was this or going to a church to see if I could confess or something (I'm not a christian but I thought of it to have someone listening to me (I know it's pathetic)).

I really don't know when it's gonna end this suffering but I don't want my mom having to find my body that way. I just wanted to be happy and for people to be sincere with me...

1maj8gr,I think this year is going to kill me,"Everything I thought I knew and built up, everything I thought I got rid of or buried deep down manifested itself just because I lost someone.

I lost my grandfather a couple months ago and I thought I was okay because I didn’t cry at the wake nor funeral and I got a new job about the same time and I was moving out of my shitty household and felt like I got my ducks in a row.

That was nothing but temporary happiness after a few weeks I forgot to celebrate my birthday because my grandfather died the night before then I realized I lost my closest friend and broke down silently in the middle of the night afraid I was going to wake everyone up and that night I tried self harming for the first time in years but again broke down even harder and passed out.

The past few weeks strangers have called me names probably because I was in the shitty parts of town trying to make my way home and when I got home I broke down and felt stupid crying over something stupid, I feel weaker and weaker with everyday.

I have no friends to ask for help or advice and no family either, all my friends flaked long ago or are too busy with their lives and all my family would just criticize me expect my grandfather but he’s dead I wish I could talk to him one last time to tell him everyday I feel taking my life and everything’s overwhelming and I feel beyond lonely.",1753613106.0,2025-07-27 10:45:06+00:00,3,2,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1maj8gr/i_think_this_year_is_going_to_kill_me/

1maiqyj,Genuinely trying to hold on,"Been trying to hold on for what seems like years. My parents genuinely suck ass, my mom has been in this toxic relationship with her boyfriend. I'd say he's my step dad considering they've been together for like 15+ years but I genuinely hate him. She enabled some god awful shit to happen that fucked me up and literally can say i'm this way because of it. He groped my ex when I simply went to the grocery store to get her a late valentine gift because i didn't have any money. He told me that we can take his car and that I could drive, I was trying to get my drivers permit so it made sense in my head that i could get some practice driving at night. I left them alone like a dumbass. I was 15 at the time and that was the first time i finally understood the kind of person he was. I blame myself for letting that happen and honestly didn't know how i didn't pick up the signs that something was clearly fucking wrong. You'd think the police would get involved and you're wrong, bitch managed to evade that talk with the police, dont ask how because to this day im still asking myself that. Once I turned 18 i left home for 2 years, and during that time it felt like I was doing ok for once. Even with me leaving the house, my mom's boyfriend still tried to keep in contact with me. I tried to ingore him the best i could. At this point I lost the majority of my friends, I used to have my best friend but I genuinely don't know what happened between us. I don't think he understood what I was going through despite him seeing that I've gotten in a fist fight with my mom's boyfriend. I say he never understood because he told me to ""get off my high horse"" when I went through a depressive episode. Literally try to make sense of that, I've never heard anyone say that expression to be used as a way to ""make me feel better"" like he tried to explain to me. At the same time he was the one that got upset at me for getting into a relationship at the time, genuinely just tried to live my life and shoot my shot to the girl that I liked and had to throw a little baby tantrum and call her slurs anytime we were together because he felt like we weren't talking anymore even though we were basically neighbors. Why do people have to be that way, what do they gain? Does it make them happy seeing someone struggle. It feels like im going insane. I want to scream and cry but I can't even do that. I dont have anyone really to talk to but when i do it's just the same script very time ""you're not alone, you're going to be ok, things will get better,"" I'm getting tired of hearing that honestly, like no it's not I've been trying get better, it's not like im sitting on my ass all day hoping that something will happen. I don't blame them though, I know they can't understand. I know i dragged this on for a bit and probably doesn't make sense at this point but i completely lost hope in people, the one who i thought was my mom never protected me, my friends weren't really my friends. I'm just aimlessly doing shit at this point. If I do end up offing myself then that's ok, and if not that's ok too. Either way it doesn't make a difference.

Im in bed right now writing with tears wondering why I exist.

I should be happy and going outside with my friends instead of staying up all night crying about my life going downhill.
Im soft hearted but who cares in this generation am I right? If I actually talked to someone about my life problems same age as me they would just laugh and tell me to go through it.

1mahsoo,Lonely.,"I’m so lonely I want to kill myself. 

I haven’t got a single friend, for years I had two long term friends, one of 25 years and the other 15 years. That came to an end at the start of the year due to differing opinions on my partner. 

One friend, I suppose was like the ‘leader’ of the trio, let me know she was stepping away from the friendship, I’d known her since I was 7 years old, I’m now almost 33. I thought we would have known each other for life. I loved her so much that I’d always wanted to name a daughter after her should I ever had one. Maid of honour at my wedding. That kind of thing, she is a truly effervescent person that lights up a room when she walks in. 

The second friend I’d known since high school, her family took me in when my parents divorced and I had no where to live because my dad moved OS and my mum became an alcoholic. She never said anything to end the friendship but she just kind of disappeared. My texts went unanswered, always too busy. Equally as kind and radiant of a human being. 

I have my partner and he is there for me, but I have zero female connection and friendship. I work in a tech company which is almost entirely males minus a couple of much older women who work in the accounts division. 
I have put myself out there trying to meet people at special social meet ups for people looking to make new friends (which was painful as someone who is very shy but I tried my best) no one wanted to get my number/stay in touch. 

My partner and I are on a holiday for a milestone birthday with his group of friends, while I’ve felt the way I am for some time, I feel seeing him with all his long standing friends catching up having fun, and then their partners all arranging to go and do ‘girl things’ while the guys are off doing their stuff, makes me feel like such an outsider, a leper, waste of a life, I am so lonely. 

My son started school this year and I thought it could’ve been a great opportunity to make friends with other mums, at school drop off/pick up I always smile and acknowledge people politely but living in a diverse community where I seem to be the odd one out when it comes to culture/background I feel has hindered my ability to become casually friendly with anyone as English isn’t even commonly spoken amongst the mums, they seem to speak in their native languages. 

I am engaged and outside of my brothers and parents I don’t have any guests to invite to my wedding. The whole wedding will be my partners large family and various different friend groups. I feel like such a loser. 

I suspect I could possibly be somewhere on the spectrum, I was so shy when I began school, I did things ‘different’ and once I became old enough to realise that was what was making me stand out I began mentally taking note of how everyone else did things/what they wore as a way to fit in.  I don’t know that being assessed would make any difference to my no friends situation. 

I don’t know what my point is behind writing all this out and I don’t know what I think anyone could even offer me in response, I’ve never said any of this out loud, I think I had to get it out because the longer I keep it in it feels like a knife imbedding itself deeper into my chest. 

Sincerely, 
Square peg in a round hole. ",1753607442.0,2025-07-27 09:10:42+00:00,1,0,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mahsoo/lonely/
1mahrbi,Is my life all that bad compared to others? It's long I know just read if you can.,"I'm a 14 year old boy who grew up in Jamaica but currently lives in the US. I'm gonna start off with my life In Jamaica and how it went. I went to a private school that was really good but most of the schools in Jamaica are really good anyway and when I first arrived at the school in kindergarten I was very introverted and was adjusting to the school experience and I didn't have any friends but I talked to people from Time to time. Fast forwarding to the first grade I made some friends who were mostly boys with some girls but it was a great time not to mention the teacher was just amazing. Then COVID hit and we did the whole online class thing but something changed In me I became much more lively and expressive for some reason the we went to the 4th grade and then I started bonding with everyone I didn't get to know before COVID especially the girls. Fast forward again to the 5th and 6th grade I was literally friends with everyone in my class and I was well known across the school I was smart,funny and my looks were average and I was really short which always bothered me. I was top of my class and getting along with the hottest girl in my school who just broke up with her boyfriend so it was perfect. I was really bonding with her and was planning to confess but I didn't because I got hit with the news that that I was moving to the US permanently. This made me sad because I tried really hard to make sure I passed for the top high school and we were going together but that dream was crushed. I never saw any of my friends again and I moved to New York and I was adjusting to the new school making friends but I was not well known like my other school and I didn't talk to any girls. I was one of the top students in my school again but I was told we had to move again which really pissed me off at this point and I was sad. I lost my good friends two times now and I moved to a new school in Connecticut and it was frickin terrible the kids were mean and completely unapproachable,the teachers couldn't teach at all and I was getting bullied but it wasn't extreme. I struggled to keep up with my expectations because up until this point I was a genius but I kept getting dumber and dumber and my friends were not really that good, they're good people but I didn't feel that connection I normally feel. On top of this my acne was really bad so I was looking terrible and my personality went back to introverted again I hated myself a lot. It was all too much and I broke down mentally and I hurt myself sometimes and say really bad things about myself. I don't feel much emotion for some reason too I still feel the occasional sadness and hatred towards myself but I can't cry. I'm starting to think I might be becoming psychotic and a find myself lieing alot and losing my ability to understand people's feelings. Also throughout all of this I was dealing with a back problem that made my life terrible random sharp pains, tingling feelings and more. I've started watching a lot of porn for some reason and I don't know why.

1mahgx6,Isolating myself is hurting my husband. I need some advice.,"Lately, I’ve been going through intense mood swings and probably the worst depressive episode of my life. Sometimes it’s really hard to see the good around me and I just feel so angry, sad, and overwhelmed. I’m working with a therapist and I usually journal and these 2 things have helped me tremendously in the past. 

I got married to my husband 2 months ago and in our culture, marrying someone is the only way to be in a romantic relationship with them (romantic relationships outside of marriage are heavily frowned upon). I’ve only known him for a month before that and we don’t really have much in common despite being from the same hometown. 

I initially rejected the marriage proposal because I knew that I wasn’t in a place to be considering anything romantic because of how bad I’m struggling with my mental health. We also don’t have anything in common and I really don’t have much energy to work on connecting with someone so different from me. But my family worked really hard to convince me that the guy is great (which he is!) and that I should give things a shot.

I eventually agreed and I mentioned to my husband that I’m really struggling with my mental health. He told me a lot of sweet things like “we’re in this together” and that he would like to help as much as possible. 

My husband is a really sweet and caring guy. He’s extremely sensitive to people’s emotions and is able to identify mood swings very easily (he has previous experience working with mentally ill patients as part of his occupation). 

I still felt like the marriage happened so fast and after the marriage, my husband would constantly show up with flowers, ask to spend time together, and tell me how much he cares about me. For some reason, this drove me right into a terrible depressive episode. I felt like I didn’t want to see him. I didn’t want to share my time with him. And I just wanted to be left alone. 

I started feeling so hopeless and suffocated. I stopped taking care of myself, and I started acting cold towards him and distancing myself from him. I don’t know why I do this but every time he reaches out or shows a sign of affection, I recoil and I isolate myself further. It makes me want to rip my skin out. 

This has been driving me absolutely crazy. I’ve lost so much hair. I’ve almost completely lost my appetite. And I’ve been having suicidal thoughts regularly. 

Yesterday, we went out and he told me that he’s been feeling hurt about how I’ve been shutting him out. He told me that he’s been noticing my mood swings but he’s been ignoring them out of care. He told me that he’s here for me and that he wants to work through things with me. But he just feels like we’re so distant. 

I apologized to him and I told him that my thoughts are really dark and hurtful. And that I don’t want him to be exposed to them. I told him that I have a lot of baggage to work through and that I find it really hard to connect with people. 

I told him that I might not be able to meet his emotional needs and that he should think about whether he wants to continue being in this relationship or not. I don’t even have romantic feelings towards him and I don’t know how much longer he’ll be able to handle my behavior. He shouldn’t make himself feel responsible for it. 

Idk if I’ll ever get better, and I don’t think this is fair. He doesn’t seem to want to leave but he’s extremely hurt and upset with my actions. Should I pull the trigger and leave? My friends and family all love him and think that he’s an amazing guy. I just feel like he doesn’t deserve to go through this. I don’t want him to go through this. I need to get my shit together. 

He wants to talk again later tonight but I don’t know what to say or what to tell him. I can’t give him false hope and promise him to get better and step up because what if I don’t? 

I just need some help navigating what to say. I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

I've suffered from depression for atleast 20 years,  so it's not new, and I know that I will eventually stop feeling so terrible for a while,  but right now I just feel hopeless.

I have stopped taking my medication and I know that taking it again will probably help.  (In like a month when it finally gets back into my system) I'm just like paralyzed by inaction.  I guess knowing that it won't do anything immediately makes it harder.  And maybe part of me doesn't want to take care of myself and that part is winning? Ugh idk. 

I also missed my last appointment with my therapist and now she's on vacation and the next appointment she has available is in a month, which feels completely useless to me now. 

I am approaching (in?) peri menopause and I strongly suspect that there's hormone stuff going on that's exasperating my depression.

I really should go to the doctor,  but I'm paralyzed and overwhelmed.

Just to be frank, I don't know if I am depressed, if I am right on this subreddit, but the past few days have been tough. It's the first days since around a year I don't really have anything besides the cycling to distract myself with. No computer games, no work to throw myself into, no friends that occupy my time. Just me, myself, and I.

And I don't know how to handle that at the moment. I wanted this trip to get to know myself again, to learn what I want from life. But at the moment I just feel empty, could not tell you what I am actually feeling, no idea. I am going through the motions, waking up in the morning, making coffee and breakfast, riding through utterly beautiful nature, and it just leaves me cold.

No idea how to describe it more. I'll definitely want to get some therapy when back home. But I also don't want to cancel the trip, I still think it should be good for me and it's better than sitting in front of the computer back home. 

What do I want from this post? Ranting a bit, definitely.

1mafx6w,"My life is shit, from the start to now.","
I was born in Irkutsk on March 24, 2009.
My mother works at a shoe store, nothing extraordinary, but I guess it was enough for us. My father was absent during my early childhood, he left the family, he didn't know i was born after i was a few years old, and his departure left a mark on me. When I was little, he came back a few times, but his depression, probably worsened by the death of his second wife and his second son’s suicide, made it impossible for us to connect. Each time he returned, I felt more disappointed, and the last time I saw him was last christmas, and honestly, I find it hard to communicate with him even now.

Outwardly, I was always quiet and calm, but inside, I was quite closed off. My mother says I grew up very uncommunicative and aloof. When guests visited, I’d prefer to hide in my room rather than face anyone.
 As a kid, I often got caught painting walls at the entrance of our house. That probably sounds rebellious, but I think I was just trying to cope with my feelings somehow. In elementary school, I had a friend named Artur Lysenko who helped me get along with others. He treated me like an object sometimes, but he helped me adapt. I couldn’t refuse or say no back then. I didn’t know how. My mother had to teach me to say “no,” and once I learned that, I stopped being friends with Artur. Looking back, I think I realized that those friendships felt fake anyway.

Before fifth grade, I was a good student, participated in creative contests, and made commendations. My hobby was video games. But later, I moved into a math class because I scored high on tests. Still, my mother later said the other kids didn’t accept me. I met a boy at Artur’s birthday party. By then, I was in a deep depression, and I just trusted all my problems to him because he supported me. Over time, I started losing friends because he didn’t get along with others, and his unfriendly attitude rubbed off on me. I didn’t really care; I thought my previous friendships were fake anyway.

Meanwhile, Artur said in my room that I lost friends because I changed quickly, I’d come to school, not greeting anyone, and just shut myself off. He said I was jealous of classmates from richer families. I suppose that’s partly true. I was bullied because I didn’t socialize well and didn’t fight back. Instead, I’d answer “die,” which earned me the school nickname “Jimbo”, a reference to a cruel character from “The Simpsons.” Honestly, I think I was just overwhelmed and didn’t know how to handle the bullying.

I formed a band, which deliberately aimed to offend with its lyrics and song titles, something inspired by the American grindcore band Anal Cunt. Few people knew about my music because I never outwardly showed signs of aggression or interest in heavy music. I was often seen as someone who couldn’t stand up for himself and was easily pushed around. My dependence on the computer is pretty intense; it is my only friend  and I am very reliant on him.

In eighth grade, I started skipping school, and I was expelled after nine classes. I then tried college twice, once in energy and once in construction. I was expelled from the energy college for failing. In construction, I had a conflict with classmates who bullied me, and I stole from a classmate’s house in retaliation. My mother filed a police report but withdrew it later, probably because she was worried about me ending up in prison. After that, I just stopped going to school altogether.

As a child, my mother and I attended church for two years, and we were baptized. But over time, she paid less attention to church, and I began to reject it myself. I dabbled in music, painting, and kickboxing at different times, but eventually, I gave all that up and spent most of my free time online. I think I had a lag in my psychological development from childhood. Psychologists even advised my mother to give me more freedom, but as I grew older, I started to feel ashamed of her and avoided her at all costs.

Looking back, I can see how all these experiences shaped me.",1753600087.0,2025-07-27 07:08:07+00:00,1,0,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mafx6w/my_life_is_shit_from_the_start_to_now/
1mafpp2,considering suicide,I'm a minor but I lost my mom and my dad turned to drugs and the rest of my family sucks. I only have one friend that I've shared suicidal thoughts with and they have helped but I can't be dependent on just one person as I don't want them to feel pressured. I don't want a relationship with any of my family I just want friends but I can't get friends unless I go to school. I'm terrified for when school starts again because of all the stress of having to find my classes and for when I find out my schedule because I absolutely can't do any electives since I'm too unmotivated but I'm forced to and I'm hoping I get art even though I hate art but it's better than the others and I trust the teacher. I actually wish I was never born and I'm considering suicide. I have no reason to stay alive I just want out.

Theres just so many reasons why things hurt and the longer this goes on the more things that pile up. Not only that but the sh and attempts that I’ve had also weigh on me and my current mood too. I hate it because it’s a collective of everything, but it’s so many things I feel like I can never truly talk about it.

1maf5r9,I suddenly feel so disconnected from people I used to love,"I (22f), as a kid, was super shy and introverted. When I was 18, I somehow learned social skills and became an extravert and was suddenly able to make friends. I really prided myself on making so many deep connections, and it really became a reason for living for me. (I probably relied on these connections too much.) I had several ""best friends"" at a time. I truly only felt happy around my friends, and when making new ones.

About a year ago I went through a really hard time because I lost some two important friends within a few months of each other, including my very best friend in the whole world. (My friends didn't die, they just didn't want to be friends anymore.) I was inconsolable for months. After that I became increasingly withdrawn, and now I don't feel connected to anyone anymore. I don't feel any joy when I'm with my friends. I feel either numb or agonizingly sad all the time. I used to feel so much hope when I was with them, and now I feel nothing. I can't tell if it's because we've outgrown each other, if I need new friends, or if I'm just numb.

I also feel unable to make new friends. Suddenly I'm awkward and have no idea what to say to other people. I have none of the charisma or humor I once had. Speaking to new people (or any people I guess) now takes so much out of me, and I always feel so awkward so I barely even try.

Nothing matters to me anymore. I try to feel happy, but it only lasts for a few days and then I'm sad or numb for a month, then 1-3 good days, etc.

I have also been single my whole life and I am very, very sad about it. I have been rejected over and over again and I just want love. It's so painful. This doesn't help my social skills. It feels pointless for me to talk to guys because they're just going to reject me either immediately or after a few dates.

1mac9zy,I am scared it’s too late,"I am 20 with autism, ADHD and severe depression. I have never been to school and stopped learning school work in 3rd grade (I don’t know why but my parents stopped teaching me) 

During my teen years I stopped all activity outside the house, no going to school (I was too behind) and no trying anything new because I was struggling heavily with social anxiety and have been dealing with extreme crippling body image issues since I was 10. 

I grew a lot during 17-19 and gained a lot of much needed social skills, experience, and confidence (more than I had before). But I am still years behind where I need to be.

I am somehow starting college now with hardly any prior schooling or experience and everything in my life feels so utterly hopeless. I have terrible comprehension and don’t understand near half the things people years younger than me understand. I have felt behind my entire life and ever since I turned 20 my depression has gotten significantly worse because of my age. I never wanted to grow up but having to now be grown and be expected to act my age when I never got to properly grow up leads me to thinking suicide is the only answer (I am too scared to actually do it but I feel like it will happen eventually) 

I feel like I am screaming inside that I need help and that I don’t know what to do (I can’t maintain everyday life tasks, am not smart at all, and have no idea how I will ever support myself independently) Everything in my life feels very heavy for many different reasons and I don’t know what to do it just keeps getting worse and I will be 21 this year and just the thought leads me to terrible places that I can’t ever escape.

I am so scared. I use to have a therapist that I liked and trusted but she thought I needed more help (like an IOP or impatient, which wouldn’t have helped my issues) so I stopped seeing her and finally got to seeing a new one a few weeks ago but I don’t think I click well with them and I just feel like no one understands or even wants to deal with me. I try to explain how I feel hopeless, why I feel this way, hoping to get help but instead it feels like they can’t do anything to help me. I don’t know what to do at this point because trying to handle things alone hasn’t been working. Medication isn’t a good option either. I feel like my problems aren’t serious or real enough for an IOP etc and also wouldn’t help me. I just don’t know what to do I’m drowning and just trying so hard to find someone or something that can lift me up enough so I can just learn how to manage living. I feel so incompetent and helpless. Just so big and ugly and embarrassing.

1mabk73,I don't feel like a real person,"I don't think I really 'exist' anymore. Favorite song? Oh man let me think about it. I have no idea. I don't have a favorite anything. I don't listen to music anymore. There's really nothing of interest I pursue. 

I truly did used to be a talented artist and a smart student. Why can't I be that person anymore? I really can't get back this time. I spend everyday drinking and waiting to die, hoping the strain on my body might cause me to just sleep and maybe not wake back up one day. I'm too scared to attempt suicide, but I do it slowly everyday through insane amounts of drugs and alcohol. It doesn't matter.

I'm not that old but my life was handed to me on a silver platter and I really really fucked it up. So many bad things happened and I couldn't fix it but there were times I really could've done better but I just chose not to, because I know it doesn't matter. 

It really just doesn't matter. It's just people trying to convince each other to stick it out so the other doesn't have to be alone, even though they're too weak to do something about it. Why do we do this? I don't wanna do it anymore. I've stopped participating for years and it's wreaked havoc on me and my family, but what's the point? It does not matter. I lost the things I cared about and my future opportunities. 

People tell me there's always hope in the future, but like no, I really fumbled my only chances at having a somewhat ok future. Some doors slam shut behind you, through time, age and circumstance. 

It just feels like I wait everyday to die and I'm still here. Do I even wanna die I don't know

My therapist was telling me I need to be authentic and unmask and stop “faking happy” but how can I?

I’m happy for my friends and happy when they’re happy and succeeding. But I hate when people ask me about myself. I don’t want to talk about myself. If I talk about myself and be true to myself I’m a bummer, that one downer of a friend where people know somethings up but there’s nothing new to talk about so why ask. Talking about myself and how I REALLY feel is like asking to kill the vibe and make a trip to the psych ward.

I can’t truly tell people how deeply suicidal I am. How I keep googling ways to mix up my meds and just die already. How I scream and cry when I’m in my car bc that’s when I’m alone. They’d be concerned, but little do they know it’s all I think about all day everyday every time there’s a little problem. I know there’s a way out. 

People would tell me to save myself and live but they wouldn’t be able to confront my problems or help. It’s not like I want to help myself either soo 

I just feel like I try so hard to make something of myself yet here I am. I’m not happy. I’m not successful. I’m alone. I feel worthless and hopeless and suffocated and trapped. Having a disability, can’t find a job, and I can’t open up with people. 

I want to vent and be heard and comforted, but opening up just means I’m gonna talk about the same three things are wrong, that have been wrong since last week, three weeks ago, three months ago, last year, whatever. I know people are sick of hearing about it. I feel guilty even talking to my therapist because I’m sure she’s sick of my complaining about the same, unchanging issues that I can’t seem to fix but come back to talk about every week

And honestly, talking about my problems has become less about being comforted and more about validating why my life is horrible and I am built to suffer

1ma9qec,I can't feel love anymore,"Since I dont have many people to love I've lost the ability to give love and experience it for myself. I used to love hugs more than anything in the world and I loved kisses and head rubs etc. 

Since it was never common for me to get hugs and all that I would crave it and when I would get a hug from someone most of the time I would cry in their arms because it felt so good. 

But in the last 6 months I've noticed that I now longer care about being hugged or kissed and that It doesn't feel good anymore. It doesn't feel like anything. I've got no cravings and no care if someone wants to hug me anymore. It does sweet fuck all for me.

I dont even feel like I love any of my family and friends anymore which really hurts. I can't feel any feelings for them anymore and just see them as humans like the rest of us. 

I can't seem to feel the fact that they love me (they are the only ones that do and there aren't many of them) and can't understand why they love me and I keep asking myself why they would want to hug me and give me any love at all because I feel like I dont deserve it. 

I dont even really want to be hugged or kissed anymore which also hurts. Now that I am receiving so much more love than I usually would I can't feel any of the love I am receiving and I dont really want any of it because I feel undeserving of it. I don't even respond well to being hugged or kissed anymore. 

I would usually be fucking amazed when someone would want to give me a hug and I would just want to melt into the person and not want them to let go and I would snuggle in as much as I could but now if someone has their arms out for me I just seem to hesitate and give them a one armed hug and I feel absolutely nothing and it makes me feel like absolute frogshit knowing that it does fuck all for me anymore. 

Knowing that I can't feel love anymore really fucks me up because the only thing that makes me want to stay on this planet is love but since I'm not worthy of it my brain has decided that I don't care for love anymore. It makes me feel like absolute shit and like there's no point in being here now. 

What the fuck do I do now?? I'm so lost. I dont know what to do with myself anymore.

1ma93vn,Burnout,"I am in an in-between stage of my life, problem is I've been stuck here for over a year. 

I grew up as a gifted kid who everyone expected to do great things, most of all I expected that if myself. I had big goals and dreams, and planned a bright future for myself. I got accepted into law school and felt like I finally found my place in the world. My luck, the pandemic started halfway through my first year and my department was not used to teaching digitally. My family was affected by the pandemic in all ways you can imagine; my dad was stuck in another country, when he came back he lost his job, my parents got covid and then my grandpa also died. At the same time I was failing in law school. I had never failed before, I didn't know what that felt like. But then I tried getting my license at the end of covid. I passed my theory test but not my driving test, I failed that one two times. I couldnt handle failing again. I thought I would finally get a ""win"". But I failed. I was morning my grandfather, my degree and the image I had of who I thought I was. I thought I was capable, smart and that hardwork would never fail me but it did. 

Failing at so much in such a short period of time was very traumatic for me, so I gave up driving and focused only on my studies. I fixed my failed exams but still felt like I was behind, like I never could catch up, but I always told myself that when I finally work with law, then everything will fall into place. I will finally do what I love and help people for real. The year after that I had my internship, that is part of your degree. With my luck, I ended up having my internship at a shitty law firm, were they were super unprofessional and barely taught us anything and I hated the assignments and the work. The things I would tell myself, that it would get better once I started working turned out not to be true and my whole dream came crashing down. My only hope turned out to be nothing.

After the internship I had half a year left and I did manage to finish my degree, but I had been talking to a therapist and we came to the conclusion that I was burned out, so I decided to rest for half a year, so I can get better. Problem is after half a year I stated to apply for jobs again but I can't get a job. It's been a year and a half since I finished my degree and although I don't feel burned out, instead I'm now diagnosed with depression. Life feels hopeless. I feel so shitty. It feels like I forgot everything that I learned in school and that everyone has continued with their lives while Im at home, useless.

I picked up driving again, now I need to somehow build the courage and motivation to at least finish my license, but I can't get myself to do it. I'm afraid of failing again but because of my depression I have no motivation or drive to do it. I know if I at least managed to get a driving license, that would help me get a job but also might help my self-esteem and make me feel more accomplished, but I don't know how to get myself to shower or find a will to live, let alone get my driving license.

1ma8y08,Might As Well Give Up,"I'm a 30 year old straight guy, and I've never been in a relationship. Not for lack of trying. I tried everything. I went on apps, I tried going to groups, I tried volunteering. None of it worked. And it's not like I was going for 10s, I went for people I thought were on my level. Still didn't matter.

I have all the cards stacked against me. Autistic, deduct a point. Introvert who doesn't like to leave the house, deduct a point. Ugly, not in great shape, and too lazy to do anything about it, deduct a point. Just barely under six feet tall, deduct a point. Didn't graduate college, deduct a point. No money, deduct a point. Too poor to move out of my Mom's house, deduct a point. Tell me, after all that, what's left? And if you say ""Personality"" or ""You're nice,"" I'm gonna punch a hole in the goddamn wall. Nobody cares if you're nice. If all you have is being nice, you're like the stupid kid who proudly displays his participation trophies. It's not what's inside that counts, it's what's on the outside, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

1ma8rrq,I Feel Like a Bad Boyfriend because I Didn't Understand my Girlfriend's Depression,"I met my girlfriend (33) last summer and it was immediately wonderful. They always say you'll know when you meet the one and I felt that. It was a magical time.

After a few months things started to change. I watched things over months slowly dwindle, the sweet messages, the compliments, the excitement. Soon the physical side was going, she got irritable, she'd think my words or actions meant something negative and wouldnt believe me when i explained what i actually meant. I tried to bring up this change and she was defensive and wed get no where.

Over time as it worsened id bring it up more seriously. She brought up life had gotten worse. She hated her apartment, her job had grown frustrating, and she had gained weight which was making her feel gross. It made some sense but i didnt get why these issues seemed to affect her feelings for me. There was a loop of arguments and me believing she was really not into this anymore.

I apoke to a counselor because i disnt understand why i couldnt communicate. She suggested my partner may have BPD. Suddenly im in that rabbit hole, thinking ive been love bombed and am being devalued. Eventually my girlfriend uses the word depression, i dont know why she never said it before but she doesnt want to talk about it much.

Things get worse and i start to fade. Im tired of the whiplash of seeing my nice texts responded to blandly on and off, my presence seems good or like an annoyance, the romance seems gone and she doesnt seem to care. She tells me its not me but angrily, and i feel unheard, uncares for, and cant see howcthis isnt reflective of me because its taken our relationship. Why apartment and job stuff affects her feelings for me. I cant make sense of it. Breaking up gets brpught to the table multiple times because i cant seem to make her happy and she gets angry i bring it up ao much as if its an abuse tactic when rrally i want to see her smile or know she is even if im not there.

Finally I cant take the memories of meeting the one, with how she is so cold to me. We fought today because I said something loving and she ignored it. Finally she explains that and it clicks, her not feeling warm means she struggles with saying warm things. I cant relate but it answers my question i couldnt seem to get an answer to from her about why it feels like its about us.

I realize when we met, things were good, and this is why it was easy for her to say nice things. Then  she became depressed, which makes it hard to say nice things.From my end I saw happiness, words of affection, and physical stuff decline and thought that meant it was a loss of interest in me.
But its more bad days than good now and that would answer that thing i didn't get, about why it affected our intimacy, about why things that arent about me seem like they are.

But its too late, I've gotten so confused, upset, and I thought bad scenarios. I told her how she used to be, essentially telling her what shes not doing for me, and brought up breaking up. I made her scared and feel bad, when I was just trying every day to make her happy and eventually getting stressed i couldnt. I just thought I was failing. Now I fear she will never look at me the way she used to and im shattered and dont feel like i deserve her.",1753576266.0,2025-07-27 00:31:06+00:00,5,2,depression,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma8rrq/i_feel_like_a_bad_boyfriend_because_i_didnt/

There's a guy who I have a huge crush on. I love his smile, his eyes, and his really kind heart. He knows how I feel but he doesn't feel the same way. 

I'm just about to move away from where I currently live, and I'm going to miss him so much. Knowing that I won't see him for a while is so painful. But I think being near him hurts even more because it kills me to be near him knowing that he doesn't feel the same way. 

I feel so stupid being so upset over him as well. I'm also so worried that I'm going to hurt myself over how I feel. Not just because he doesn't like me back, but because nobody ever has.

1ma8jrm,Sunshine and hot kisses from the sun.,"Does anybody just randomly remember those times when they were a kid and think how did everything go so wrong?

I used to be a cheerful kid growing up, always laughing at the small things, making cringe jokes, playing with friends till your parents come and pick you up.

I used to like going outside.
Feeling the sun touching my skin, laying outside the grass feeling serene whilst listening to the sound nature.

But how did everything go so wrong? How can someone so pure with joy and love turn rotten, hurt and miserable. It fuckin hurts being like this.

1ma8e7v,I needed a hug got a punch instead,"So there comes a story

I was the last children. Born and raised like “You’re weird but that’s just you” 
I grow up moving through my parents houses, mom and dad divorced when I had 6. 
At 10 suffered a sexual abuse cause my mom left me alone with a stranger, cousin of my step dad. Only told her 15 and she goes to the police to press charges. Was the most traumatic thing of my life. She brag and use the situation about it to every fight with my step father who beat my mom. She press charges against him but stayed with him after all. He was a retired firefighter and when he dies she would have a money for her entire life. He dies years ago. 



And we have my father who I stayed half of my life with. He was a very difficult person to have around. Never let chase my dreams. Everything I does was not enough for him. Tried college 2 times but  it wasn’t for me. I couldn’t handle the social situations and overwhelming stress. 
Since teenager times I was suicidal. So depression was a thing and since 16 I take meds. At 18 I transitioned to trans man. (My dad and I never had a conversation about it, he was highly homophobic, he also never told me nothing about piercings and tattles I just shows up with them.) 
I’ve never been close to him to talk about it in a way he not hurt me with words. He work easily do that even in normal conversations. 

When I had 20/21 I got the diagnosis for autism and adhd. 
So I started to keep looking for work with somethings I love, like dog training. I love dogs so was good and it’s my passion. 
And the truth behind it is that I started to train my own service dog. 

I only work from home with graphic design. I wanted to have something to cope in real life. 

But I was never present in family events. Or events at all. 
I was invisible to my family cause I just can’t handle it. 

I was always different. From my other parents and brothers and sisters. 
Never was too lovely with my parents, always have a difficulty with that. 

Growing up, I lived in the apartment that my dad constructed and give to me. There was no rent, I just work hard but never got much money cause I get overwhelmed so only get 3 clients maximum. Get busses and go out is difficult to me. My service dog makes easily but there’s no cure. 

2 yeas ago I neighbour that was like a brother to me call for help in his house and I just go see what he wanted. He locked me in the room and sexual abused me. He also makes me use cocaine and that started a problem in my life. 
Cause I felt less autistic, I felt amazing. 
And I’m getting sober after a year of being addicted. My parents never know about the addiction. I only used in my house. Alone. Just to feel good. 

Some months ago, precisely 5 my dad says to me “you should get another job and do something with your life or when I die you’re gonna became homeless” 
I felt like nothing. Felt like I was a failure. 

Well… there comes the sad part. My dad dies a couple of months. 
The only time he said he loves me was in a hospital bed. And the last thing he said was “I love you, had a good life”

It’s sad cause I ever try makes him proud doing what I’m I does but he never look after it. I was the kid who was trans, and autistic, depressed (he doesn’t understand autism at all) 
I could never really have a conversation with him again about all of these 
I feel like I had so much to talk but I could never. Well, that’s my story. ",1753575111.0,2025-07-27 00:11:51+00:00,6,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma8e7v/i_needed_a_hug_got_a_punch_instead/

I force myself to do everything, otherwise I wouldn't get out of bed.  Sometimes I dont, those days are the worst and the best at the same time.  

I have only myself to blame.  I am the worst.  I deserve nothing, I expect nothing.  

The state in which i exist is no way to live.  This is not life, this is not living.  I just exist.

If I think too hard about everything, I break down and lose control of my emotions.  As a result, I constantly think of nothing but the current distraction which has my attention.  Finding a good distraction is harder than ever these days.  I have almost finished watching the entirety of Star Trek TNG in about a week and a half.

1ma8cy4,Don’t think I’ll survive the night,I don’t think I can take being all alone again tonight with my thoughts racing. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for years but tonight might be when I actually do it. My life will get better for a second just to get even shittier than it was before. It’s been confirmed that I’m a burden. My co-signer said so. And if I can’t find a place before my lease ends in October I’ll be homeless for a third time. I have an eviction on my record when I was living with my mom. I have disabilities so it wasn’t required for me to help with bills. I still had to be on the lease since I was 18. My mom was spending a lot of money on non necessities and thus us getting kicked out. I dont have any family i can stay with and I dont have any friends. I wish I was never born. Now I have to make the few people that care about me sad if I go with my plan. I also have to hope I go to a good place when I pass. I’m tired of being miserable. I’ve been miserable since I was a child because i was bullied and also got brain cancer.

1ma8c92,Please Help Me 😭🙏,"I uploaded this on a suicide community post. I got no responses, but a ton of views. I don't want views, I want help. I need help...

I'm currently a US Marine (21M). I'm going through the administrative separation process for ""condition not a disability"" (that condition being suicidal ideation).

I tried to stab myself back in April, and shortly after my Oscar (the medical evaluation officer) said that I will get an administrative separation because I had suicidal thoughts before my enlistment. I never got to mention to her how my ideation got worse during my enlistment, as I have had these thoughts and terrorizing images in my head during my enlistment, more frequently than I have had them before.

I have to turn in my service, duty, and dress uniforms. I wanted to get married in my dress blues.

My parents are insisting I take a gap year. I don't want to rest, I want to either write my music (I love singing and writing and playing my guitar, and people say I sing great and write good songs, I guess...) or work (I want to get a CDL. $60K is more than enough)

My parents also insist in paying off my debts for me. I'm 21, and want to work. They insist I rest for a year I want to work and pay off my own debts. I'm $4K in debt. $4K I want to pay off myself.

My parents want me to go to college. Curriculums make me suicidal. I started getting suicidal towards the end of high school (not as severe or crazy as I am now in the military) because my parents wanted me to be an engineer. I don't know or care about any of that. They're basically trying to get me to consume a cyanide pill by telling me they want me to go to college.

The Oscar says I won't get VA benefits. I'm suicidal, and I'm in debt, and you won't help me? Am I just cannon fodder and a diagnosis to you?

My girlfriend tries her best to keep me holding on. But I don't want to burden her with worry anymore. I can't dress nice for our wedding that she and I talked about. And I know her children won't want a sorry excuse of a man as their father.

I don't want to leave the military yet. I'm not ready. I want to transfer to the National Guard. But if my DD-214's code says otherwise, then I'm gonna die.

I used to be Catholic. I lost my Faith in God shortly after the Oscar diagnosed me. I believe He exists, but I don't want to follow Him anymore. I wish I still had Faith, but I don't want to believe anymore. I'm too filthy of a soul to seek Heaven's joys. (Also, an elderly atheist man told me to stop conning myself with religion. I guess I'll take his advice, since religion was one of the few things keeping me alive. And I just want to die)

I just want to die. I'm of no value. I want to go to hell. Because pain and torment are the only emotions I feel with what little human emotion I have left. Besides, I don't want to tarnish Heaven with my sinful and disgusted soul. I don't want to go to heaven anymore. There's no redemption for me. I'm about to give up on everything...

I love my parents, my siblings, my girlfriend, my buddies in my unit, and the rest of my friends back home. I don't have an ounce of love for myself. I'm absolutely worthless. Expendable. Just like my NCOs and Staff NCOs treated me as. I just want to die...

If I can't keep my uniforms and marry my girlfriend in them, I'll kill myself.

If I can't find success in my songs, or find a job where I can have my own income, I'll kill myself.

If I can't pay off my own debts with my own money, I'll kill myself.

If I can't stay in the military (retention in the Marines or transition to the National Guard) I'll kill myself.

If I can't get the VA compensation I know I should have, that I know I need, I'll kill myself.

If I step a foot inside of a college or school again, I'll kill myself.

If I can't find God again, I'll kill myself.

If I can't with anything, I'll kill myself. Burn my body, I don't want a uniform on me that isn't mine. I don't want the people I care about suffer anymore with my existence.

I just feel like wanting to die. All my hope is gone...

1ma7tsc,Anhedonia,"This is my third time in the space of a month getting a rejection text after a date. Not a big deal, it happens. But for me it’s emblematic of a deeper issue. A few years ago I would always kill it on dates with a girl I was into, could build a connection and parlay it into a relationship, could be charming and flirty etc. That person’s long gone.

The reason is that I am essentially a walking void due to anhedonia. I think a lot of girls can detect the emptiness instinctively, and also i just treat girls like they’re friends on dates now and don’t escalate. Because I don’t really have the will anymore. My life is on autopilot. When I consider if I’m attracted to girl I have to guess, because I can’t feel it anymore. I used to love romance, sex and dating but now it’s just another chore. Idk why I expected dates to feel some sort of spark with me when I feel nothing at all ever for anything or anyone. You can’t fall in love with a black hole. 

On paper my life’s pretty good. I have lots of good, loyal friends, do fun activities, hobbies, exercise, decent job, I’m even fairly good looking. So I go out with said friends, do some cool stuff, feel absolutely nothing. I do my job, do it well, and feel no pride. I exercise, achieve PBs and don’t care. I can mask to a modest extent- pretend I do have a functioning amygdala and crack the odd joke- from this I’ve thankfully been able to maintain my friendships even though I’m basically a hologram of my previous self at this point. I used to be charismatic. It was supposed to get better as long as I just forced myself to do stuff but it never did. I still do plenty of stuff anyway because I may as well (plus social pressure) but I feel the same after a weekend rotting in bed as I do a weekend full of socialising, exercise and activities- that is to say I feel nothing. It’s been this way for three years now.  I thought dating might help, tried my best but clearly I can’t do it anymore and it’s just a stark reminder of what I no longer am. 

I’ve tried everything under the sun- so many meds, supplements, fixing my life, therapy. Im always searching for something that can help. I’m not typical for a depressed person- I don’t feel sad, i have plenty of energy, I don’t spiral into doom-and gloom thinking patterns, I (bizarrely) even mostly have a positive attitude in my day to day life and take a proactive approach to fixing my problems. I’m just not really there. When I was a teenager I was regular depressed to point of being suicidal, but the crazy thing is - it was way better than this. At least I felt like a human being. Now I don’t care enough about the concept of my existence to even fall into suicidal ideation like I used to. Alive or dead it all seems to be basically the same thing to me. 

I’m 29 now. I just keep going; there is no real alternative. I’m on track to live to old age in this state, a fate that likely would have disturbed my previous self enough to seek solace in the abyss before it came to pass. But I don’t mind much. It doesn’t matter anymore, I died at 26. What will suicide do for a dead man. Regardless, I still don’t feel sorry for myself- I had lot of good times in those 26 years. Traveled the world, climbed mountains, fell in love, fell in lust (a lot), laughed until I cried, cried until I laughed, broke the law, felt free, felt safe. Beautiful moments in a thousand parties, talks with a million intellects and fun with a trillion idiots. At least the time when I could feel the weight of experiences didn’t go to waste. Most squander the life they are given. Many have never lived a life at all. So I can’t really complain, there’s even a small chance one day I’ll be whole again. Even if you have nothing left you can still have hope- well maybe not for me because it’s another thing I can’t feel anymore. I’ll keep fighting anyway.

1ma7eve,I think I am a useless failure,"I am 20f and have done practically nothing with my life. No clubs or extracurriculars throughout my entire highschool and early college career, only coasting through college and struggling to find a part time job because I have near zero experience because I've been socially anxious my whole life. On top of that, there really aren't any redeeming qualities that I have, I'm not particularly fun, smart, outgoing, or attractive. If you were to ask me about any good traits I have I would not be able to come up with any single answer. I am also not good at anything and I dropped most of my hobbies a few months ago because I did not have the energy or motivation to do them anymore. I used to like to draw and sing, doing those things made me happy, but now I feel nothing toward them. Everything basically feels meaningless and my brain seems like its giving up, I find it much harder to think nowadays and honestly I think I might be extremely stupid.

I think that my depression comes mostly from my issues with self esteem, which I have not been able to improve despite trying for years. I have hated myself for so long and have never felt any relief from it. Any effort in trying to improve myself just feels like failure and I want to give up on trying. 

I am also experiencing sleeping issues where it feels impossible to fall asleep at night because my mind is racing with thoughts regarding all my regrets and things I hate about myself. When I eventually do fall asleep I can sleep for 12-15 hours on weekends and days I do not have class, and on the days I do have commitments and only get 7-8 hrs, I end up feeling completely exhausted and taking very lengthy naps as soon as I can. The need to sleep all the time is messing me up and I think the oversleeping is impacting my cognition and making me even dumber. I know that this is probably another symptom of depression and it is surely making everything worse. I am currently on wellbutrin for depression and I am not sure that it is helping- I am still feeling the need to sleep excessively and I still have the same thoughts about being worthless. I refuse to go to therapy because I have been in it for 10+ years and haven't gotten much out of it, and going back would just completely wear me out. 

It seems to me like my situation is pretty hopeless right now and that I've sabotaged my chances for a remotely good life because of the years of letting depression control my life.

1ma733i,"I'm tired of wanting to do things and not doing them. I'm tired of having skills and being able to do lots of jobs, but having to do stuff for free, because I am living paycheck to paycheck.","Some context, I am 35 and in my first year of home ownership. I do believe I am suffering from depression (and OCD about a few topics; perception, moral, harm), and will finally be talking to my doctor next week about trying medication. I have also accepted this past year that while not officially diagnosed with it, having support from my therapist, fiance, and trusted friends also in the community, I am autistic. I mention this, because I need VERY specific ""start here,"" kind of directions to do anything, and I NEED TO KNOW that it is indeed the correct direction and that I'm not going to suddenly lose out on a bunch of money, and that the effort will be fruitful. 

There are things I want to do, hobbies I want to get into, initiatives I want/need to take in life, but I just can't get myself to do any of them. I've always taken pride in being a rule follower, doing research ahead of time, etc, etc...yet every time I pursue something, or do something the exact way I researched or was told to, it always seems to blow up in my face or ends up having to cost way more than what I can afford.

I love my current job (just what I do; but in a toxic administrative environment), but again, I'm living week to week. Mortgage and utilities we can keep up on, but that is absolutely it. I'm tired of scraping the barrel week to week after getting a master's degree, ""being a good noodle,"" and doing everything the way I was told/taught to. I need a higher paying job, but I'm in sort of a dead-end position (government contracted work). I have a lot of interests and skills that are worth being paid for: 

My strongest ability is I can teach and instruct anything 1-on-1 and in the classroom (I literally designed an entire class on Entrepreneurship for my work with success that ism now taught across an entire region of my state, and I have ZERO entrepreneurship experience). I just do not like working with kids (and parental politics) so I won't consider anything K-12 or youth related.

* Public Speaking
* Coaching football (15 years of experience)
* Historical Research
* Writing
* Spreadsheets
* Front-facing/customer-service roles, especially in bars or higher-energy settings

I can do all of these well enough that I'm worth getting paid, but these are not the kind of jobs you can regularly find or are available, or you have to work the wrong hours that you have available. I see things like part time library jobs, but the pay is so bad it's not going to change my situation, not with the amount of home repairs I need to make. I really want to get into Organizational Development, but there are no clear-cut pathways and I NEED a specific direction or step one. 

I don't have the patience anymore to do these things for free or on my own time for people. It just causes a loop of temporary satisfaction only to wake up in the same place the next day. I'm tired of it. I know if I don't put myself out there, nothing will happen, but I'm tired from 9+ years of college, then trying to make it in a social-service/non-profit type career (low pay), and now being a home-owner. I don't have the drive or energy to do the networking, the branding, setting up and tracking social media accounts to promote my services, etc, etc. 

I just want for once a true, sure-fire path to do something that I know will be fruitful if I pursue it. I guess it starts with my doctor's visit, but even if that helps, I just don't know where I'm going to find the time I need to pursue my ambitions and be able to provide adequate self-care to prevent burnout...I'm already burnt out.

I'm young (16) and I've lost most of my childhood to it. I've had no hobbies, all I would do is sleep, scroll some kind of social media, maldapitive daydream, maybe masturbate or eat and that's it. It's even got to a point where I couldn't even watch movies or play games without feeling extremely bored, I didn't even go outside or speak to anybody, I was just there. I hadn't done anything but lay in my bed, all those years blended together into nothing, nothing changed, nothing happened. I was in virtual school the entire time up until now and I missed all of my assignments, I had no energy or care to pay attention or do any work so now I'm stuck with a 4th graders level of understanding. I rarely understood anyone's references because I never watched movies, I never played games, I never had hobbies and every time I tried to I couldn't keep interest. I'm only now trying to stop this and get a life, but it won't make up for the damage it'd done, while a lot of people see their childhoods or teenage years as something they miss, I will never miss it.

is it an underlying problem caused by living situation that completely stresses me out subconsciously and consciously? 

it's gotten to the point that any little thing will piss me off. a cord i unplugged fell behind my nightstand? pisses me off. like I expect it to stay right where i want? i drop something, it pisses me off. all only for a second but still why is my first reaction to things like that ""goddammit!""? 

it's like eating me alive and I'm not even sure what it is?

like for example I'm having a good time watching something funny, and my brother comes in and shows me something that normally would have made me laugh and we cut up a bit or something. like he'd wanna show me because my reaction and i make it more fun and everything bc that's just my personality especially with my brother but lately it'll just make me wanna shut down and force a smile? why? like what happened? i want to have fun and be the old me but it's just it don't come out anymore like that? or if it does it feels forced.

main thing im feeling is every little thing irritates me and feel myself on a down slide. like a what happened to me kinda feeling. like ill compare myself to me 6 months ago and realize it wasn't this bad.. do i just need medicine? i don't have insurance so doing so is going to be very hard. idk what to do really.. trying to will myself to not be like this isn't working. i WANT to feel better. I'm not sad, I'm just anxious stressed and unaware of how to stop the down slide.",1753569668.0,2025-07-26 22:41:08+00:00,3,1,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma6hn0/what_happened_to_me/

You can tell me to be more positive or be more grateful, but too much has happened to talk about here.

1ma5l3f,"I want to get worse, but why?","I should be a little clearer. I'm not the ""I want to get worse so people can see my suffering,"" or ""I want to get worse to feel validated in my emotions,"" like people typically say when they don't want to get better. I'd also like to note that I feel like I take this to a more extreme length then others who do say this, I have multiple hospitalizations for mental health, I get myself into bad situations on purpose, I research and discover more ways I can self sabotage, I've been expelled from school, manipulate everyone around me, refused all help offered to me (no therapy, no meds, etc), abuse substances knowing the effects they have, constantly hope things get worse, and probably more. I feel constantly bored and it feels as if no amount of suffering I experience is ever enough, and when I am in some deep dark place I feel like I thrive the best. Like I've never lived until that moment. I'm constantly seeking that feeling which contributes to the self sabotaging I listed before. 

I have very little trauma in my childhood and all the diagnosis I've been given through psychiatrists (I was forced to see) have never really fit. (BPD, no because I'm not some overly emotional fuck who clings to people EVER. Bipolar, me or my family have never noticed any 'mania' symptoms. I have ADHD and that one I 100% agree with) (I also don't tell psychiatrists shit, this is just what they predict from some of my behaviors.). I'm also still a minor so some diagnosis like ASPD are unavailable to me.

I want to suffer, I want to genuinely be unfunctioning as a human being, I want to be looked at like a waste of space and an impossibly curable creature. But what does this stem from? No trauma, no diagnosis that fit, I'm curious as to what makes me the way I am?

1ma5b04,My house is disgusting and I feel disgusting (mention of suicidal thoughts and parental death),"I have been living alone since October and my house is a dirty mess. Every surface is covered in stuff, there's no proper place for anything. There's smelly trash, smelly dishes, I smell... In the very few times that I go outside it's like I can still smell it.

I've tried just shoving everything into boxes that I could then unpack like I was moving, but it only made a bigger mess.

I can barely stand to get up most days and then I avoid doing things because of the state my house is in, but the house is in this state because I avoid doing things.

I stopped showering for weeks because I just feel dirty all the time anyway.

I can't just do one thing at once or put away one thing a day or whatever, because there's no place to put it away in. The drawers where the clothes should be are full of crap, the clothes are on the couch and the shelves. The things that should go in the shelves are somewhere else and so on and so forth.

When I was young, my dad, who was the only person I lived in, had depression and we went through a period of about 5 years where this happened too. It got very bad. Then we moved in with his new wife and I managed to make myself have a routine. I went in the extreme opposite direction.

Then they divorced and we moved away when I was 18 and the house was messy again, but nothing like before. We just weren't the tidiest people but it was okay enough. He passed away 2.5 years ago and my mom immediately mom moved in with me to get out of her relationship. And suddenly my house wasn't mine anymore because my mom invades every space she's in, she knows best, she does what she wants.

And in October she moved away, and now I've been living alone.

The house is not big enough for two people, but it was okay with me and my dad because we don't have a lot of stuff. My mom did and it was like a hurricane coming in here and when she left it was all chaos and I haven't been able to fix the chaos, I've just made it worse.

With my history though, is living in filth really the depression or is it just who I am? Because I don't seem to be able to do anything in a functional way. I feel disgusted, ashamed, and I have no idea what to do. I want to kill myself like 80% of the days so why would I even care about having a clean space? I can't do the most basic shit in life, so why live at all?

I am stuck, this is agonizing, and I don't think a clean house would resolve all my problems or my mood, but it would make me feel less pathetic for sure.",1753566510.0,2025-07-26 21:48:30+00:00,3,3,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma5b04/my_house_is_disgusting_and_i_feel_disgusting/

yesterday my mom told me to do the dishes,but i was too tired to even get out of bed,they were lunch dishes and the only meal we have since we dont have dinners (our financial status is good),my mom told me to also mob the floors and clean the cooker/stove
when she woke up today at 6am (we have breakfast at 5 pm because she doesn’t wake up until that hour) and she found the kitchen still dirty.she hit me so hard in the head that my hairclip literally broke IN MY HEAD.the hairclip that i wore even when i slept and didn’t get broken,got broke.and as it shattered to pieces in my hair,my mom told me that “i was a punishment sent from god” and that” i was a loser” and didn’t deserve friends or love,she also told me to kill myself! but she also told me to “kill myself in a mental hospital because she didn’t want to even see me or have any responsibility towards me”
my dad,the one that never gets angry at me,hearing her shouting and rage,also told me to kill myself.
i would,i truly would.but my religion says that people who die killing themselves go to hell,and although that might seem ridiculous,but i don’t think im risking it,im scared to risk it in the afterlife too lol.
i dont know why im posting this,it just hurt me so bad,i dont feel like living.
im also diabetic,which makes me think i really should kms,especially because i STRUGGLE with my diabetes,i truly do.
nobody ever understands me and i know my friends hate me and so do my parents,i hate myself too.

Yet I have everything to be happy but I can't do it. I could do anything to go back to the time when I was a child.

I have in mind my daily life without anxiety, my entire family, joy and so many memories that bring me serenity and calm.

Today I only listen to music from my childhood, films from my childhood. 
I want to go back to that period so much that I'm obsessed with it 

I remember everything I had that I no longer have now.
I can't get out of this period and when I think that things will never be the same again, I really want to end it so I can stop suffering.

1ma3b5j,It is just too much man...,"Im 21 M and im just hopeless in this moment. Theres just too many things happening and i dont know how to deal with them honestly.

Im a med student and i have a job so i can support myself. Unfortunately I have to change my place of living, since some people are leaving, but i just cant find a place that i can afford. Unfortunately I dont get much action at work as a masseur, because there just arent many people coming in, and my boss is giving the clients to a coworker, who is his relative.

My parents are getting a divorce, and my father is dumping decades of trauma on me. I want to help him, since i love my dad, but i just cant really take much more.

And I feel the loneliest ive ever been, I just found out that the girl that im talking to, with whom i am so compatible, we trust each other, she tells me that I am the one that gets her the most, and we text and call almost every day... Well, she has a partner, who acts like an asshole towards her, treating her like dirt. And i know its hurting her bad, which hurts me too, since i cant really do anything about it to help her.

And as if that wasnt enough, everyone, and i really mean everyone around me, is with someone, happy, in love.

So, i dont know what to do. Ive hit my lowest low so far. Ive gone back to cutting myself, just so i can get some relief. Suicidal thoughts are on my mind constantly, but i know that even if i had the balls to do it, which i dont, it would probably drive my father to suicide aswell, and it would hit that girl hard. And she has a lot on her plate too, i cant do that to her....

So i dont even have a way out. It really feels like there is just nothing i can do. Tried applying to other workplaces, they wont take me, or they pay just enought to pay rent, and a weeks worth of food. Ive been actively trying to find someone to be with, only to be met with ignores, ghosting, catfishing or just plain rejections, mostly because of my face. I try to decompress, but apart from cutting, i just cant get my mind off of the problems that i have right now.

1ma3b32,What do I do? Depressed about career and relationships,"I am a 26 year old man currently on antidepressants. I have a degree in history, but work in a warehouse. I’ve never had a girlfriend or so much as a first kiss. I’ve gained weight due to using food as a coping mechanism. I am currently 265 pounds.

I’m at the end of my rope. Every time I’m alone with my thoughts, when I’m not actively distracted by family, friends, video games, or alcohol, I get very sad thinking about how my life is a waste. 

I’ve given myself a timer. If I don’t get any sort of relationship experience by the age of 30, I’m no longer going to be alive. 

I have started actually working on myself, as of the past week. I have been counting calories and not consuming as much food. Since alcohol has calories, I have to drink less in order to stay under my calorie budget.

I’m trying to get more exercise through walking a trail at a local park (I used to do this more in the spring but in the summer the heat has been near unbearable). I also have a video game that helps me exercise. I suffer from too much social anxiety currently to go to the gym. 

I’m trying to lose weight both for my health and so I can look more attractive. As much as I can, at least. My face is unattractive, with my large nose and small chin. It also doesn’t help that I’m 5’9. I’m just trying to be less fat so I can take a decent picture for dating sites again. 

I hate the fact I went to college. I have a degree that’s never been useful. The only thing college ever did for me was give me friends that have mostly remained after the five years since I graduated. 

I have to actively avoid “triggers” to prevent feeling depressed, such as almost any media with romance as a focus or plot point. I used to watch vtubers and streamers years ago but felt parasocial relationships forming and jealousy wishing any girl like them would interact with me. Maybe I can get back to enjoying what I used to one day, but I can’t in my current condition.

I’m a wreck. I don’t know what to do. Therapy isn’t really an option because no therapist in my area that is covered by my insurance has good reviews.",1753561356.0,2025-07-26 20:22:36+00:00,1,0,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma3b32/what_do_i_do_depressed_about_career_and/
1ma380s,"I don’t want to be here, but I also don’t want to give up.","Hi. This is my very first post on Reddit, and honestly, I’m not even sure how this works. I just know I needed to let this out somewhere. English isn’t my first language, so I hope this all makes sense.

I’m a 27year old woman, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve lived with depression and anxiety. More recently, I was diagnosed with ADHD.

Throughout the years, I’ve tried to get help. I went to seven different psychologists. Most of them never really connected with me… until three years ago, when I finally found someone who truly listened. During our very first session, I opened up about everything I was feeling, how worried I was about my own life, and how heavy it all felt. She immediately sent me to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with severe depression and prescribed medication.

The meds worked too well. I suddenly felt happiness for the first time in over 24 years and it overwhelmed me (stupid, i know). It was such a strange, intense feeling that I ended up stopping the meds and leaving the psychiatrist. About a year later, I went back and tried again, but the new medication didn’t feel right, and I didn’t feel safe or heard by that psychiatrist. So I left again.

Still, I continued with therapy every month. And things started getting better, really better. I felt more stable. I got a promotion at work. I reconnected with old friends. I was enjoying life, and I truly believed I had made it through the worst of it.

But two weeks ago… it was like everything came crashing back. I felt like I was drowning again. And the hardest part was not being able to explain why. Nothing was wrong. Life was going well. But the weight came back, and for the first time in a long time, I didn’t try to fight it. I just thought, “Please, let me go. I don’t want to be here anymore.” And I hated how familiar that thought felt. Like a dark comfort I hadn’t missed… but somehow had?

Then came the guilt. Because I’ve worked so, so hard to heal. I have great friends. I have family who supports me. But I don’t want to be a burden to them. I don’t want to tell anyone that I feel like I’m falling apart again. I feel ashamed. Like I’m failing after everything I’ve done to move forward.

I’m writing this because I just needed to get it off my chest. I have an appointment today with a new psychiatrist. I’m really nervous. I don’t know if it will go well. But even though a part of me feels like I don’t want to be here anymore… there’s still another part that refuses to stop fighting.

When I was a kid I think about 7, I forgot what I did but it clearly pissed him off because he pored a quarter of a bottle of hot sauce in my mouth and not like handed to me and make it drink it I mean, like squeeze my jaw so hard that I thought it was gonna break my jaw and stuff multiple spoons of it down my throat till I wanted to puke. I was then dragged out side to do yard work like pulling weeds and such which is normal punishment but my mouth burned so bad that I let my dogs lick the inside of my mouth just to try and make it stop, apparently I wasn’t doing the work fast enough tho so he came out started yelling at me again I don’t remember what he said I was to scared to hear anything but I do remember what his face looked like. He must’ve asked me a question and when I didn’t respond he grabbed me by my hair dragged me across the gravel yard up our concrete steps into our shed where he held me up with one hand by my hair and the other he held my neck to the point where I couldn’t breathe. He was yelling at me so much so close that he was spitting on my face while he yelled. He eventually left, but shut me in the shed. I don’t know if you locked me in there but I didn’t even try to open the door for a good two hours or more in the time. I was trying to choke myself I thought about telling my mom and getting him in trouble at all of this, but she was gone all this happened. All my older siblings were there, but not one of them tried to stop him. I don’t blame them, but I kind of feel like horrid Henry.

1ma2qsf,I don't know what to do anymore...,"I've been unemployed since January, I've been living with my parents, I've got no money and I'm constantly being reminded of this by said parents. 

Each day I wake up, it's the same old cycle every damn day. I smoke weed to numb the feelings but end up getting caught in a whirlpool of how everything's my fault, how I'm a disgrace to my family, and how I've got nobody to go to. 

There are good days, but there are mostly terrible shitty days. The Good days are great! It's like a high on it's own. But then the next day it's back to the same old shit. Getting yelled at and talked down on, getting blamed for others problems, being accused of anything under the sun. 


I've tried therapy, can't open up. Family wants me to fuck off so can't go to them either. In Canada we have MAID, Which I know it's qualify for, but I don't know.. each time I consider leaving this planet, I always think about how much better it would be for everyone around me. How much relief I'd get knowing I wouldn't have to go through this cycle anymore. Knowing I'd get to see my dead loved ones again. Knowing nothing that happens from there on wouldn't be my fault. 
Then there's the thought of my kid sister who's about to turn 4, I'd love to leave her something to have when she's 18 but I don't even have a job! At 20 years old. There's the thought of visiting her one last time, but I feel like that would give me false hope in what my life could've been.

1ma2pvd,I just want to live and sleep and live a normal life even if I am depressed.,"Why cant I just live alone without becoming insomnia.


Without all these terrible problems and pains.



Life would be better if there was less fear, less fear mongering and less evil overall.

I'm stuck in stagnation. I just want to sleep, to enjoy life as I did in childhood with innocence.

Now it feels if life cannot support adults, that it cannot support people who grow beyond Peter pan.

I just wish for sleep, for new change and survival. To live life with freedom and to be truly free. So much I want to say that I cant here. All I know is for a very long time I wanted to survive without all the nonsense and sleeplessness and nightmares.


I'm 25. I have nothing, I have no one. I'm the same as you. My social life online was better when I was 14/under as soon as I turned 15, and got food poisoning aka campybolacta I lost everything. I lost everything.

I cant work, I have insomnia, unwell, I cant even do anything except game. And maybe try to find entertainment.

I'm not ai, and I'm not a machine, I don't want to be a machine, I don't want to be an ai.

I want to finally find that inner peace and inner and outer goodness.

I wish animals could talk, I wish animals could help us, that I could make friends with animals so I wouldn't have to be alone. ",1753559862.0,2025-07-26 19:57:42+00:00,1,1,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma2pvd/i_just_want_to_live_and_sleep_and_live_a_normal/

And I never get to experience that type of stuff, I'm just meant to be like this?, I mean my father all he gives a fuck about in me is completing school and getting a miserable job and doing the same shit everyday and staying home and dying, that's what my father wants, but I don't want that, I want to experience things, I want to travel, I want to go on dates with my girl in Italy and all that, I wanna go to Makkah someday and be forgiven for my sins, but it looks like I am never having that, sometimes at night, I just wish to end it and just be done, and you know what I mean by ending it.. going to the other side, I just wish I was never born, cuz I not meant for anything, not a single thing, everyday is just sad and miserable, nothing nothing changes

1ma1vbl,tired,"Ever since summer started, i have done nothing at all.

I've seen people my age go out at least and hang out with eachother and do fun things. But i don't have anyone to do those things with. Sure, i can do it alone, but being lonely is just ... i dont know, i don't want to say that i hate it.

All I've been doing is rot in bed all day, maybe get up and wash my face and then go back to bed. It sucks even more because the longer i stay inside the more i feel fatigued. Every little thing or movement i do feels like im lifting up tons of bricks and it's so tiresome. My heart starts to beat faster, and i feel dizzy. I can't even go outside without fainting. I fainted at a restaurant a couple of weeks ago, and it was already embarrassing and i hated it.

2 days ago, my mom was drunk and came into my room, and i just can't forget about the things she said.

""Am i being a bad parent by letting you stay like this?""

""I bet you just want to go to a therapist and say bad things about me. That's all you'll ever want to talk about.""

""So who's fault is it that you're laying like this?""

""Your nails have grown and you're weak.""

""Look at these scars, who's fault is it?""

""I feel so embarrassed to talk about you to other people.""

There was more she said, but in the end i was the one who ended up comforting her. 

Im just so tired. I don't know what's wrong with me, and getting diagnosed is probably a hassle anyway. I just don't want to do anything. 

I don't as for much
I don't ask for anything 
I just stay quiet

So why are they so upset?

Shouldn't they be happy that im not a burden?

""Oh, you don't ask for anything like other kids. She's so easy.""

to

""Why don't you ask for anything? we are worried.""

Pick a struggle. Are you happy or are you not? 

I didn't even plan to live on for this long. So i have no idea on what to do for the future. I've taken notice of how many people relate to that. Im turning 17, and I'm ashamed to turn 17. 

There's a rooftop near where i live. Reasonably high. I thought about jumping off because i searched for available rooftops that weren't locked ever since i was 13.

Or just a rope. A couple minutes of strangling and difficulty to breathe. I don't even care if it hurts or not anymore i just want myself gone.

What's the point in living like this? Im in pain all day, i can't even go out without feeling exhausted and my ears beginning to ring and it becoming hard to breathe. 

I don't have friends, even if i do, they are just there. They can't help me. Im sure my parents hate me deep inside. Im a disappointment to my relatives and family tree. I don't even do well in school and people avoid me. I can't even communicate with others because I'm bad at talking and socializing in general.",1753557700.0,2025-07-26 19:21:40+00:00,3,0,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ma1vbl/tired/

my lawyer wants me to go to emerge and get a psych evaluation done but i honestly feel this is going to do my mental health more harm than good. I don't have the patience for hospitals.

Sounds great in theory except that the act wasn't even 1 day old when it was already being used to target wrongthink or to hide things that don't fall in line with the current government.

There was a supposedly a peaceful protest in London about a high-end hotel having all their rooms taken up for free by 'refugees'. To the point where hotel workers started protesting about the rooms being given away for free meaning they wouldn't get paid.

I feel motivated to go to work at my daycare, I have an easier time interacting with the kids now. It really has changed my life up compared to the start of this year and I'm so grateful.

Although I am feeling much better these days, I feel like I'm missing the creativity I used to have. I have the motivation for it now, but it's like the moment I want to do something that requires my imagination, my head goes blank and I just feel turned off from even trying. I'm (or used to be i guess) a very artistic person. I like to think I got it from my dads side of the family as my grandma was a spectacular artist and my dad always greatly encouraged my efforts in making art while growing up. I've been super into various forms of art, digital, pencil, painting, clay, etc. I also have always had a love for writing.

At this point I just want something to happen, i want to something to do so that I can continue living my life I hate just sitting idle like this, i have to move on with life and just like do something but I don't know what. this is just very difficult and I feel like it's not my fault uk like ya I made a mistake but I don't think I deserved all of this, all of what's happening, i don't want to think about all of this anymore but till I'm jobless like this I'll keep thinking about it, i want to move on in life.

1m9yscw,I'm not doing well,"Ive had a really hard life. Too hard. I used to thinking about killing myself all the time. As I grew older, I learned how to love myself. Then I met a monster. He made me hate myself again. 

I don't think I actually want to die, but I'm sick of meeting the monsters. I just want to be loved by someone, why is that so hard for me? Why am I so fucking unloveable to the point I was begging a drug addict to choose me over drugs, which never was going to happen. 

I tried so hard for this man while he dragged me through hell. I spent all of my time making him a better person while he stripped me one by one of everything I loved about myself. He made me feel the ugliest I've ever felt in my entire life. Why is loving the wrong person so detrimental to your health? 

He blamed everything on me, but this time I really see the blantant abuse he puts me through, just so he can do drugs. I have to be done this time, but I'm scared I will be lonely and miss him. Its so hard for me to remember all the pain he causes me and I always go back. 

He's killing me slowly and surely though. I almost killed myself last night and I continue to stair at my ceiling fan go round and round and all I want to do is hang from it. I know this isn't an everyday feeling. I know it's just from the abuse he has done to me. It is so hard though when he's made me hate myself this much.

I need help and I don't know where to turn at this point. I really don't think I want to die, I just want to right now. I don't have any friends or family to help me work through this and get to the other side. All I want is to forget everything about this evil person I gave my entire heart to. 

Can anyone help or chat? I really want to stop staring at my fan and get out of this mindset. I'm a beautiful person inside and out and don't want someone who had projected all of his ugliness on me. He hates himself, so he made me hate myself. How do I stop hating myself?",1753550090.0,2025-07-26 17:14:50+00:00,5,1,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9yscw/im_not_doing_well/

1m9yfso,everything feels empty,"I am 18M. I was sexually assaulted by another male 6 years older than me when I was 14 and it continued for three years I developed bulimia nervosa due to it did sh cuz most of the time I felt numb I didn't cry I wanted a release so I took refuge in pain. But accept this I didn't have a very good childhood either. My father was always posted outside of my country for work so since I was 6 I have been living alone with mom so I was made to feel like an adult from that very age bottled up every emotion and only focused on studies so that my mom doesn't feel overwhelmed and my dad doesn't get stressed out. I excelled in studies but I still didn't feel good abt anything my cousins envied me cuz my uncles and aunts always used to compare them to me so I never had a cousin to bond with I am also an only child so no siblings most of the ""friends"" in school only wanted things from me mostly related to studying stuff so I thought maybe this is friendship so I lived with fake friends till the age of 15 but then I realized that this friendship is fake. One of my friends whom I used to think was close when I told him abt everything he never really cared and always triggered my anxiety and panic attacks a lot even tho he knew my triggers and I still was there for him and when for the first time I said something back to him he said he never cared abt our friendship and he wishes that I should just kill myself cuz I don't deserve to live. I never told anyone abt my rape until I turned 16 and my parents still don't know only my 2 bsf, few other close friends and I still feel low and empty. I was also kind of the sacrificial child cuz my wants were never put first by anyone in my family or with my grandparents. Everyone just expected me to act like an adult to be the best to score the highest to be disciplined to follow every manner every rules whereas other of my cousins never did but I still saw that they were loved more. My mum was in her menopause phase when my rape started so I felt it will be too much for her to handle since she was already feeling a lot herself I even helped her a lot whenever she wanted me to be there but my father was still outside working in other country I still supported both of them by being the child they want but whenever I tried putting one want of mine forward I was called selfish and greedy once my mum even said that she'll kill me when I was a child because of a very small mistake that I didn't even do. I have gotten a lot better I think but I still feel empty numb and a burden sometimes. I even think sometimes that my friends are here cuz they pity me not because they want to be my friends I have even asked them this a lot of times they have always denied but my overthinking mind always gets in the way sometimes I think I am not worthy of anything maybe I wanted it maybe it was my fault maybe I am a slut. I have cried almost every night before going to bed I then did get better things started to feel light but suddenly in these past 1-2 months I have pushed everyone away stopped talking to everyone isolated myself deleted insta yt everything and I am not talking to anyone and just stay in bed I will be 5 months clean from sh on 1st august but the urges which have stopped have come back cuz I feel numb again and since the start I have take refuge in pain cuz I don't know how to be truly happy. I don't even remember a lot of my childhood everything is blank I have started to become very forgetful too and I don't even remember the first day it happened to me. Only few things I remember is of the present and 2-3 years back stuff mostly my mind is just blank and ik these are also fading. I don't expect anyone to read this but I just wanted to vent out cuz I want to cry but the tears also don't fall and there's just a constant ache and kind of a weight on my chest. I don't know what to do

1m9xurw,Suicide Awareness was a mistake,"Back in the day people either didn't try to save us or  released their anger by calling us selfish and damned to hell. I'm starting to believe that was a kindness on both sides. Families didn't feel responsible for their loved one's death and could turn their guilt into anger and move on. People who were just not compatible to life didn't have to live in agony because of it. Now we have to hubris to believe that everyone can be saved from their fate. We're running an overburdened mental healthcare system to the ground with this. There simply aren't enough volunteers, professionals, and general public educated on how to handle suicidal individuals and mental health crises. Plastering these hotlines and care centers everywhere is just giving  people false hope. Encouraging people who truly don't have the mental capacity or know-how to ""reach out to a friend"" is just creating a cycle of compassion fatigue. They go into it believing it's a simple endeavor and then take it out on their mentally ill friends once they've burned out further traumatizing their mentally ill friends.

I'm struggling to cope with the people around me, or rather the people living with me. I don't want to go outside because I'm scared people will judge me for looking like a girl, yet having the body of a post-puberty boy. I also can't commute to my past home place and back to my friends, even though that's the only thing I wished for. I know I'm not a perfect human, but I just want to feel loved, or rather, feel needed and appreciated, but I know people won't do that because they hate me, or not. I just want to play volleyball with someone/my friends, and I wanna go home back to my hometown and to my Aunts. Yet I'm scared of judgement, and I also fear that they have already forgotten me, besides, none of my brothers and sisters acknowledge me, they all label me as ""Mama's boy"" even though my mother focuses on them the same, if not much more than me. My point is, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Even though no one's saying they hate me, and no one's acting like they forgot me. I just wanna know how to stop the pain, to make the voices disappear. I just want to feel appreciated and loved, but I, myself, prevent other people from doing so, because I'm scared that if I feel too attached to them, when the time comes for them to leave, I won't accept my fate and destiny.

I'm once again feeling depressed. But I think something has changed in my emotions, because, instead of the usual crying in the bathroom and my room, I have found myself in a state of happiness and joy. I think it's because of the phone I'm holding, because now, since I have load, I have been sticking to it the whole day, and I have felt my mouth smiling. But once I let go of the phone, I am once yet again, brought back to reality that I'm, still the black sheep of the family. I'm weak, skinny, and not loved dearly by neither my brothers nor sisters, because they have their own ""Special Someone"" to take care of. I may be tall and an academic genius, but none of that matters the emotions stirring in me. I have always thought of myself as strong and smart, but deep in my heart, I know that's all a lie. I'm not strong, nor mentally stable too. And I'm not THAT smart. I'm just above average, there's always someone or something better than me at something. And last night, seemingly out of nowhere, my aunt, Je-han from my hometown messaged, and I thought I could just ignore it, but my finger moved on instinct and replied faster than my mood can change. When my mother and I was on the way to Manila, we rode on buses, boats, ferries, and vans. And the first day of our leave, my aunt Je-han was always texting me and asking for my health and stuffs. But after I'm back to my apartment, I was heartbroken to see that no one, even my siblings messaged me if I was okay or if how I felt being back to Manila. And let me tell you, they knew we were back to Manila because mom told them once we were on the bus. But no, none of them even messaged me, they only messaged my mom. And that was the moment I became depressed, that moment of loneliness got stacked to every problem and mental deterioration I was already facing. So I was obviously bitter and shocked when she messaged me if I had eaten already and if how I felt being back to Manila, but I don't know why my fingers moved on instinct and replied back like a child missing it's mother. I felt hopeless, knowing that I could always easily be overwhelmed, tricked, and think that I'm safe. My point is, ever since she messaged me last night, my heart broke into pieces I can't even count anymore, because I knew, that I could easily be tricked into thinking someone/they love me again, through some simple messages that's not even deeply endearing or deep enough to touch a regular person's heart.

Jealousy - Volleyball, Volleyball, Volleyball... The sport that I have looked up to ever since I saw Haikyuu!! And Tobias Krick... The sport that I've wanted to play for so long now... The sport that made me feel... whole and complete... But I'm scared to ask, I'm scared to ask to play, because I'm scared of fear and judgement from other people... I'm scared that they'd treat me differently from other...

New home - Besides, I don't even have friends in my new apartment... I'm... I'm just... I'm just here. I'm just living in this apartment like a dog. I've been allowed to go outside but I scared of judgement from people I don't even know about. I'm scared of the judgement from a new home place. And I can't even come back to my old hometown, even though it's just one jeepneey ride away. Because, apparently, my mother is scared I'd ""Damage my beautiful skin""... I'm not even white, I'm brown because of all the work I've been doing back at my home province. But no, apparently she's scared I'll wander off and become a homeless man. But I know the reason, she's just scared  that I get to go and pursue my dream of playing volleyball and leaving her, but the truth is, I'm done being caged from this home, I'm done being caged like a bird like I always was. I was always caged in my home ever since I was 4, but I don't like it anymore, I want to be like a normal kid. To be able to play. To be able to have fun outside. But no. My mom says that ""Caging me inside"" and ""having my long hair"" are the only distinct and prominent differences between me and the children of the world. I've also started to feel Joy from time to time. And I know that it's a good thing, but I'm scared that I'll get tricked by my own emotions again, and be left hanging on a thread. And I'm also scared that whoever reads this novel would be disappointed by my sudden change of mood. I'm scared that if I fully embrace this Joy that I have been receiving, I'd fully let go of the pain that has been etched to my heart, to let go of the pain that has shaped me into the author you now know, and I'm scared I may not be able to finish this novel on my own...

""Please forgive me dearly if my novel's third part was bland and boring. But it's because of the work I've been doing. I've also been feeling Joy and happiness through the people around me, so I'm focusing more on myself for now... But I wish to finish this novel and show you the pain that has been etched to my heart and soul. And please forgive me, but I want to try to embrace my Joy, but still not fully letting go of my pain. And as always, To God Be The Glory.  P.S -JanJan""

Sorry for the disruption. But I am gonna have a small break from writing from now on.😓 I want to try and improve my philosophy and linguistics literature, while also trying to figure out the true depth of my pain, to try and give you a new look at my novel.😅

- ""Cogito Ergo Sum Doleo"" Fourth Chapter 
Time when making this 12:23 AM -  1:35 AM 6/2/25
Going back - My mind has been going back to my hometown and Aunts, one again. And I've been making funny  imaginations in my brain, while trying to distract myself from the harsh reality. The reality that they have forgotten about me. They have forgotten about me and have moved on in their life like normal. And I know that it's normal for people to move on to try and cope with the harsh reminder that someone has left them, but I can seem to understand why I keep getting hurt at the thought of them moving on and forgetting about me, I can't seem to hold a grasp of reality, because my mind has been going through many problems, emotions stirring and mixing like a soup of pain, joy, and pain once more. 

My home place - Everything has started to feel fake and imaginative, ever since I've felt true joy, ever since I came home to my family. I've started to feel less excited, and I've started to feel as if I'm only watching through a screen and moving my body telepathically. I've always been easily excited and overwhelmed at the same time when I was a kid, but some moments of my life have started to feel bland and fake, I've never been truly excited since the day I've stepped foot in my household that I've so desperately been wanting for the past 6 years. I thought that when I came back, just maybe, someone would appreciate and call out to me, meeting me and praising me for my growth. But no. Rather... I felt disappointed, and ignored by the people around me. I felt as if, they had felt annoyed that I was back, and that I had brought with me, Pride, and also Annoyance... I felt hopeless. I thought that maybe my siblings or my other family members would appreciate me coming back... But no. It was as if an animal had come back to disrupt peace against the town. I felt ignored and hated by none other than my family themselves.

Mental health -  I've said this in my previous chapter. But I have started feeling lonely, ignored, and hated once more. Even though I had started to feel Joy and Happiness. I had once again been brought back to my usual self, or rather... Relapsed back to a much more fragile self. 

""I'll come back and try to finish the mental health part of my fourth chapter, but I think I'll just try and put it on the next fifth one. And I'm so sorry if the writing is bad😓 I'm so sleepy right now, but I wanted to make the fourth part because I was guilty of not making it earlier😓 and as always. To God Be The Glory. P.S -JanJan""

It makes me feel like it’s something that I should’ve done because usually it’s the opposite for people. They attempt, it doesn’t work or someone stops them, then their life gets better. No one exactly stopped me I was just to afraid too follow through and it never happened and my life hasn’t gotten better. It’s worse now and I keep thinking it’s my punishment for not going through with it. Like as in I was never supposed to have lived this long anyways and that I was always supposed to have committed.

1m9x17t,Not good enough,"


Hi i am 30 years old male, I was beaten really badly by my mother at a young age and then by teachers. I was so little that when mother would beat me 1 used to make this funny sound out of pain. That same sound I used to make when teacher started beating me in the school and whole class would laugh. There was a point they would just beat me to have fun and make the class laugh. This was in kindergarten. Then at the age of 10 I lost my mother to gas cylinder explosion. Honestly I did not feel much sad at the time because I think I did not know what exactly had happened. was kind of numb and all the relatives and other family members were showing extra love to me so 1 I did not feel much at the time. Also as a part of tradition i had to see my mother s face for last farewell and jt was all burnt. I still remember that face. father was in indian army he did not beat me ever but he was SO SO strict and his voice was to loud and strong like giving commands to another army man. After my mother gone I started studying in boarding school and in the holidays I would live with different aunts and uncles. Initially few month was okay everyone was extra loving to this motherless child. But after some time I was made feel that I don't belong there. After all the beatings and traumas I was filled with rage but I could not do anything I would just smile. No matter if my cousin broke a thinh and did anything wrong . It was always blamed on me but I would just smile ( mind you I still have that extra wide weird smile but my eyes don't smile). I was just given chapati and deal while cousins would have all the nutrious stuff. I was always low on iron b12 and other things whole my life and I always felt tired. Since I was filled with rage I would just eat what was given like crazy I was obese always even in my teenage. This somehow fucked with my puberty as well and penis size which is still 4.5 inches. 1I got decent beard at 30. But now I am virgin ,I am bit of intelligent as well. I am sacred to make a physical relation. I am scared to confront people and take a stand for myself. am 6ft 2 and everyone things I am strong and perfect. But from inside 1 am weak little kid. Sometimes I think 1 am just deliberately faking it.I smoked weed and cigs for 10 years. Weed is bit under control now and cigs has gone high. I don't want to plan or do anything 1 just want to lay down and think that's what I have been doing all my life. I don't feel the urgency of the things. My therapist said its because of the emotional burn out. Being at 30 no skills, no money and huge debt, bad brain chemistry sometimes 1 feel like ending it all. But deep down I know 1 gave some potential but it feels already too late. Sorry for the long post I don't think most would relate. But what about the people who's been living in chronic stress and ptsd, never felt seen and always criticised abused ? Willthese people ever be able to live normal lives ? Will they be happy? Will they ever sleep peacefully? Please suggest something for me ALA A",1753545835.0,2025-07-26 16:03:55+00:00,3,0,depression,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9x17t/not_good_enough/
1m9wx89,"This level of exhaustion is a new, all time high.","It's been building. I've been trying to keep it down and 'fake it' away but I reached a breaking point this week. 

I screamed at my family that I wanted to die. I screamed at my family, my husband and my kids, that no one really gives a fuck about me. I screamed at them that no one cares.

I apologized later that evening for my actions and they know I need help. 

The overwhelming feeling of not being anyone's first thought or a priority fucking hurts. If that's true or not, I don't fucking know. But my brain makes me feel this way. The meds don't change that, they just keep that shit quiet.

What pushed me over the edge? My non-listening ass son and my non-helpful ass husband. What else? Being at a party with 8+ other 'friends' but not being included in conversation. That stings. 

The weight of this world and all the shit going on INSIDE and OUTSIDE of the US has me so exhausted I want to fall asleep and not wake up.

1m9wt62,I’m so fucking miserable,"I genuinely don’t know what to do. I feel so much self hatred it’s insane. I am so fucking ugly and weird and I don’t have any good friends and I’m just so lonely and alone and nobody understands. 2 days ago I self harmed in multiple ways because I couldn’t take it anymore and I had a big mental breakdown. I cried for hours and hours and nobody noticed as always. Yesterday I felt so strange and disassociated and had no strength to do anything nor did I have any appetite. I just stayed in bed the whole day and felt weird. Everything also just kept going wrong on this day. There’s one friend I have who always vents to me but she’s never there for me in the same way but I was feeling so desperate I ended up reaching out to her. Like always, she ended up turning the whole thing back to herself and she started venting about her own problems rather than paying attention to what I have to say. I haven’t talked to her properly since.We’ve also been drifting apart a bit and she has a new friend and I think I’m already replaced/she prefers that friend over me. I just feel so abandoned and alone and nobody understands at all. Today It got so bad that I did something which I never do which was breaking down in front of my mom. But all I got was a scolding and she kept telling me that there’s nothing wrong with me so stop trying to act like there is. I just felt so fucking terrible and I just didn’t know what to do. I cried a bit more but then just stopped. I’m writing this right now and we’re supposed to be going out but I have no energy. Everyone is so fucking annoying asking me why I am so quiet despite seeing me cry in front of them (and invalidating me). I want to feel anger and resentment but all I feel right now is sadness. I feel so sad and depressed and also numb at the same time and I can’t bring myself to even speak because I’ll end up crying and I’m just so so not okay and I wish I had someone I wish I could talk to a therapist I am seriously so out of it my arm stings so bad and I’m just so over all of this ",1753545304.0,2025-07-26 15:55:04+00:00,19,2,depression,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9wt62/im_so_fucking_miserable/
1m9wnv7,Struggling with alcoholism and losing hope,"My boyfriend and I had a conversation. I asked him if it was okay if I could drink with some friends and he said that it wasn't a good idea, since he wasn't gonna be there to make sure I was okay. He told me, ""You're doing so good."" I told him why I wanted to do it. Then it dawned on me that this speech I was making, while truthful, was also the way I used to convince myself that I wasn't an alcoholic and drank without worry. 

There's this switch-like feeling that goes off in my head. Very light, very subtle. It's almost like the indicator that my addiction is about to speak for me. Trying to handle my daily life as it stands now is difficult. I imagined how better it would be for me if I got clean and sober. I imagined getting a job, my own place, my own car and everything else would fall into place. It's now the end of July and I still don't have a job. I'm dirt poor, which is making it hard to hang out with my friends who can do so much more with their money and free time. 

I thought things were going to be so different but it turns out that I drank and did my drug of choice *because* I couldn't handle the position I'm in. Reality is, we can't choose to have a career, we choose to apply for them. The people running those businesses choose to give us a career. What do you do when you're my age and you've barely gotten any experience? For tge past 16 years my job was to keep myself alive and fight my demons. I tried to start up a small business but in the end, it failed miserably. What do can I do? 

The hardest part is that I can't find a single person to tell this all to. I can relate to alcoholics and drug addicts but they're still alcoholics and addicts, I can't befriend them. Recovered alcoholics and addicts want to put this behind them, they rarely talk about it. I can't tell my friends, they don't know what it's like. I don't want to burden my boyfriend with this. My parents will never care enough to understand what I'm dealing with, it'll just be a fight. My older sister will tell my mom ehat I've said. My younger sister is too busy for me. I've tried to talk to my therapist but she specializes in DBT, which is what we mainly talk about. 

Reality is, I've got everybody but nobody and it's eating me alive. I feel like I'm one mental spiral away from binge drinking. If I drink the way I used to again, I could lose everything I already worked so hard to build up. Yet I'm in a constant state of not knowing what to do any anymore. I don't know how to proceed in life. I don't know what to do from here.

1m9vq5q,Numbness: Not feeling depressed but still planning suicide,"25M, I don’t feel anything anymore, but I’m still planning my suicide.

When I was 19 and my depression was just starting out, I used to feel everything. I’d break down crying, feel overwhelmed, crushed by the weight of my own thoughts. I remember it being loud and painful.

And now I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel heavy. I don’t feel much of anything at all. Just numb. When I caught myself feeling this way, I assumed this must be what ""normal"" or ""neutral"" feels like.

But the thoughts never left. I still think about suicide like calmly. And I'm still planning and seeking ways to eventually end it.

1m9vive,No hope for humanity,"I was born into a family with a ton of issues, an abusive father who can't keep a job and a neglectful mother who would rather be high on weed and drunk then talk to her son who has there own children already, my father had a daughter from another woman and my mother had a son from another men, but had them really young and it ruined their lives I've been told all my life that.
 I was a sickly baby, was born premature and had asthma till I was 13 and had horrible tantrums like you've never seen from any child before, my siblings had it rough as well, my brother has passed from a fentanyl laced heroin overdose, my sister is batshit crazy and blames everything till this day on her family even though she hasn't seen them in many years, and I currently live with my mom who tries nowadays and knows she could of done stuff differently.
 As a adult I regret the tantrums, I sit and think often about regrets and wish I could go back and not do them, like minor things but also things I think were me lashing out on people or family and in some cases I feel like I was possessed or truly evil myself, but suddenly when I was around 15 I developed a conscious or I at least realized that the chaos that I was use to from my drunk abusive father beating me and my mother telling me to shut up she doesn't care she's busy, that I shouldn't act that way to other people and I don't like being treated that way.
  It turned me into a people pleaser, to repent for the way I acted while I was younger I try to be better every day, but I've inherited my father's alcoholism and my mother's pot smoking to disassociate, everywhere I go I try my best and eventually the people I meet and try to be friends with use me and spit me out like I'm garbage, and I can't help it the only people I identify with are losers because I come from a family of losers but yet I'm always put down and kicked and kicked deeper, at 17 I thought I found a family, turns out my friends were only around me because I had money from a part time job, then 19 I thought I made more friends at another job I worked at, turns out they were talking shit about me behind my back, now at 23 I was finally feeling stable I just left my job after being physically assaulted by a coworker multiple times but because after I fought back he looked worse off then I did, didn't matter that I was the victim originally it's because they like the other dude more I was told to leave.
 I know why they liked the other dude more, it's because I'm ugly, quiet, fat, and scary looking from facial scars and height I am someone you wouldn't want to walk by late at night down a alley way but that's not something I wished for, that's genetics that I started balding at 17, and that I look like lurch from the Adams family but fat, the other dude is like a 6'5 pretty boy that's got a baby on the way, and he acts like a school yard bully, meaning he does stuff like wipe a dirty glove on you're face and then talks to the oblivious manager about how his girlfriend is getting pregnancy sickness, I finally got annoyed by him actually assaulting me so after he did that to my last night at work I fought him till I had him in a chokehold till he submitted in the middle of a fast food kitchen with 4 other people there, and on my way out I slashed his tires, but that's only because I got told to never come back and it's the same way every where I go, I'm always used to do the grunt work and then if I ever stand up for my self I get put back down in my place.
 I'm now 300 pounds overweight and I don't know if I want to live, everything has always turned to shit when I touch it, and even when I try to be better every one always stabs me in the back, I know I shouldn't trust people at this point but for some reason they always trick me into trusting them just so they can royally screw me over later.
 I know my mom would be sad if I die, and I saw how heart broken she was when my older brother died but I honestly don't know if I can live in this world anymore, all I do now is disassociate while watching TV shows and drink and smoke... I can't trust anyone, no one loves me but my mom emotionally attached mother...

1m9sqmu,Life is a struggle,Context I'm 29 male I have an 11 month old daughter and I want her to value her life and others. My parents were suicidal my entire childhood and my dad a racist neonatzi type. I was raised to hate everyone including myself and my parents put absolutely no value in me my siblings their own or anyones lives. I've struggled to find purpose anytime things get tough I'm taken back to the backseat of my mom's car having to talk her out of killing herself and I because shes trying to end it with all us kids in the car. I know I value life but I'm so terrified of repeating a pattern because I don't value my own. I think about killing myself far to often I think of it as a release my parents constantly glorified death as a reset and refered to life as hell. I don't want my daughter growing up thinking death is better than the struggle. I want her to be able to handle the ups and downs I want to end the second hand hate and generational trauma I worry that I'm not strong enough.,1753534779.0,2025-07-26 12:59:39+00:00,2,2,depression,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9sqmu/life_is_a_struggle/

Honestly I see no point for myself to keep living. I wake up, go through same normal routines, go back to sleep, my emotions is either not there at all or it is all just to much. mostly negative now.  And it makes me wonder that, Why do living things, organisms, humans, wants to live? They spreads, they eat, they move to keep functioning, why? For what? Happiness? It is just part of the brain tricking you, electrical cues or stuff to certain parts of your brain and makes you happy too. make a world a better place? Pass down what? thoses things are not important or needed. right? Maybe that's wrong.  
I feel like I have a very deep depression since I have self harmed for a while and then stopped because people will see it during the summer with no sleeves, and bad attention means trouble. I don't want to be a burden more than I am.  
 I am so done and my brain just feels so dull now. I know there are way more people out there needs more help than I do, deserves this than I do.

I am messing up my studies, my relationships, my routines. I couldn't do that. I am not allowed to do that.

The only way I found with coping is either waiting for it to go away or note down things.

I am a useless, selfish coward. Who can't even do stuff properly and can't give myself I clean cut to be gone properly.",1753533455.0,2025-07-26 12:37:35+00:00,3,0,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9sadl/thoughtswhy_does_every_living_creature_want_to/

One of the things that bothered me was the unrealistic work expectations while I was suicidal and fighting to survive. 

Recently I survived cancer, but my sister bailed on me two days before surgery. My friends took care of me while I was recovering. 

Anyway I have dated some.  Pretty sure my gf just cheated on me this weekend. I just have this very deep feeling there are very few good people left. I isolate because I am just sick of being hurt. I don't have any family left.

From the outside I was always the rock/anchor. I look like I have it together.  I look like I am very strong.i have been there for a lot of people. 

I have the same feelings when I was 19. I just want to sell everything and go somewhere else. I have done this before and realize this doesn't solve my problems.

It feels like I am just sabotaging myself at this point. I haven't been eating, drinking, showering, or brushing my teeth. I drank a half a bottle of gin on an empty stomach yesterday and it hurt so fucking bad, but it gave me a few hours of peace focusing on not vomiting my guts out I guess. I have also been self harming pretty bad, have beaten my arms fully black and blue at this point. It relieves my anxiety and feels pretty good, I just tell myself I deserve the pain. People say I'm only 25 and I have all the time in the world to figure it out but I just feel lost. I also feel like shit because I'm quite privileged with good friends and family, but I really just can't care about anything. Went on a walk to check out if the nearest bridge was tall enough to die from but it isn't even close to being tall enough lol, I just worried my family they were out looking for me.

I was hoping to make a decent amount of savings so I didn’t need to move back in with my parents, start over, meet a girl and maybe stay down here for good. 

But now as I am approaching the end of my visa, and time is running out for me to reapply while in country, I don’t want to stay here in the country, but I don’t want to live at home either again. I have maybe $4,300 of savings, I hate the place I’m living in now, the job I’m doing. I could move around, but I keep applying for other jobs with no luck. 

I am really struggling with depression, and I feel like this is taking the joy out of my trip. If I stay here, then I will be struggling alone. If I go home, I will be struggling to find work and I’ll have to live with my parents again, with the regret of not seeing more of Australia, but at least I will have a support network and I can always come back to Australia some day.

I oversoaked chickpeas and so they are spoiled and they are to waste I have 0 money to pay for hospitalization if I were to eat them. A stray cat appears to me wanting food but I have none. My laptop is broken and I am worried I broke it while opening it there's a screw that rotates but it is not unscrewing there's a broken piece under. It's important that I try doing it myself because I have no money I am jobless. My charger is not working. I look at my photo and there's a rotten face inside out. I am genetic defected even if it's invisible I carry it and I am worried about it and it's related things. I failed my classes didn't even particpate or attend. Some people congratulate me despite the sinking doom feeling I have no hope but they talk they talk they think I succeeded I never said anything they assume they are like stepping on me without realizing they unintentionally adding to the shame and guilt and pressure I feel and they are unintentionally invalidating me by complimenting in false context when I am hit with reality. So I am hit with this. I went and made exams and all of what I written is BS I am ashamed. I know I am thinking in the wrong direction but now I give up I must have failed I just couldn't do it the last day I gave up. My mom talks to me and she is always angry and dismissive to me and somewhat tells me that I am parasite. My dad also avoids me because he can sense that I am a manchild and problematic so he dismisses me and goes away even if he seems inviting in his langauge his body language like twisting his pec and aversion tells me he wants to avoid me because I am problematic and sometimes he gets silent.

I didn’t slack off, I pushed myself, stayed focused, kept dreaming. I even have two years of solid experience in administration, and teaching experience on top of that.

But now?

I can’t even land a decent-paying job. Not one that lets me live comfortably, let alone save for marriage. Or enjoy life a little. Or even feel proud when someone asks me what I do.

It’s like... the world keeps telling us, “Work hard, get educated, build experience, and you’ll be fine.” But I did. I am all of that. And still, I’m stuck in this exhausting cycle of underpaid jobs, “we’ll let you know” emails, and empty hope.

I’m not asking for luxury. I’m asking to live. To have enough to build a future, to take someone’s hand and say, “We’ll be okay,” and actually mean it.

It’s not just about money. It’s about dignity. It’s about the silent shame I carry when I scroll through job sites at midnight, wondering what I did wrong. It’s about watching years of effort sit quietly in a folder named “CV,” while people with half the qualifications seem to move on without struggle.

I’m tired. I really am. I know I’m not the only one, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less. 

To anyone else out there silently battling the same feeling, you're not alone. And to those who made it to the other side, I hope you remember how this felt, and I hope you hold the door open.

Because right now, I don’t want millions.
I just want enough. And I know, I really do know, in this life there aren't easy way, or easy life, we just need to be patient, which is the hardest part in life.

Even though I’m pushing through with finishing my studies, which should make me feel something, because it’s my dream study and I only have 1 year left of my Masters, I feel nothing and I’m crying every day because I don’t like anything and don’t want to do anything. I can’t get real sleep and I don’t feel at ease at any time of the day or night. My struggle to get and keep friends have put me in a position where I have no friends, I only have a boyfriend who tries his best, and still, I don’t feel safe. I don’t even know if we should still be together, but I’m scared to be completely alone. My mind tells me that I’m broken and there’s nothing to be done, I’ve tried medication and therapy, but I just know that there’s something so wrong with me, and I have no clue how to fix it.

Does anybody else have experience in dealing with this kind of hopelessness?",1753522029.0,2025-07-26 09:27:09+00:00,3,1,depression,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9p2me/feel_like_ive_died_inside/

My whole childhood , my family, everything, i come from nothing. the worst possible things to ever happen have happened, yet the only only thing keeping me going is knowing i have so much potential, i know i can build a nice life, i know i can get away from it soon, i know i can break the cycle, i know i can get help. Just knowing is enough to keep me going, im thankfully doing so well academically and in uni studying paramedicine. I fear for how my life could have potentially planned out if i wasn’t so academically gifted. I would have nothing to to live for essentially, no goals no way out. And yes i know education isn’t the only way but it’s a WAY. 

of course it’s always in the back of my mind, some days the urge to do it is so intense but i know to work through them minutes and have the resilience to see the potential i have and the change that can come.

1m9n19g,I will never be happy,"22M

I think my brain is completely broken. It’s too much mental illness and it’s too much idiocy. I will never do anything right I can never do anything right me being alive is just hurting everyone around me every time I’m existing it just brings me and others pain and suffering all of the fucking time and I’m a complete failure in all aspects. 

The realization I’ve had is that nothing works anymore and honestly, I’ll never be happy. I just never will be because I feel like my brain is just incompatible with the world. Nothing will ever make me happy because I will have to always work and put effort into shit and I’m a lazy ungrateful loser. I’m genuinely and a lazy loser. I can’t do anything right I go to work come home and I have to escape every second for my mind or else. I’m sad even when I’m escaping. I’m sad. I’m always sad. Literally every second of the day. I’m fucking sad. I’ve never actually been happy genuinely because I’m such a fucking broken failure. That will never amount to anything.

I can’t even die cause you go to hell for that also even if there’s no hell it still hurts everyone around you and it’s fucked up and then I say all this shit but I’m the one who also gets anxious by every fucking little thing every second so who am I fucking say anything? All of my emotions are fake bullshit that are just fucking invading my mind and I don’t deserve to feel any of them. They’re all fucking fake shit cause I’m a fucking fake ass person. I’m a complete loser who doesn’t deserve anything . I don’t deserve happiness. I don’t deserve to ever have a wife. I don’t deserve love. I don’t deserve anything because I fucked up so much that nothing I do can ever repay anything and me being alive is my biggest sin probably

I try to get better but it just doesn’t fucking work. It doesn’t fucking work and even if I try to get better in other ways, it’s still hard as fuck and I keep failing and not doing what supposed to do regardless cause I’m such a stupid loser.

1m9lyyj,I just realised I was an overall bad person in high school,"Throwaway here. I've suddenly come to the realization that I was a bad person in high school. for years I blinded myself into believing I was a good person, but after a few years after high school, I look back and I realised how shitty of a person I was to others in High School.

thinking back, I thought I was an actual nice person to be around but I wasn't.

during lunchtime breaks, when I came to school, I would usually bring a basketball to play with, and other also came to the courts. everyone would rely on me as the ball guy. we would play 3 on 3 every lunch time. but every once in a while, I would want to practice on my own, so while everyone would be waiting to play at the regular court, I would go to a separate court with my ball. since they didn't have a ball they would come to me and try to convince me but I would refuse, and when I'd refuse they would steal the ball and run around with me chasing them and sometime I would get frustrated and kick them in the legs.

Something I really look back and I really hate myself and regret doing was In 9th grade. I bullied a kid for almost have a year because he was odd and gay.

One of my best friends has 2 autistic brothers. I was insensitive and told him one time when we were playing 1v1 basketball, when I won a game, I said, that's why you have 2 fucked up brothers and I don't. I apologised afterwards for the comment I made, but it still stuck with me. we are still friends though.

I'd bully my sister sometimes when others were around. when its just us, things would be fine, but when our cousins would come or friends, I'd name call her and talk bad about her in front of others. I don't do that anymore now, but I'm still going to include this.

I've called other that they were bad in both basketball and football.

During a trip sports trip overseas, I was a really difficult person to deal with, I was sleeping when supervisors people were talking, eating unhealthy foods when we were not supposed to, and I even made a supervisor yell at me for taking food into my hotel room which was not allowed. Afterwards, the main supervisor talked to my parents and told them that one of the other students wanted to punch me because of how I acted during the trip.

Its been a few years since high school and i've kind of distance myself from people. during the time alone, i've realised how much of a dick and bad person I was in high school and why I didn't really make connections during my time in high school. the realisation has made me put me in a mental pit (depression) that I couldn't get out of for a few years and I hate myself, but I want to move on and improve myself and change for the better.

Any constructive criticism, advice, or similar experiences would really help and be greatly appreciated. You can insult me if you want to, I just want to move on and improve myself in any way possible.",1753510005.0,2025-07-26 06:06:45+00:00,3,0,depression,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9lyyj/i_just_realised_i_was_an_overall_bad_person_in/

1m9kcx6,I want to be worse,"Every little thing makes me mad, irritated, upset.. I’ll convince myself insane things and when I come to my senses I’ll miss being scared. I don’t know why I just like the feeling.

I like feeling sore, tired, and paranoid. To the point I’ll actively try to make myself worse. I’ll bang things against my legs as I work so I get more and more sore. I like how the bruises look even though I always wear long pants. I hate it when other people worry about it though - that just makes me angry. I hate how pitiful people are of me. 
I found a white hair in my eyebrows one day and was so happy. I even tried taking a picture of it but it barely showed up. I like it when my body looks sickly. I like it when my eyebags get dark. 
I don’t like when my teeth are yellow though for some reason- I think it’s because bad dental hygiene = bothering other people with the smell when I talk?
I want to cut myself but I have to wear short sleeves at my job. To cope I’ll just trace my skin with things so I get to see it get red and bumpy but it doesn’t leave actual scars.
I especially love the way being beat up looks - not on other people of course. 
Ive been too tired and too wimpy to actually do anything, so I never have done something grand.
 
I love love the idea of laying in bed motionless all day. I already do that but I have work and school coming up so it’s not 24/7. I like being unresponsive.. like if someone is talking to me I’m just staring into space.

1m9jxyz,I’m going to kill myself when I get out of the military,"I joined at 27 years old and it gave me purpose again. My adult life up to that point was a waste. I felt like I had so much untapped potential and something to give to the world. I ended up enlisting and immediately felt that gratification that I thrived for. I had a second chance at life. Made decent money, made friends, felt like I belonged for the first time in my life.

A couple years in I deployed, the lead up was by far more stressful than the actual time spent away. Overall it was a good experience, I was not in a legit combat zone and didn’t see anything combat related or disturbing. However something I can’t quite put my finger on started happening. I started feeling like I was dying. I thought I was going to die on a weekly basis. It felt like a heart attack. I went to the base clinic and chased symptoms that seemed like they were cardiac. Chest pin, pressure, and existential dread. I was sure there was something wrong. 
This was my introduction to anxiety and mental health issues. This wasn’t the worry you hear people talk about.. “ oh I have anxiety I’m so worried. “ no. This was ANXIETY. This was complete physical anxiety. 

Since then, it’s doesn’t matter how many of these attacks I have, they never get better. They never get easier. I have them at work now. I have to try and leave and sit in my truck to ground myself. It’s so embarrassing. I’m an NCO now allegedly in charge of other Airmen but I can’t even face the day. It’s so disgraceful. 

Anyways all that started happening. I was going to get out in 2023 after 4 years because it didn’t seem like I could take anymore. I became short with everybody and even have intense outbursts to superiors. 
I got within about 7 months of leaving and I freaked out. What am I going to do? Where am I going to work? I’m doomed to the life I lived before. I panicked and ended up getting an opportunity to retrain and get a new job in the Air Force.

I put so much pressure on myself to do well in tech school learning my new job. I got picked up for an IT gig. Something I thought would set me up skill wise to have a future post military. I had no experience with computers but studied enough to get the best score on my security plus exam in the class. I was eager once again to learn and have a fresh start.

I PCSd to my home state, another good sign of things to come. However my family has never come to see me despite being 4 hours away. I take leave and try and go out of my way to accommodate everyone but the effort is completely one sided. On top of that the place I work now isn’t even the job I trained for. I’ve been here for 15 months and been stretched so thin. I try every day to find a way to be productive. To be a part of the team but I just don’t belong. I’ve never truly belonged anywhere no matter how hard I have tried but at this very moment I’ve never been so out of place. I’m 8 months away from leaving and am so desperate that I just took a volunteer job as a receptionist to get away from my office. I was under the assumption I would be able to extend for 12 months to try and accommodate for this transition but I read the fine print today and it looks like I’m either going to have to reenlist for 4 years or I’m going to get out in 8 months. Except now I don’t have 8 months to plan, I have a 6 month commitment that will cut me so short and leave me unprepared. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist and we have talked about my passive intrusive thoughts I have had. I’m really to my breaking point. I won’t let myself struggle anymore. If it gets bad enough I want to go missing. I want to go somewhere where I will never be found. I want to end it in complete solitude in a place I will never be discovered to rot in nature and just cease to exist. 

I can’t take anymore failure and I can’t take very much longer of being me. I’m so sick of myself and I’m so disgusted with everyone in my life on a daily basis. 

When I get out of the military, I can’t imagine a world where I don’t end up a statistic.",1753503051.0,2025-07-26 04:10:51+00:00,24,7,depression,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9jxyz/im_going_to_kill_myself_when_i_get_out_of_the/
1m9jum9,I wish something would kill me so nobody would have to know I want to commit suicide,"I literally have no future ahead of me. I'm 16 and I've entirely failed the first two years of high school because I've been in and out of inpatient. My gpa is probably below a one. I can't afford college and there's no job i want to work. I want to die so badly but i know how bad it would hurt my mom and brother, i can't do that to them. I really wish something else would happen that would kill me just so i could be gone, and nobody could blame it on me

I don't leave my house, I have friends but I don't really talk to them about this because it feels really odd idk. I used to have a therapist and be on meds but we literally can't afford it anymore. I have No Idea what to do anymore ",1753502750.0,2025-07-26 04:05:50+00:00,39,6,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9jum9/i_wish_something_would_kill_me_so_nobody_would/
1m9jqtr,Siento un vacío en mi interior.,"En estos últimos dias he tenido una extraña sensación de que algo no va bien, y ya hace muchos años que no puedo concentrarme en una sola cosa, siempre tengo que estar pendiente a mi entorno por alguna razón. Hasta el momento esto no me ha traído problemas y no es la primera vez que me pasa. Aunque, ciertamente he visto que obviamente no soy al único al que le pasa y he buscado cuáles son las razones principales para esto, tengo miedo de que esto llegue a empeorar y se convierta en algo mucho mas grave.

En términos generales se podría decir que mi vida está mejor que nunca, puesto que soy un adolescente de 16 años que recientemente recibió una nacionalidad europea, voy tan bien en mis estudios hasta el punto en el que en unas semanas comienza mi tercer semestre en la universidad y aunque con cierta inestabilidad mi familia tiene una buena economía, no puedo evitar sentir este vacío.

Algunas ocasiones siento que lo genera algunos problemas económicos a los que tal vez les doy mas gravedad de la que debería pero muchas otras veces siento que es porque me siento solo, aunque disfruto mucho de la soledad física, no me gusta sentirme solo en el sentido de que en el momento en el que yo desee no voy a tener con quien hablar. No tengo amigos y mucho menos una novia pero a veces me gustaría formar parte de algún grupo y poder hablar con las personas de mi edad sobre cualquier cosa que tengamos en común, pero no tengo con quien.

El punto de estar 2 meses seguidos de vacaciones de la universidad no ayuda mucho a mi situación actual y espero de que al llegar de nuevo a un entorno mas social me ayude a tener con quien hablar. Me gustaría que me dijeran que harían en mi situación y francamente a que me invitaran a charlar  un rato. Muchas gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer los problemas de adolescente  deprimido por problemas sin importancia más.",1753502426.0,2025-07-26 04:00:26+00:00,2,0,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9jqtr/siento_un_vacío_en_mi_interior/
1m9jitl,Career is Falling Apart Before It Really Started,"I hope that this can maybe resonate with some people. I hope that I can get some advice. 

In a lot of ways I’m really fortunate. On paper I seem successful but it’s just not translating to any success in life.

I’m a few years out of college and I feel like my career is just nosediving. I had a rough go of it in college. Managed to graduate with a degree in engineering and I thought that once I was put into the real world things would go smoother but they are not. 

By a miracle I got a job out of college. I moved a 1000 miles from home my friends and family a started anew. It was hard. I was lonely. I am lonely. 

It was a dream job, I was getting paid a lot. More than I could have asked for or expected. I quit a year in because I just didn’t see myself progressing. I unreasonably thought that since I landed this phenomenal position at this respected company surely another group of people would find my resume worthwhile and valuable. 

I had an injury shortly after. I needed to move back home to recover and determine if surgery was needed. I’ve never recovered. My joint is broken permanently and I feel the pain every day. 

I had a hard time finding a second job but I got hired. It’s gone terribly. I don’t know what to do and I think I’m on the brink of being fired within a few days. I don’t see how I can recover from this. I can’t get hired because of my degree into another role. No one will hire me because of my lack of experience or “poor performance”. I’m just stuck. With no where to go. 

I feel like I had a shot that everyone dreams of having and it just blew apart in the wind. I don’t know what to do. ",1753501709.0,2025-07-26 03:48:29+00:00,4,3,depression,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9jitl/career_is_falling_apart_before_it_really_started/
1m9jegr,I hate having to hear my mom be dismissive or disapproving of trans people,"My family does a get together every year to celebrate our birthdays. My uncle, who's elderly, asked my sister and I if we had 'any of those pronouns'. My mom's response was, verbatim, 'they better fucking not'. I'm obviously closeted due to my family's..views on non-cis folk, and it really stung to hear her say that out loud like that. She's said before that 'girls aren't boys, and boys aren't girls', as well as said that trans people are just 'looking for attention'. I love her, but I've just been feeling worse and worse with all of the hate. It doesn't help that just a few days ago, she told me that I can live my life how I want as long as I'm happy (and not a bum), and her saying things like the former reinforces that she doesn't fully mean this. I don't know what exactly she'd do if I ever told her I felt more like a boy than a girl, but I know that I'd lose a lot of the support she's given me. I hate that she couldn't jut accept me as me, and that I have to hide things like this from her, especially when the more hurtful things drive me to harm myself. I know she doesn't know the effect her words have on me, but I can't tell her that it hurts without letting on that I'm trans. I just want her to love me for me. She's made it abundantly clear that she sees trans people as 'attention-seekers' and otherwise stupid. She's said that it's not real, and that the people who believe it is are essentially stupid. It's getting harder to listen to her when she says these things.",1753501312.0,2025-07-26 03:41:52+00:00,14,7,depression,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9jegr/i_hate_having_to_hear_my_mom_be_dismissive_or/
