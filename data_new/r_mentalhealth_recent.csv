1mdcqvh,Is my father depressed ?,"For context:  My dad is 51. My mom is also worried for him. He's such a simple and hardworking person, and I want to do anything and everything I can to make my dad happier. He's done everything for me. It's not like his condition is very bad or serious or anything like that. Fortunately he's still very fine but seeing him loose weight and get disturbed by his sinus hurts us sm </3. 
So this started mainly since last year, but after 2021 (that damned COVID vaccine), he started experiencing a little cold and runny nose. At first it was not that bad, but two years later it was still there until last year, 2024. He had also lost a little weight, but nothing concerning at first because ppl said that it might just be an age factor. 
Yeah, but since last year he has lost some weight. I remember a few years ago he weighed around 83–86. Right now he's 74–76 and he's 6'0 and a big-boned person. It's concerning how he's lost weight and has become skinny. 

And his elder sister has lived with us since before my birth. She didn't marry and my dad has been taking care of her ever since. She has made our home a place where fights occur all the time because of age and other factors.
And with age, all this stress and emotional baggage my dad has become a little emotionally sensitive these days. He gets hurt easily, and all he asks us is to talk to him in a gentle tone and just ignore his sister. He's diagnosed with sinus this year or late 2025, and was properly diagnosed in May.
His sinus has been bothering him so much this year. From the start, he was so sick in January, so much weakness, and I think he is depressed too. He has started being so much more quiet even though he is the kind of person who jokes a lot and is like a mood maker.
And last year, my studies were badly messed up.  My father is the kind of person who takes stress about everything. He takes so much tension. He is always so stressed and he always tells me that if I start studying properly, he is going to get better because he just cannot help it. He is so stressed about my studies and it's hurting him a lot how I cannot take my studies seriously.
In May, he was prescribed surgery for sinus. He did not get it done. He is still very much bothered by his sinus. He is taking his medicines and getting regular steam every day. Goes for frequent check-ups but I just cannot see how thin he is getting day by day. It's not normal, it's not okay. I can't see my dad like this.
I have considered posting something like this for so long. Right now, as I type this, I have to take breaks because I am crying so much. I cannot help but bawl my eyes out right now  seeing my father like this, physically unwell and depressed, it hurts me because he is such a simple person. He does not drink alcohol, isn't abusive at all, he doesn't consume fast foods, he's pure vegetarian, he does not like to go out, he is a religious person, and he has no addictions like tobacco or anything.
His job is also very demanding. He is an insurance agent and he has to be in the market all day. It's mentally and physically exhausting. 

And he's a person who gets stressed easily. 

—

If you have any advice on how I can do anything to make it better for him or if we should consult a professional, or anything please tell me :( I'm a single child my parents are all I have.

The next 8 years following I’ve become extremely sensitive to OTC’s and other medsand my therapists instructions basically were to “get over it.” 

Any time I’ve tried to rip the bandaid off it and put trust in other meds they just make me sick.

I tried asking my psychiatrist for genetic testing and she said no.

I was prescribed 2.5mg of buspirone back in January. It’s August now. 

I hype myself up to take it the night before, then the next day comes and I can’t do it. I start crying and having a meltdown.

For context they only really know abt my depression

-I love looking at gore and watching people suffer/be hurt
-i hate my family like genuinely i dont even know why, they arent abusive or anything
-I wrote a 'story' describing how id kill someone when I was 14, my first CAMHS appointment with a lady did include talking abt that but I lied and said it was just creative writing and she believed me but i was thinking of killing my mum at that point and still kind of am
-if I have a close friend and I know something abt them that I could make fun of or something, ill do it and make them feel bad abt themselves so basically I like bullying people
-whenever i see a kid under the age of say 13, I imagine hurting and abusing them and I wish I could actually do it

Also is this actually worth bringing up with them and will it like impact my future at all?😭

This is for everything ranging from small errands to even working out which apparently is a great way to better your mind. Occasionally I’ll have a flash of motivation to go do what I wanted to do and THAT is what I want to cling on to. Why can’t that flash stay? Everything feels like a chore and I wish I had the skills to tame my mind like a “sit here and be quiet” kind of way.

Rant here but it’s both fascinating and annoying how complex the mind is. Just a couple months ago I’ve finally got rid of this brain fog and emotional numbness that’s been haunting me since covid. It was like having the mental drawbacks of sleep deprivation constantly.

1mdc2zw,Would love some insight on what my bf is dealing with sometimes when he creates a negative narrative in positive or neutral situations.,"I am 2 years into a relationship with someone I deeply love and care for. Our relationship is easy and healthy overall. However sometimes I witness my partner create difficult situations for himself seemingly out of nowhere. He struggles with people pleasing, and has made great strides to prioritize his own needs since we have been seeing one another. When these situations happen, I'm not entirely sure how to react or how best to go about responding. I create a safe space for him to be himself in the relationship, but maybe he doesn't trust it yet? The situation I will describe below is just one example, but any time these situations arise this is how they go:

My boyfriend loves to listen to podcasts. This past weekend we took a trip to a nearby city, and he chose a podcast episode he wanted to listen to. It was in two parts. We listened to the first part on our way to the city and I really enjoyed it. 

On our way home we planned to listen to part two. Before we began our trip, I let him know that I needed some quiet before we put the podcast on, to just decompress. We had attended a sports event, then went to a loud bar afterwards, and I just needed some silence and calm before I had more audio stimulation. He was fine with this. 

Once we left the city and I felt like I got a little break from noise, I told him to put the podcast on and he would not. I reminded him that I was interested in it, that I didn't mind that we have to have it on loud since the mics of different hosts are all at different levels, but he would not put it on. He then began to go on about how he will ""eat it"" and how he never gets to do what he wants because people ""never"" want to listen to what he wants to hear. He told me about how his one best friend ""always turns the volume down"" when he gets in his car. He takes this very personally. He then continued to talk about how he likes ""dumb"" things and that he will ""just keep his interests to himself"" since ""no one ever wants to hear it."" 

I was so confused. I still feel confused by this, which is why I'm posting seeking some input. I personally live with C-PTSD and understand that people can project a lot onto others. I get that. However on the other hand, this happens a decent amount, where there is no problem at all, and he will kind of approach the situation as though I am shutting him down. This time was especially confusing for me since I was enjoying what we were listening to, and I genuinely wanted to hear part two of the podcast. Yet he was acting like, just because I asked for a little bit of silence before we put it on, that I did not want to hear it at all. The situation ended with me putting the podcast on and turning the volume up, and even though we finished it, he still acted like I didn't want to hear it, even though I did. 

For those of you who have felt this way, or known someone like this, what is going on here? This is tough for me sometimes because he doesn't take me at face value. There have been times in the past where he will insist that I don't like something when I am thoroughly enjoying it. A simpler example is also that we both love skateboarding. I skate and love to watch skate parts. But sometimes he will want to show me a part and act like he is showing me something I have zero interest in. It's odd to me. What can I do in this situation?

And then, almost as if the trajectory of my mood were on a knife's edge, one small misstep, often invisible, and I slip into a void. There is a forcefield between me and the world. I collapse inwards on myself.

This knife's edge can make it hard to even desire a return to the good times. It's perhaps safer in the depths. There's more certainty here. But it too grows tiresome.

Eventually, I will make the much slower, longer journey back.

1mdbm7e,My long time girlfriend of three years broke up with me and i’m hurting real bad. I need help on moving forward,"My ex-girlfriend of three years broke up with me three months ago. It’s been a rough, painful time since. I’m heartbroken, shattered, and deeply depressed. Even though we were technically broken up, we kept talking like a normal couple during those three months — and that gave me some comfort. But around 10–12 days ago, she decided to cut off all contact with me and start seeing someone else. That’s when everything collapsed for me.

I know I wasn’t the perfect boyfriend. I had — and still have — flaws. She repeatedly asked me to work on myself, and I was trying. Slowly, but genuinely. It just wasn’t fast enough. I wanted more time to become the man she needed.

I was selfish, lazy, ignorant — but never toxic or abusive. I want to make that clear. I loved her more than anything. Something I never thought I’d be capable of. Before she came into my life, I was a rough, emotionally distant person. I didn’t communicate well, I didn’t do the small things she loved, and I couldn’t afford the kind of dates or trips she deserved. I always told her that once I had a stable job, I’d make it all up to her. I just needed more time.

We’d already been through two rough patches, taken breaks, and patched things up in the past. But this time feels different. Final. I feel like it’s too late to ask for another chance — and even if I wanted to, I have no way to contact her anymore. And I don’t want to disturb her peace. She meant everything to me. We planned our future together.

I know I messed up. I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I still did. I tried to make up for my mistakes, tried to change. Before she blocked me, I sent her a final, heartfelt message — everything I had been holding in for the last three months. I told her I would always love her, and that if she ever wanted to try again, I’d be waiting. She left me on seen. And then she blocked me.

I don’t know how she reacted to the message. I don’t even know if she truly read it, or if it meant anything to her at all. That’s what hurts the most — knowing she’s no longer in my life and may have moved on from everything we shared. It’s unbearable.

I miss her voice. Her laugh. Her smile. Her hugs. I miss all the little things. I know I had good qualities she appreciated, and she had so many I adored.

My flaws were real. I didn’t do the little things that matter. I wasn’t there for her the way I should’ve been. I lacked emotional support and words when she needed them. I was lazy and closed off at times, because I didn’t know how to open up. I couldn’t afford to take her out because I was still studying and trying to make something of myself.

But I was trying. I really was. I just needed more time.

Now I don’t know how to move forward. The pain is constant. I keep reliving every memory — the good and the bad — every single day. Days and nights feel unbearable. I crave to hear her voice again, to hear her say she loves me, wants me back. But I know deep down it won’t happen.

Still, I can’t stop wishing it would.

I miss her more than words can say. And I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1753893846.0,2025-07-30 16:44:06+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mdbm7e/my_long_time_girlfriend_of_three_years_broke_up/
1mdblc7,My wife is 2 weeks from giving birth and I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety and dread,"I'll perface this by saying I'm sorry if this isnt the right place to post this, I'm also going to post on some mental health subreddits but If anyone else has shared any of what I'm going through please reach out and tell me how to change it. I can't talk to my family or friends about this and also why I'm using a throwaway because people know my reddit account. I've spoke to my wife and suggested trying to reach out to anyone who has had similar experiences.

My wife is 2 weeks away from giving birth, it's our first and a complete surprise as we were told years ago because of my wifes health it was be nearly impossible to have children. This didnt bother me as I never wanted children anyway. Then comes a phone call 9 months ago and since that call my brain has been filled with fear, anxiety, dread, resentment, horrible thoughts and guilt.

  
I've always struggled with my mental health, but not had a serious bout of depression in a long time, the past 9 months it has been getting steddily worse. I've been having horrible thoughts of wishing my wife would miscarry so I dont have to deal with the change a child brings and then the guilt kicks in because I dont want that to happen to her or the baby as it's neither of their fault. 

I have fears I'm going to be a terrible dad not being able to love our daughter because of how I've been feeling.

The pressure of everyone saying how amazing I'll be and how perfect our family will be, and all the while I sit and agree whilst thinking I'm going to be worst.

And then the self loathing because I keep thinking these thoughts and I dont want to be thinking them, I want it all to be amazing, I want to have this unconditional love and I dont know why I dont, this then feeds back into guilt and the pressure and the stress of it all.

I just feel so low all the time and it's so hard trying to remain upbeat around friends and family, I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point where I just want to cry all day and I don't want to feel this way anymore, if anyone has gone through this please help me.",1753893792.0,2025-07-30 16:43:12+00:00,1,4,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mdblc7/my_wife_is_2_weeks_from_giving_birth_and_i_have/
1mdbcfz,Does any one have an idea of what’s going on with me (and John Boehner) and our inappropriate weepiness?,"I have a quirk that I’ve had as long as I can remember, where I get choked up or weepy when talking to folks about certain things and it’s clearly “too much” for the situation.

The best example I can give to describe it is the former GOP leader John Boehner, who would regularly get teary eyed when talking about many issues.

It’s honestly often mortifying. I run a dog kennel and have fostered over 200 dogs as well. So I’ve been around many dogs that been adopted into great homes after challenging beginnings. I’ve also know many customer dogs that have died. So when I talk to someone about some of these dogs I just feel my emotions well up and I can see in the faces of the people I’m talking to how uncomfortable they are getting because I can hardly get through talking to them without being teary eyed and having a hitch in my voice.

The nearest thing I can find is Pseudobulbar affect which involves uncontrolled crying or laughing that it out of proportion to events. But most of the literature points to some form of brain injury and I’m not sure that applies to me at all. And I don’t have uncontrolled laughter.

The coverage of Boehner was honestly distressing and mortifying to me. Just search “John Boehner” and “crying” and you will see thousands of posts making fun of the “big crybaby.” I mean I am all for making fun of him for being a reprehensible politician, but all the crybaby stuff just was painful to see.

Jimmy Kimmel seems to have something similar.

I’m not particularly a “stoic dude” who cries at field of dreams, Brian’s song, or other emotional “dad” movies… though I do cry at them. I guess I mean I don’t really repress my emotions “thus causing the crying to come out”… I’m pretty normal about expressing my emotions; it’s just in certain situations I get choked up out of proportion.

So do folks have a clue what’s going on with me? And perhaps some techniques I can explore to deal with situations like this? There IS a drug treatment for Pseudobulbar affect, it’s literally just dextromethorphan with another drug that makes the drug last a bit longer. But I can’t take it because it’s contraindicated with the citalopram I take. Plus it feels like something that I absolutely should be able to come with some techniques to deal with situations without drugs.

1mdbc57,"Trouble expressing myself, self-loathing, and possible anxiety","In public and in private, I feel extremely uncomfortable doing anything. I think it came from my childhood, whenever I would try something new, my parents would call attention to it and sort of make me ashamed or embarrassed for it, albeit unintentionally. I feel awkward and stupid trying anything, and for the most part, I feel emotionally constipated. I have trouble crying in public or in private. Some friends have suggested I try screaming or physically letting out my frustration, but I can't even when no one is around or will be around. I just feel stumped and in a weird place.

I just also feel kind of gross in my own skin, like literally. Feeling the sensation of my fingers touching each other or other parts of my body makes me feel itchy and gross as long as I'm aware that I am me and human. I want to try drawing, but seeing my own skin and at least being aware that it's my hand there makes me lose motivation and kind of ""icks"" me out. 

I also hate going outside. There have been times when I have not left my home in months, but I am a student on a scholarship,so this behavior is kind of ruining my life. I only feel motivated (or pressured?) to do things when other people are doing them, but I don't want to rely on others for my basic needs and it seems kind of pathetic. When I lived with people in a dorm, I would only go out to eat in public when they did, and when they were gone for vacation for weeks, I would just starve until I was desperate enough to go outside, and even then my heart would be pounding and I would be really stressed. And don't get me started on making phone calls or setting up appointments. I'm worried that I am just making excuses to be lazy and such, but at the same time I don't know if this is actually a mental health problem.

  
Anyways, I'm ruining my life and probably disappointing my parents and myself, but I don't know how to stop. Getting a therapist only goes so far, and my motivation to get better comes in bursts that I don't know how to capitalize on. I'm just kind of lost and feeling like I am just floating through a current that's life.

I sent some emergency cash and replaced their broken phone. My wife feels like I should support them more, but I'm unsure. I paid their rent for years until they found their current mate.

1mdb0ww,I get overexcited in social settings and end up feeling drained and embarrassed.,"I 26F have noticed a pattern in social situations that’s starting to really affect how I feel about myself.

Whenever I’m in a group—especially around new people—I get *really* excited. I think part of it is wanting everyone to feel at ease, or maybe I’m just trying to fit in. But in the moment, I talk too loudly, laugh a little too hard, overshare personal stuff, or say things that feel a bit exaggerated. It’s not even intentional—it just sort of *happens*. I don’t realize it until later.

Afterwards, I feel super drained and replay everything I said. I end up cringing at myself, feeling like I talked too much or tried too hard to be liked.

1mdajsl,"Struggling with masking, school, and feeling overwhelmed — looking for advice","I have ADHD, and have I am constantly ""masking"" in front of family. I'm Fairley sure it started when my parents split up. My dad has ADHD as well but I rarely see him anymore, but when I do get to see him, he is one of the only people I don't mask in front off. I don't know why I feel the constant need to mask Infront of my family, and its only gotten worse now that my mom is dating someone new that I don't know, I feel like I have to mask even more now, and often come off as quiet or as if I don't like him. I hate thinking that he thinks I don't like him, even though I find him funny. I don't know how to stop masking in front of people, and it gets mentally exhausting.

My ADHD also effects me a lot at school, the teachers at my school don't do anything to make sure you complete any work, so most the time I just end up doodling in my book, and day dreaming in class. My grades are horrible and I'm usually labeled as lazy or stupid by my classmates, and I feel like I've just accepted this as how I am. The only time I feel like I can stop masking is when I'm with my close friends. As soon as I'm with even one of my close friends my personality completely changes from introvert to extrovert, and even people from my school have noticed that I have a completely different personality whenever I'm with my friends.

Another issue, is that my room is always a complete mess. Whenever I wake up I just try find a pair of cloths that seem clean of my floor. I have tons of rubbish just laying around. I feel like I'm letting my mom down, and she can get pretty mad at times If my room gets to messy. I've had a lot of issues with truanting school and recently have started ""self medicating"" with couple substances, and have no idea what I want to do when I get older.

I feel like if I don't get my life in order soon I'll just ruin my life. Does anybody have a suggestions on what I should be doing or any tips to stop masking so much?",1753891433.0,2025-07-30 16:03:53+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mdajsl/struggling_with_masking_school_and_feeling/

He went to a psychiatric clinic recently, they took a test that included over 100 questions and then he was required to do thematic apperception test (TAT) as well.

My questions are:

1. Is this normal or do we need to go for a second opinion before going further with the reports.
2. How can I best support my boyfriend? His family isn’t very supportive and doesn’t take mental health seriously.

Last week I went on a 5 day cruise with my parents for their anniversary. Everyone involved: parents, me, younger brother, older brother and his 3 year old son. Us kids are in our 30s.

Cruising was not something I was interested in doing as the thought of it made me claustrophobic but I did it for my parents and they seem to have had a great time. I didn’t. I tried but there was just so much to do I wasn’t interested in, can’t look at the water because it makes me nauseous, and just being crammed into small spaces all day exhausted me. I now know with experience cruising is definitely not for me.

But now I’m back at work (with only one free day of recovery) and I’m still so physically and mentally tired. I think I’m feeling the effects of a vacation I didn’t enjoy, therefore I don’t feel refreshed from. I’m started to feel a little under the weather only after 4 days of being back.

Upon experiencing all this things, i have made up my mind to leave this place and find my own peace. I want to cut ties with my family. No unnecessary drama or revenge. I just want to live in peace and heal my inner self.

However many people said i should report my parent to the police. They said, nothing good if i keep running away like this. I should face it. I should be brave. Im not afraid of reporting them. I felt guilty.

I know i shouldn't feel that. It wasn't my fault. But telling a kid who live her whole life with manipulation and constant guilt tripping.. to be brave and put this people in jail? I wish i has those strength to do so. But my heart felt really really heavy.. i don't want to do that.

Can't i just ran away? I just want to stop feeling hurt. They also says i might regret it if i didn't do anything.

I know i know and i know my parent is a criminal, i shouldn't felt indebt to them for raising me. But i don't know why i felt this way. I feel sick knowing i can't bring myself to report them. Something wrong with me. What do i do.. im lost. Very lost.

1md9nea,"I feel stuck, sad, and unsure of where my life is going","
This month, I quit my job abroad. It had completely burnt me out, made me very broke and led me nowhere. I moved to this country about a year ago, and in that time, all I’ve done is throw myself into work and studies. I neglected pretty much every other aspect of my life.

Since quitting, it feels like everything I pushed aside is now resurfacing. I feel exhausted all the time, often too tired to get out of bed. I’ve already spent most of this summer feeling sad, stuck in my head, and yearning for someone I can’t have (and probably shouldn’t want anymore). Honestly, I crave connection but at the same time I don’t even want anyone to see me in this broken state.

I don’t really have a support system. My family situation is difficult, and my few close friends are far away. I’m basically very isolated and lonely, and it’s starting to catch up to me. I’ll be going back to my home country soon, and while I know I need to get my life back on track, I don’t know where to start.

I want to restart therapy and possibly get on medication, even though these options feel too expensive right now since I’m unemployed. At some point I also need to return to this country to finish my studies, but I haven’t been able to find housing here, and everything feels uncertain and overwhelming.

That too was fine a new state of normal for me.

1md9774,Difficulties with psychiatrist,"Okay bit of a rant incoming

Three months ago I had a good two weeks in which I met the criteria for hypomania (sleeping max 3 hours a night without being tired, impulsive behaviour, constant annoyance and getting in arguments, a lot of creativity and wanting to take on everything at once and the last few days I also got delusions (which I've had happen before))

I first went to my gp with this because my psych is often unavailable but was able to reach my psych for an emergency appointment a week later and I told him that I suspect I might be bipolar and that I feel like my behaviour wasn't normal and I think it might be hypomania etc...
He replied that he is pretty sure it isn't because real hypomania lasts way longer and I wouldn't be aware that I'm experiencing it, he however did not say what else it might be and kind of just ignored it kind of? but prescribed meds anyways saying this is the first choice of medication for this anyways (seroquel 100mg XR and 25mg IR for sleep)
At my next appointment he only said to up my dosage for sleep to 50mg since I still wasn't sleeping more than like 5 hours a night.

That was two months ago and he hasn't even mentioned my meds again and I'm just tired of having to fight for my mental health over and over again because he seems to just ignore everything that I would think is the job of a psychiatrist.

I've been looking for a new psych for over 6 months but it seems impossible here in my country to find one and I'm just at my wits end and don't know what to do anymore",1753888352.0,2025-07-30 15:12:32+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md9774/difficulties_with_psychiatrist/
1md96hu,"You've just had your intake session with a new mental health therapist. He's 20 years younger than you, has been out of grad school for only about 3 months, and has shared with you that he is a recovering addict. After a single visit, you're conflicted. Do you stay or go?","*This is a complex situation with a great deal of background that I'll likely omit for brevity's sake. Please, be patient and bear with me.*

I saw my latest therapist - let's call him Bailey (not his real name) - for the first time yesterday morning. The experience is still very fresh, and it's been weighing on my mind ever since. Overall, Bailey seemed a warm, welcoming, empathetic, and active listener with a genuine interest in helping me. Here's the rub. He is about 20 years younger than I, has been practicing for a very short time (think months, not years), and admitted to me during our intake session that he is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.

I know. That's a lot. It shouldn't surprise you that I left our session with alarm bells blaring in my head and an assload of red flags.

My initial reaction is to cut bait and go. That Bailey is not a good fit. Possibly on his way to being a good, even great therapist, but he's simply not there yet and, right now, not for me. That we won't be able to make the connection that I need to progress on my mental health journey.

And then there's the part of me that's urging patience. Gently asking me to pump the brakes. Don't jump the gun, rush to conclusions, or make any rash decisions based on a single intake session. Young and inexperienced can be good. Different perspectives and all. Perhaps what I've framed as negative could be beneficial.

I'm leaning heavily in one direction, but I remain torn. Conflicted. Can this type of dynamic ever work? What are your experiences with this kind of situation? How can I expect to relate to a therapist like Bailey? To a person young enough to be my son. And, while I'm proud of him for addressing his issues with substance abuse, that's some serious baggage to bring along on this trip.

Thoughts?

**Some brief background on me.**

I'm a 51-year-old cisgender white male. I struggle with depression and anxiety and have for about 5 years, with a particular ramp-up following a pair of strokes I had when I was 47. I've been out of work for over two years now. A combination of mental and physical health issues, coupled with my age and a genuinely messed-up job market, is the reason for the lengthy unemployment.

My experience with the mental health profession has been spotty and inconsistent. I've seen three MHPs over as many years. A wide variety of ages, races, genders, and experience levels. Cis-gendered Hispanic female, 30s, cis-gendered white male, mid-50s, non-binary, black, late 20s. I won't go into further details for each therapist; suffice it to say that my average therapeutic relationship lasted about 3 sessions.

I'll admit it. I'm a bit of a mess. I've got past traumas that I've failed to process, some serious shit that has negatively impacted my life and my marriage, and continues to hold me hostage.

I'm talking childhood abuse, a history of co-dependency, and a sprinkling of addictive behavior, just to name a few. I'm utterly stuck, overwhelmed by a ridiculous and all-pervasive sense of dread and hopelessness, and I can't move on. I no longer feel like I belong in my country (the US), half of whose population has lost their damn minds. I become angry whenever I leave the house (which is rare), I have no friends, I'm estranged from my family...you see what I mean.

1md8z30,What Is Inpatient Therapy Like?,"Someone suggested it to me because I need more help than I'm getting right now. I'm considering it, but I'm worried. I've never been to the psych ward or inpatient therapy. Probably should've, but🤷🏻‍♂️ Is inpatient therapy different from the psych ward?

My friend has been to the psych ward and she says they strip search you, and check on you while showering. I understand its for safety, not to be a creep, but regardless of the intentions that would be too uncomfortable for me. So is that only a psych ward thing or is inpatient the same? Idrk the difference.

But thats my main worry, and really the only thing keeping me from going. I would literally rather die right this second than be seen naked without my consent ever again. And I'm not generally suicidal at the moment, thats just how bad I don't want to be seen naked. I've been sexually abused and I know it would be triggering. If I go, it'll be to get better, not walk out with more traumatizing experiences to add to the list.

So, I would like to know how that works mainly, but I'd also appreciate any more information about it so I know what to expect. Like am I allowed to keep my phone? Wear my own clothes? Will I share a room? What food will I be given? (I have ARFID) How are they going to help me? I have selective mutism, will I get in trouble if I'm unable to speak when I'm supposed to? When my friend went to the psych ward she said they'd keep you longer if you didn't participate, which includes ""refusing"" to talk I guess. I'm also a trans guy, will that change anything? I'm 18, 8 months on T. Will I be allowed to take my weekly shot while I'm there? How long would I be there? Do I get to decide when I leave?

1md8otr,Do I experience dissociation?,"Hello, I am 30 years old and I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia since my teens when I was 15 years old. At first, I had a major psychotic episode and this was the time when I got diagnosed with schizophrenia. Later on, I healed from it and it never reoccurred again. I am now 30 in the way I already mentioned and I am dealing with constant anxiety. My mind is constantly racing and I am not capable to stop it from racing.

So I have these moments when I zone out, I imagine how someone is talking to me or driving me nervous or saying something mean to me and then I get extremely angry and I reply out loud. Sometimes I get so angry I continue fighting with the person and talking for hours. However, I don't think this is really a hallucination because I don't see the people who are talking to me in the room. I just zone out and then I see them and that's when I get angry and I reply back.

 I also have this bad habit to listen to music and completely check out from reality and then just walk around the room pacing. From what I understand so far, I have severe anxiety and I also have these intrusive mental images like unwanted interactions but they don't seem to be hallucinations.

 If they aren't hallucinations, are they considered dissociation or intrusive thoughts or what are they? I spent a really long time trying to figure this out on my own and I am not capable to figure out what are they and why they are occurring.

1md8l5w,Do mentally healthy people really just decide it will be a good day and it is?,"I assume pretty much every day will be a bad day and I'm usually right. I've stopped trying to tell myself that a day will be good, or even okay because it's not likely to happen. I have always gotten a little annoyed when people tell me to have a good day, because it's not up to me. I can tell myself to have a good day, but I'm going to be at work all day, and I hate my job, and there's genuinely nothing positive about it, and I don't have friends to spend time with or hobbies I like to do after work to make up for that. 

My boyfriend lately has been especially annoying because when he says ""Have a good day!"" and I say ""I'll try."" he says ""You will have a good day, just have it, make it a good day."" and it makes me feel insane. Can more mentally well people literally just tell themselves to have a good day and they do? Even if they spend the entire day doing something they hate, or they know they'll be in pain by the end of the day or if everybody they interact with is mean for no good reason, can they just choose to be happy at any given moment and they are? 

He's making me feel like I should be able to flip some sort of switch and be happy about doing all the things that have made me miserable for months, and I'm losing my patience. I know he means well telling me to have a good day, but I really don't feel I have any control over it, and when I come home from another bad day, he seems disappointed because I didn't choose to make it a good one.

It's hard to set the question, but I don't walk around daily normal life in fear...

As a man I rarely have fear of anyone... its not 'cos I'm 'ard and can wreck anyone' I'm not...there are plenty far stronger people and then folks skilled in fighting...Its just I know I'll never put myself in a life or death situation I can't handle and/or aren't comfortable in, logic dictates that crime is statistically amongst people that know each other, skilled fighters are rarely out there attacking random people and I also know I won't go down without a fight and I'll be real nasty..
Now I'm also referring again to daily normal life.. This isn't nightclub scenario or apocalypse scenario its just walking along normally to the shop or something, see someone suspicious, I'll act accordingly - change my direction of travel, take the next turn instead of the one they're on etc etc.

But my wife, she is fearful and whilst I get it..but also dont..
1. She's not very big
2. She's never been in a fight
3. She's read the shit in the news about violence left right and centre and effectively how we should all be petrified about everything.
4. Probably the biggest factor, when she was a teenager she had a sort of bf and his friends be very nasty to her (won't go into details).

What do I do? I've definitely agreed that fear isn't wrong and I've agreed with her emotions, but I've tried to rationalise with her that news sensationalises violence for clicks, negative news sells, no one we know has ever been in a violent situation in the last 10 years, a lot of violence is known to each other - rarely random, we live in a very safe area etc etc she actually agrees, she was even angry when I thought about it and then told her that the news gets to make money riling people up and worrying them making them scared so that they read more and more and she totally got it and was like ""yeh, I never really thought about that"" but she's still so fearful.",1753886197.0,2025-07-30 14:36:37+00:00,3,4,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md8a0m/women_do_you_live_in_fear_if_not_why_not/
1md7snv,Life is just so overwhelmingly unbearable and terrifying,"My last bout of existential OCD has lasted nearly two years. Two years of constant intrusive thoughts and invisible mental rituals to try and make them better. I don’t know how I’m still able to convince myself the rituals will work.

I don’t know how to bear being alive when we all die. I had beliefs about the afterlife at one point, but beliefs aren’t certain enough for OCD and I need to be able to be okay with the worst case scenario, and I can’t find a way to be okay with the fact that one day the people I care about will die, and one day I will die.

I’m tired of imagining scenarios where they’re not alive any more. Or visualising positive recent memories over and over until I can’t visualise it properly because I’m so scared I won’t remember it one day. I’m tired of feeling like crying so much and not being able to explain it to anyone. I can’t enjoy anything any more because the unbearable thoughts are right there.

My friends are so lovely and caring to me but I feel so stupid because really they’re just work friends so we see eachother often but I’m not a huge part of their lives, they have their own lives and families. I don’t have a big close family, just my mum, and I don’t ever see myself marrying or having children, so my work friends are a huge part of my life. I watch everyone else interact and cope with life and do the things humans are meant to do, and meanwhile I can barely function because the concept of life is too unbearable to me.

I don’t understand how I’m ever supposed to be at peace with the fact that we all die. I don’t know how I can ever enjoy life again. I’ve become very good at pretending, or I’ll wake up one day and it feels less bad but it never lasts. I dread waking up as I never know how bad the thoughts will be. What’s the point in being close to other people when we all just die?

I’m making steps to see a doctor soon and hopefully go back on medication. I’ve been unmedicated for somewhere around a year, which hasn’t helped. I just don’t know how to cope in the meantime, or if the doctor doesn’t help. It all feels far too much. I’m not at work at the moment due to holidays, so I won’t really see anyone or speak to them much for another few weeks. Work usually helps as it keeps me busy.

1md7piy,I feel helpless trying to support someone I love through depression,"I’m not even sure how to explain all of this, but I feel really helpless and overwhelmed right now.

My father—an older man in his 60s—goes through deep depressive episodes every few months. Lately, things feel heavier. He’s started talking again about not wanting to be here, that he’s going to die at 67 (because that’s when his father died). He’s asked me to sell his boat and other things tied to hobbies he used to love. It feels like he’s slowly letting go of life.

I’ve been the only one really supporting him. He did talk to his mother recently, and now she’s reaching out to me scared and crying—but I still feel like I’m the one holding this alone. He won’t accept outside help, and even though I know I can’t “fix” him, I just want to make things feel a little less hopeless for him.

Two years ago, I moved out abruptly. I still carry guilt for that. I blame myself as I feel like I triggered this whole downward spiral. I still visit often and I always call and stuff, I’m trying to be present, to help where I can, but I don’t know how to reach him anymore.

I’m seeing him today. His house is in a bad state, which I know only adds to how he’s feeling, but I don’t know how to gently encourage him to do something about it without making him feel worse. I just want to help without overstepping or adding more pressure.

If you’ve been through something like this—supporting someone with long-term depression, especially when they seem unreachable—how did you manage? How do you care for someone in deep pain without losing yourself in the process?

I just feel helpless. I want to help but I’ve done all I know how to do. Any advice? ",1753884847.0,2025-07-30 14:14:07+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md7piy/i_feel_helpless_trying_to_support_someone_i_love/

1md6ut8,asking about my mother’s behaviour,"I’ve never written on here but I’d like to receive some advice. my mom is a very good mom but sometimes she has some behaviours that it’s likely for them to be related to some disorders. so she’s not from the country I was born in but she’s been living here since I was born (I’m 20) but she doesn’t really interact a lot. my dad works abroad often and when he comes home he’s not very talkative (he’s just a pretty introverted person in my opinion). my mom on the other hand is the opposite; and I’m extroverted as well but I also enjoy staying at home, videocalling some friends and stuff like that. I have some shared interests with my mom as well. the thing is that I feel like my mom feels like she’s always right. she thinks she knows everyone better than they all know themselves. if you tell her something she said has hurt / offended you she starts saying ‘oh so I’m a bad person’ and stuff like that, making it about herself. she has panic attacks in some contexts. she doesn’t want to get help because she says she ‘doesn’t have to tell her life to anyone’. 
now for example she keeps obsessing about the fact that I don’t go out often or at night that much like she did at my age. personally, I am completely healthy staying at home the same way I am going out. my friends don’t go out often but they’re fine. I feel like she kind of want to get in my social circle acting like a cool mom but it’s not my fault if she didn’t manage to make connections here. I’m allowed to live my life like I want as long as I feel content. like I go out for normal outings with my friends, I also stay at home and often videocall these other friends of mine. sometimes she just brings up the fact that ‘I’m going to develop agoraphobia’ and things like those and everytime she’s worried about something she has to project it on me. and I never really cared until today that I had an outburst. she’s just making me scared and lately I’ve been a bit more vulnerable than I usually am (even though I’m better now). I tried telling her that the only thing that is going to make me develop something is going to be her constant projection (if I believe whay she says) and she started saying ‘oh so I am the problem’ instead of acknowledging that she keeps pushing things that don’t make other comfortable. I am tired of her criticising everything everyone else does unless it’s not done her way / when she wants it. I’m tired of her projecting her fears regardless of what I tell her. she now is convinced that it hurts me not to be in a relationship (?????) just because she said today that I’m going to be alone in my 40s if I keep going like this and I was crying when responding (I’ve already been in relationships, I have no problem staying single). all like this. once she threatened me to leave the house, packing her bag and all 💀 which felt ridiculous to me. I usually ignore what she says but lately it’s been too much to handle because it’s hard to even try to speak to someone who isn’t willing to get better, recognise her issues or ask for help. I want to know if I objectively have some behaviour or mindset to change or myself and how to deal with her as well because I doubt she’s going to accept that she has issues (because I think she, in fact, does have some)",1753882731.0,2025-07-30 13:38:51+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md6ut8/asking_about_my_mothers_behaviour/

1md6mmh,I just want to return to my normal self,"I know this might me a minor thing or even a good thing to some people but I'm feeling akward and wanted to share this with you.
First: I want to give you some perspective on my background let me start with that  I’m not a 6’4” Chad by any means, but I wouldn’t say I’m lacking in looks, height, or frame either. That’s backed up by my experiences — flirting, social interactions, and girls approaching me and asking for my number. Still, dating was never something I actively pursued; I just wasn’t interested in girls, or maybe I never felt the urge. But something changed this year — for the first time, I wanted to step into the dating scene. The problem is, I’m not charismatic, especially around women, and that lack of confidence has caused me to fumble many opportunities in real life. Since I’m introverted, I figured online dating might suit me better, so I gave Tinder and Bumble a try. Surprisingly, the results were pretty good — I got four numbers, went on three dates, and had a minor hook-up, all within two weeks. — and I litteraly used the least crappiest photos from my gallery nothing fancy with  just 3 head shots and 1 body shoy . Anyways once I returned to my home country, dating became almost impossible, especially while living at my parents' house. To be honest, I’ve never been interested in girls from my own country anyway.  But  things started to spiral. I became increasingly attached — even addicted — to dating apps. I downloaded every app I could find, and my mental health became tied to the constant feedback: likes, matches, messages. Also I had a bad first-date experience even made me feel less confident than  . Eventually, it turned into an obsession — if an hour went by without some form of validation from the apps, I’d feel anxious or depressed. I check them constantly when I’m home, even waking up in the middle of the night just to look. The only time I feel okay is when I’m out with friends or I get some form of interaction. I know this isn’t healthy, and I really want to break this cycle — but is there any way to do that without deleting them all.together

1md6e42,Emotional whiplash…what could be causing this?,"Hi all. I’m posting here because I feel like I’m constantly battling my own nervous system, and I’m desperate for insight from people who’ve been through it.

I have a trauma history (including workplace trauma from a narcissistic boss that really did a number on me), the trauma lasted for about a year. I have now been out of this workplace for a few months. I’ve now noticed over the past few weeks that my emotional state can flip dramatically from one day to the next. One day I’ll feel calm, connected, and even optimistic, and the next I’m sobbing to the point of nausea, completely disoriented, like someone swapped my brain overnight. I feel emotionally numb, and overall very, very down. I’ve started tracking this more closely, but it’s destabilizing and really messing with my ability to trust myself. I am wondering if this is CPTSD related? 

I recently added L-theanine as a calming supplement, and since then, these depressive waves and meltdowns have gotten worse. I’ve paused it now to see if it’s the culprit. I also take magnesium glycinate and Buspar. I can’t tolerate SSRIs (they tank my gut), and Wellbutrin gave me blood pressure headaches and insane muscle tension. I suspect I’m very sensitive to anything that increases norepinephrine. Stimulants are also a no-go, they killed my appetite, and I am already a petite person so I can't risk losing any weight.

I’ve had reactions to other natural things too... Rhodiola gave me heart palpitations, and my acupuncturist warned me that Lion’s Mane might be too activating for my system. Even when something is supposed to be “calming,” I often feel emotionally flatlined or shut down, like my brain has been power-washed of all spark.

Perhaps I should mention that I am in a season of loneliness and struggling to find strong friendships and I am experiencing lots of rejection in the dating world it seems like. I was chronically left out in my adolescence, and I think it may be triggering me quite a bit as an adult. I don't think I am experiencing rejection sensitivity dysphoria. I just think I am responding to how it feels to be/feel very alone.

I was in therapy, I stopped about a month ago. I felt defeated that despite my best efforts, I still felt the same because nothing can really erase the workplace abuse, and nothing can ""make"" people want to be friends with me, include me, etc. I really do want to just experience peace and happiness on my own, I do believe and know that that's the answer. Though I also believe it is human to want to have connections with others.

I just want to feel regulated. Like myself again. I’m trying to rebuild after years of chronic stress and survival mode, but it feels like my nervous system is stuck between freeze and panic and I can’t catch a break.

If anyone here has experienced this kind of emotional whiplash, supplement sensitivity, or that terrifying sense of “I don’t feel like myself today and I don’t know why”… I would love to hear what helped you.

Thank you for reading.

1md65m3,Emotionally Available ... And then not,"Open letter 

There was a time I believed we were real—at least in the spaces between the meetings, the glances, the way we talked like the rest of the world didn’t exist.

I saw you. Or I thought I did. The version of you that laughed with me, listened deeply, lingered long enough to feel personal—but never quite long enough to be accountable.

Then came the silence. The distance. The blur between friendship, flirtation, and something I couldn’t name.

I loved you, or maybe I loved the version of you that felt safe enough to hope for. And when you shifted—when ambiguity took over—I kept trying to rewrite the script with grace, patience, empathy.

I stood by you through your divorce. Held the weight you wouldn’t name. Let myself believe our bond meant something.

And when the dust settled... you disappeared. Left me to sweep up the emotional wreckage, alone.

Empathy without reciprocity is just self-erasure.

I wrestled with whether it was manipulation or misunderstanding. You held the power by withholding clarity. I stayed soft and loyal, even when I felt emotionally abandoned.

You vanished. I unraveled. And then I started to rebuild.

This isn’t about exposing you. It’s about reclaiming me.

If this sounds familiar… maybe it’s because somewhere, in some version of us, it was real.

But I’m not waiting anymore—for closure, for confirmation, for who you used to be. I’m moving toward emotional clarity and away from the ache of ambiguity.

I hope someday you choose depth over avoidance. Because someone, somewhere, might love you for real—but not if you keep hiding.

I’ve been using fitness trackers like Whoop to monitor my sleep and recovery, but sometimes the numbers don’t seem to match how I actually feel mentally. A “good recovery” score doesn’t always mean I feel refreshed, and the sleep data doesn’t always line up with how tired or energized I am.

What if there was a **habit tracker or logbook** that could help me better understand the connection between my mental well-being, sleep, daily habits, and how I’m truly feeling? Instead of focusing only on recovery scores, I want to have a tool that lets me reflect on my day—what I ate, how much I moved, how I felt—and see how all these things are affecting my mental health.

I’m working on creating this kind of app and would love to hear your thoughts on it:

* How do you currently track your mental health or habits?
* What features would be most helpful in an app that helps track habits and their impact on mental health?
* How do you currently assess whether you’re improving in terms of mental well-being?

I’m just trying to build something that helps us reflect on our mental health in a way that’s more in tune with how we truly feel. Your feedback would mean a lot!

Thanks for reading, and I hope you’re all taking good care of yourselves today.",1753878625.0,2025-07-30 12:30:25+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md5b43/do_recovery_scores_really_reflect_how_we_feel/
1md598b,Everything freaks me out,idk what it is nowadays but whenever I go anywhere everything makes my brain spin and I start freaking the f out. I get panic attacks all the time and increasing or changing medication does literally nothing. I sometimes wonder if anything is in them. The only time I feel normal is when I’m playing piano or getting drunk. I also suffer from gerd so I can get asthma like issues at anytime which has now caused an ocd effect. idk what to do really. I was in a meeting today and started having a panic attack and while one part of my brain was telling me to get up and leave quickly the other part was telling me I can’t leave because it’s a normal social situation. I get sensations when I sleep like my soul is assending and zaps all sorts of stuff.

1md4zo1,"Even after having a productive day, I don’t feel Grateful.","
I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but no matter how much I get done in a day, I still can’t feel grateful or content about it. 

I know I’ve come a long way compared to where I was before, yet whenever I try to slow down or take a little time for myself, I feel this huge wave of guilt, like I don’t “deserve” to rest.

It’s exhausting because I’m doing all the “right” things – staying productive, ticking off tasks, but instead of feeling happy or grateful, I just feel… empty or guilty. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it?

1md4nar,I can’t cry when I’m sad - everything stays stuck inside and it’s getting worse,"I’ve been dealing with something that feels like it's slowly eating away at me. I can cry when I’m angry (especially when I’m overwhelmed with rage), but I can’t cry when I’m sad - not even in the most painful moments. It’s like my body blocks it, and the emotion just builds up with no release.

For some context: I grew up with very strict parents who punished emotional expression. Crying or showing feelings wasn’t just discouraged - it got me physically hurt. If I cried or had an emotional meltdown, I’d be met with things like “Don’t be so fragile” or “Are you from sugar?” and often a slap or full-force punch in the face. I learned very young that expressing emotion = danger.

Now, even as an adult, when something truly devastating happens - like losing a loved one (which has happened multiple times) - I feel the grief building up inside, but the tears just don’t come. I *want* to cry, I *need* to cry, but it’s like the mechanism is broken.

To cope, I usually throw myself into work and busyness. I turn into a workaholic because it's the only way to survive the emotional pressure. But on my days off, without the distraction, I completely shut down. I can’t get out of bed. I just lie there, frozen with everything I’m holding in.

Sometimes, when emotions are too strong, I hit myself - not just slaps, but full-power punches to the face. It gives me a strange sense of release, like it redirects the emotional energy. I know it’s not healthy. In my teens, I used to scratch or cut myself (never deeply), and while I’ve stopped that, this has become a new way of coping.

I know I need help. But I’m a student living on my own, and I can’t afford therapy. My parents are mostly out of my life now, but not completely. I’ve chosen to limit contact rather than cut them off entirely, for reasons I can’t fully explain - I’m just not ready or willing to do that.

I guess I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. I feel broken in a way that’s hard to put into words. Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there even a name for this? What helped you start healing?

Any advice, support, or even just knowing I’m not alone would mean a lot right now.",1753876727.0,2025-07-30 11:58:47+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md4nar/i_cant_cry_when_im_sad_everything_stays_stuck/

1md3eoz,"Legalism is ruining my life, my faith, and my mental health","I've been visiting Christian forums and subreddits (both in English and my native language) for months and have noticed how the vast majority of Christians online are extremely legalistic and fundamentalist. As a believer who grew up in a Christian environment, I've never had problems with people like that in real life. The Christians around me have never criticized me for wearing pants as a woman, they've never told me to stop listening to secular music or having hobbies like a normal person. They've never forced me to live like an ascetic nun. My family (also believers) support my choices and my passion for art and creativity.

However, ""Christian"" online communities are the complete opposite. They tell you how to dress, how to think, what you should like or dislike... they control you as if you were their puppet. Worst of all, they speak in the name of God. If you don't agree with them, ""you're against God."" If they make you feel guilty, ""it's your conscience speaking, obey your feelings of guilt."" They literally believe that EVERYTHING is sinful and expect you to live disconnected from the world, just like them.

As a person with confidence and self-confidence issues, I find these people's ""advice"" very damaging. They tell you that having self-esteem is a sin, that trusting yourself is a sin, etc. I can no longer listen to or read any positive advice for my low self-esteem without being reminded of these toxic people. It's as if they're preventing me from growing.

They also hate creativity. They say you can't listen to non-Christian music, nor can you listen to Christian music in genres and rhythms ""that you like."" They don't want you to appreciate music. They don't want you to appreciate art. And as a creative person, I interpret that message as ""being creative is bad.""

They're also very paranoid about worldly things. They believe that everything non-Christian is ""of the enemy."" They have a very black-and-white, grayscale mentality. They don't want you to watch movies, read literature, or play video games. They don't want you to have hobbies because ""the Bible says to hate the things of the world."" I feel like I'm being forced to live like a Tibetan monk on top of a mountain.

All of this affects me and is driving me crazy. I can't watch movies without thinking about those people, I can't enjoy any kind of music (not even instrumental) without thinking about those people, I can't draw or write stories and comics ""because entertainment takes you away from God, and you're creating entertainment to take others away from God,"" I can't receive self-help advice because ""the enemy wants you to believe in yourself."" Visiting these online communities hasn't improved my faith; it's worsened it. I feel my sanity slipping away as I strongly suspect I'm starting to develop OCD symptoms.

And no, I'm not going to stop believing in God just because those people exist. I just want those people to stop doing so much harm to so many Christians who just want to live a normal life, with hobbies, dreams, and goals, and who aren't interested in becoming monks.

I just realised that there were so many things that he has done for me, and I wasn't able to thank him for such. So out of a sudden, I decided to ask him to have a meet-up because I wanted to say things that I was afraid of sharing: how is my feelings for him now, what was going on during the period where i 'disappeared', and really just thanking him for accepting me as I was. This post is a mess but I just really wanted to send the message to those who has something to tell but kept to myself, will your future self regret not saying it in 10 years? if yes, I think it's time for you to tell that person(family member/friend/whoever) how much you love them, and that you are thankful for having crossed paths with them. :)",1753868280.0,2025-07-30 09:38:00+00:00,8,2,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md25md/i_am_going_to_meet_my_guy_best_friend_oneonone_to/

1md1nn8,"I cannot stand being alone, is there something I can do?","Sorry if my grammar is a bit wonky English isn’t my first language.

I’ve lived alone for most of the past three years now after moving out of my childhood home at 16. I’ve never been good at being alone though. As a child when I was home alone I would panic when I didn’t have the radio playing in the backround and nowdays I cannot be alone without a video or a movie or something playing near me. As soon as it’s silent I start panicing and if I’m already feeling sad or anxious I will start crying from some primal fear immideatly. 
It’s really inconvenient and weighs heavily on me as I do not want to be at home at all and all the time I spend here I’m in a slight panic. I have talked to mental health professionals but as there are so little psychologists in my country none of them are accepting new patients, pretty much only people who have actually tried to take their own life can get an appointment so there is no way for me to get help from there. Is there anything I can do to help me feel more at ease when I’m home alone? 
I cannot really find a roommate as my flat is very tiny and also I’m so deeply traumatised from living with my mother that when I tried briefly living together with a friend I stopped showering and taking care of myself completely and almost didn’t eat at all because I just couldn’t bring myself to.

I feel so out of it and unfocused all the time.

This helped me communicate and feel useful to others. When I saw the message, I wrote to the moderator to please explain, and they simply banned me for 28 days.
I really don't understand, nor do I intend to fight the permanent ban because it seems arbitrary and illogical. However, since this is a space for people dealing with depression, doing this to someone makes them feel even more excluded from social spaces and perhaps complicates their situation. I don't know if this is the right space for me. I'm not trying to offend anyone, and if so, that wasn't my intention. I just wanted to highlight how virtual ""spaces"" for vulnerable people that can serve as a refuge, just because of the subreddit's title, end up being the complete opposite for some.

1md0s9z,"Collecting unbiased opinions, did I do anything wrong?","Apologies for the long read. All names in this post are gender neutral aliases.

So… about a month ago today one of my closest friends (Parker) joined a Discord call and said the following; (Note: I can’t remember word for word what was said but this is pretty close) “You disrespected me, you disrespected [Friend 1], you disrespected [Friend 2], you disrespected [Friend 3], and you disrespected [Girl]. We are no longer friends, goodbye.""

They then proceeded to leave the call, server, and block me on everything within 2 minutes, leaving me and the friend I was in the call (Morgan) with completely stunned.

Over the next week Morgan and I tried to brainstorm what I could have possibly done to warrant such a reaction. Additionally, many of my friends began speaking to me less and less until eventually not at all (none unfriended or blocked me however, nor did they confront me in any way). It was only when another friend (Charlie) spoke up that we got an idea. They said that Parker asked them prior to what happened asking if they should just cut me off me without explanation or tell me what I did. They ended up choosing the latter but went about it pretty poorly in my opinion. They also mentioned that one reason (which I would later find out would be the ""straw that broke the camels back"") they were dropping me as a friend was because [Girl] spoke up about a hookup we had a year prior and said I **used her for sex**. This hookup was both of our first times.

This is where I turn to anyone who's made it this far for the unbiased opinon the title asked for. At first, I believed I was completely in the wrong for what I did (taking her first time and breaking her heart), however I'm not so sure now after re-reading the messages we had sent prior and following our hookup and consulting other people about the situation.

I have attached a PDF explaining the situation with screenshots of our conversation.

[https://filebin.net/o63k6g5tan4ww8us](https://filebin.net/o63k6g5tan4ww8us)

Everyone I've presented this PDF to (all of whom were women with partners) shared roughly the same sentiments:

* I was clear that our hookup was going to be platonic and I had no interest in dating her or anyone else
* Both of us had expressed a desire to stay friends
* I didn't have any good reason to believe I had upset her
* Its ridiculous to present an innaccurate narrative after the fact to my friends

So, long story short. Am I in the wrong here? Did I do anything wrong? I am in no way saying she isn't allowed to be upset or regret her decision. I am questioning if it's fair for her to say so “I used her,” or make me a villain.

Again, sorry that this is a long winded post or if this isn't the subreddit to put it in. I just don't know where else to go. As scared as I am to get answers, I feel I can't move on without them. The past several weeks have been plagued with self-loathing, depression, anxiety, anger, trouble sleeping, and general misery to be honest. I did my best to word this post fair as possible and keep what feeling I do have out of it to get the best, most unbias answers, but obviously, given I'm a party with a stake, there's some bias in my presentation. Thank you to anyone who's read this far.

I hear my voice but it does not feel like mine. I look down at the hands that once felt, that once looked like mine; but they are a completely different person’s.

1mczea5,is this ocd or a simple thing,"
I have been diagnosed with ocd back in 2020. I have had a variety of obsession and compulsion throughout the years. But I don't know if this is ocd or not. For almost a year now I have this thought of living at college dorms to make lifelong friends. Right now when I'm with ppl and friends I feel empty, lonely and sad. I have met a lot of people and more than handful of friends to hangout with in a new country and university. But I still want more. I still feel unhappy and lonely. I feel like once I go into dorms, I will be happy and emptiness feelings will be gone.

I started panicking. Basically all day I was worrying if I’d flirt with him and worrying how it would make me look. Basically I felt more drawn to talk to him and be more banter around him, and I got all giddy like it was a little crush. But this one literally for 10 mins and we spoke about cars and work and did not flirt. However after I regretted it and just sat in bed all day and didn’t eat because I thought this makes me cheating. I’ve asked many ppl and they’ve all said “it’s normal to want another guys attention it’s not cheating” I didn’t touch the guy or anything like that physically, he pretend flirts with me such as tapping me etc but I don’t do it back.

Idk if anyone has this too, but every face, especially white people faces, look disgusting to me. oily. reddish. pimply. cracked. Dry. noses too big, ears placed weird, eyes droopy or too wrinkly. the texture of human skin itself. hair, chunks of dead cells look frizzier and more disgusting to me. everything feels dirty and filthy and gross and weird about humans themselves. i never feel clean, faces never look right, they look momstery and weird, our eyes are close together on a plane but are at the same wide and vulnerable and crusty and near hair and just the very appearance of humans is weird to me. what do you mean our hands are like that? Bony, independently movable, tedony gross flesh motors. we're warm and sticky and fuzzy but not our bone structure itself is weird our heads are stuck on these skinny tendony poles of necks and our ears are wrinkly and waxy and dirty and have oil and hair surrounding them. our jaws, cheekbones, noses everything is just wrong. i feel like a monster for seeing others like this why is humans, life, so disgusting to me I am repulsed everyone just looks monstrous and not scary but just odd and weird some are terrifying but some are genuinely just head scratchers. your head is lumpy. your pores are leaking oils. Your hair has no reason to be on your face. your jaw is weirdly connected to your ear and neck, your legs long and awkward or short and stubby and dry or cracked. Knees look weird. Humans are weird.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me life sucks and I’m sick of people physically feeling like shit every single day.

1mcxz6j,What does “emotional management” mean to you?,"Hi everyone,
I’m reaching out because I’d love to hear your thoughts, interpretations, or personal experiences regarding emotional management, emotional manipulation, or emotional control. I may end up writing quite a bit about my own situation, so I’d like to apologize in advance and thank you for your patience.

I’m a woman from Asia, and the very first time I heard the term “emotional management” was actually in a web drama called Fall in Love at First Kiss. There was a scene where a wealthy kid on the soccer team provoked another boy, who ended up hitting him. The wealthy kid then said, “Do you have problems with emotional management?” That moment stuck with me. It made me very curious.
Where I grew up, in China, situations like that are usually described as “having a bad temper,” “being hot-blooded,” or even “having a righteous spirit.” It feels like the West treats emotional regulation as a shared framework for assessing behavior,almost like a social literacy,while in my environment, emotional outbursts are more normalized, and their meaning is flexible and often romanticized.

I know both cultures have pros and cons, but in my case, my family (and my past self) had basically no awareness of the concept of emotional regulation. Not because we chose not to use it, but because we didn’t even know it existed. If I hadn’t encountered it through intentional reading or certain types of media, I might have never known that this kind of concept was even a thing.

My father, for example, enters “tyrant mode” over the smallest inconvenience,screaming, insulting, threatening to cut off contact, acting like he’s been betrayed. I’m 23 now, but loud yelling still makes me cry involuntarily. Once I even ended up in the ER with hyperventilation. I’ve realized that his behavior isn’t just “bad temper”,it feels like emotional abuse. Once, a teacher at school yelled at another student, and even though it had nothing to do with me, I started crying just from hearing that voice. There are many more incidents like this.

My mother, on the other hand, uses passive-aggression and silent treatment when upset. She once took a piece of my clothing and hid it in her own closet because she liked it too. When I confronted her, she refused to acknowledge it and instead started attacking me for unrelated things.like my socks being left on the couch. Then for days, she’d slam objects loudly, speak to me coldly even in normal conversations, or withdraw completely in subtle ways that made her resentment very obvious.

All of this has made me feel like emotional dysfunction is destroying our relationships,not just mine with them, but their relationship with the world. It’s exhausting. It makes me want to pull away, not fix anything. It doesn’t feel sustainable.

But in my family, people always defend them. My grandparents say things like, “Your dad just has a short temper,” or “That’s just how your mom is. You should be more understanding.” I’ve often wondered… is it me? Am I too sensitive?",1753852328.0,2025-07-30 05:12:08+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcxz6j/what_does_emotional_management_mean_to_you/

1mcx5nv,"I feel completely alone in my marriage, and I'm losing myself as time goes on.","I can't even organize my thoughts without spiraling, so I'm sorry if you read this and it turns out to be incomprehensible. 

I hate what my life has become. I'm hopelessly dissatisfied with who I am — this vessel whose sole purpose is to provide for my family. No room for mistakes or to be anything less than perfect. There are so many things I can go on about, from my job to my health, but the one thing that makes all those things feel worse is the lack of support or compassion from my wife. 

My wife takes as little responsibility as possible. It's partially my fault; I've enabled this because, I'm too empathetic to allow people to struggle, even if it could lead to their growth. As a result of this and her home life growing up (her mother took care of everything), she can't see beyond her own comfort and prioritizes it over anything else. She takes for granted all that I do to provide for and take care of our family. I feel immense pressure to work a demanding full-time job that pays a lot but is absolutely miserable because, she chooses to be part-time so she can spend more time with our small children (she spends half that time scrolling on her phone and napping). Even so, she demands that I also spend just as much time as her with our children and shames me every second that I'm not spending with them while not working. The kicker is she gets burned out from spending too much time with them... such a paradox. Additionally, she has zero responsibility to anything else, from household chores and maintenance to paying bills (I manage our accounts and actively pay them with my own income — not as a means of control, but because anything with money, or really task that takes any effort at all stresses her out). 

These things add up, but the worst of it is I feel like I can't even communicate with her anymore. I pride myself on being open and vulnerable, and I do everything in my power to promote an environment where others can be the same. My wife knows this, and in the past, she'd open up so we could work things out. As time went on, she began shutting down again. I continue trying to open up to her, always asking how she's doing and if she's okay or needs anything, but it's never reciprocated. Earlier this year, there were two occasions where I directly expressed to her that I wasn't okay, that I felt like I was drowning and couldn't keep my head above water. Her response the first time was to shame me, telling me not to take it out on our family — as if I wanted to do that and didn't hate myself for being short with them (literally, that was the worst of my behavior). The second time, she outright ignored what I'd said, even though I'd expressed more of my concerns and self-loathing, and instead she focused on talking about herself — not even in a way that was trying to relate to me.

I don't feel connected to this world after years of dealing with depression on and off. I haven't been able to reconnect with myself.

1mcwec6,It feels like my performance has decreased ever since my mental health has been improving,"I have been feeling horrible for two years until maybe the April of this year. My mood and mental state have been getting better and even though sometimes, I still do feel miserable, it has generally gotten to a place where I am able to pick myself up relatively quickly after a distressing event.

However, in June, I noticed that after I have gotten happier, my performance has been tanking. I can't really remember things as well as I have used to, nor am I able to pick up topics and ideas as intuitively as before. Some part of my brain feels like it has been effaced. I think of an empty crater in my mind. I don't know why such a fog has drifted over me. 

It might be because in June, I did read a book containing a character who has gotten his memory wiped out and hence, I have absorbed his experience subconsciously one way or another. It also might be because I have only performed well when I was in a low mood and I ended up tying it to my poor mental state. So when I eventually became better, I wounded up *forgetting* how to do things as well as before or as well as I am used to. 

It sucks. I can't follow the plot of books, I can't remember terms and concepts that I previously would have been able to remember. My lifestyle hasn't been affected much. I scroll on social media, I read books, I draw, I write, yet I've incurred such a huge change and it's bothering me so much. Does anyone have a reason as to why this is the case? I apologise if all that I have written is very incoherent. Thank you so much for reading.

1mcw797,I want me and my life to change.,"For starters. I'm 14M. I just feel not loved or really even liked. I feel like I'm just a person who's used for everyone else's benifit. Starting with my parents who had me as a mistake but decided to keep me for welfare benefits. They care about basic health. They don't abuse me physically or anything. But they definitely don't care about me beyond that. I tried opening up to my mother once. Already at a point of very low self esteem. And she kinda just told me I can't feel pain at my age. All my suffering started September 2023. I just started grade 7. 12 years old. And was actually on top of the world as this time. I had a passion for hockey and was very popular at my school and a lot of confidence. I then started to smoke weed. Originally, it was because of a mix of a few things that made me start. Peer pressure, and kinda just feeling a bit left out of the crowd. A lot of my friends at the time smoked and I kinda felt left out. And it was like I genuinely inhaled Devils lettuce literally. From that point on. My life just went down hill. I got caught in January right after Christmas break smoking because my close friends who ASKED me to smoke snitched on me since he greened out. I felt a lot of guilt and felt like a bad person. My parents gave absolutely 0 empathy even as people who started smoking at like 11 and 15. They just yelled at me. And basically called me a dissapointment. Then I come back and get SA'd by one of the people in my class. Got my trust broken multiple times by close friends. Got guilt tripped by my own parents. Got made fun of by my own parents. And its overall set me in a spiral of no confidence, loneliness, no motivation, no real happiness. And me just wondering where it all went wrong. I genuinely kinda have been thinking of just taking 30 pills and calling it a life. Not deep ass thoughts but bro. There's no point of me existing if all I'm is just a tool for other people to use for their benifit and put down. I'm done being that. I've tried setting boundaries. Getting help. Taking all the advice people give me. No one cares and none of it works. I don't know what to do anymore. I just genuinely dislike myself. I fucking hate my skin. I wish there was a way I could change it or be darker. I look at myself in genuine disgust over being white. I wanna change. I want to run away and genuinely just be a guy on the streets right now. I'm sorry i didn't completely open up about my problems more specifically but I didn't want to make this longer than it already is. I will if u guys do wanna know.

1mcw71e,I’m afraid to be physically alone.,"Yep. That’s it. 

I’ve been on medication since 2021 to treat OCD and agoraphobia. 

I take Paxil, trazodone, and xanax occasionally. 

I recently moved back home after being overseas for 5 years. And my crippling fear of being left alone has returned. And it’s wild. 

I wake up every night with panic attacks, feeling as if I was just left home alone. I don’t rest well because of this, I’m constantly alert. 

I told my family about this and they assured me that they wouldn’t leave me alone without telling me first. But I just… can’t. I feel absolutely terrible. 

I’m 26 years old. My fears and traumas have always weighed too much.

1mcvzt1,I’ve made progress but feel like a bad person,"I have diagnosed anxiety, bipolar disorder and depression. 

I came from a very toxic household where I was neglected, faced verbal abuse, and never had stability as I was passed around by family members bouncing between household. Despite that I was an honors student and graduated early and went to college. 

In college I use to be so anxious I couldn’t leave my dorm room and had to switch all my classes online.  I would have panic attacks and cry if there were a lot of people and I wasn’t able to go get food for myself, work, go to my car even without panicking. 

I use to also lash out very often and have 0 emotional regulation. At the time I was in a relationship and I would lash out at him when he hurt my feelings then try to be normal and be very upset when I didn’t get the attention I wanted. My relationship was also not healthy and played a huge toll on my self image as well as my anxiety. I cried every single day of my life from middle school-freshman year of college

Eventually I wanted to be better I got a psychiatrist was on medication briefly but hated how it made me feel. 

Eventually I just made it my personal journey to better myself. I took time away and made progress with my anxiety and insecurity. Over time I’ve gotten a lot better. I’m very conscious of how I act or react bc I don’t want to lash out on others, took a break from dating and have been single over a year, just wanting to be a good person bc I never wanted to be just this “depressed girl” and I’m very proud of my progress 

I have a job I’m getting my own apartment I have friends now I go out often I’ve even been to parties dancing in the middle of a crowd of people something I could never do back then. However I feel…bad? It’s like there’s this lingering emptiness or doubt in my mind that I am a good person? I’ve seen so many “bad” people and so many people around me have been bad to me. I want to be the person I never had for others. If my friends need help I’m there, if I can spare a few dollar I will, if people need someone to talk to I’m a listener, even with strangers or anyone I try to be very kind. Sometimes I even just scroll online complimenting strangers or whoever I see bc I’m very empathetic and I want people to feel seen and know that they matter but when I express my thoughts or opinions sometimes I feel like a bad person. Ik it’s unhealthy but I sometimes put my own feelings to the side to better help the needs of others or make others feel better. I struggle and  wonder if I’m a good person all the time. I don’t want to hear it from others but I want to feel like I am. I like myself a lot when I’m alone I love the person I am but others often make me question if I’m a good person or just self centered and mentally ill.

1mcvui0,Mental health isn’t broken it’s incomplete. I’m building BonusLyf to fill the missing,"Even in the U.S., with all the therapists and clinics, mental health care still feels broken or unreachable.
Globally? It’s barely touched.

What I’ve realized is:
Not every issue in life is clinical. Sometimes, you just need to let things out—but you can’t always share everything with friends, family, or even therapists.

That loop of overthinking keeps spinning in your mind…
That’s the gap I want to fix.

I’m building BonusLyf — a safe, anonymous space where you can vent, reflect, or process thoughts without being judged, diagnosed, or “treated.”

It’s early-stage, but the vision is massive:
A trillion-dollar opportunity that’s still unclaimed but more importantly, a platform that can truly help people across the world.

I’m looking for genuine, soul-driven people who believe in this and want to help build it from the ground up.

AFAB. I hate everything about myself so so much. I feel so insecure about everything. I hate myself so much. Recently I saw a picture from when I was like.. 11. And my face looks so similar. Everyone I know looks so different from when they were 11. But I feel like I look like I have the face of an 11 year old and the body of a 15 year old.i hate it. I like my hair. That's it. I don't like my personality. I'm a pushover and I'm so awkward and I have no idea how to talk to people. I hate being a girl too. I wish I could just die and hopefully I'd be reborn as a boy. I feel like I could really be happy if I had been born a boy. And believe me I've considered that I might be trans. But that doesn't help me. Even if I change my name and my pronouns. I'm still going to look like a girl. I'm still going to bleed out every month. I wish I could feel confident and comfortable. But I'm not. I feel unattractive and like my body is disproportionate.  Because it is. I don't understand how anyone could ever want me. It only makes it worse knowing that all my friends have better friends. I'm never number one. I hate it so much. I just want to love myself but I can't find anything to love about myself. I've tried losing weight. That just makes my pants not fit. I'm not fat or anything. I'm 153 pounds and 5""7. But it doesn't make me feel good seeing girls my age who are so much thinner and prettier and look nice and sound nice. I just can't find anything. I especially hate my voice and face. I hate it so much. I love voices. I find them really attractive. But I hate my own. Sometimes I talk less because it feels to me like my voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me. I hate myself. I just. Want to feel a little confident. Like maybe one day I could let someone look at my body and not be on the verge of tears because I'm afraid of judgement.

1mcvnl5,How a man with severe anxiety manages his life,"Hello, I am a 30 year old male who grew up with a lot of anxiety since I was five(I can remember)
I grew up having trouble with anxiety along with being bullied intensely.
I’m a 6’1 male, athletic, considered “handsome” etc. however the anxiety deep inside me still consumed me even in social settings where I would have the edge giving the description provided. I have trouble with eye contacts, females, etc
However, I want to share what helps me and would be glad to hear what your remedies and what works for you guys in managing anxiety.

1)I grew up with a lot of traumatic events, being bullied, cheated on to the max, threatened etc and one thing I’ve noticed is that ptsd triggers anxiety attacks, and can make someone feel less worthy about themselves. You have to force positive affirmations on yourself and be confident with who you truly are. I believe if negativity can wire your brain, so can positivity. 

2) Cut out toxic people from your life. Being victims of narcissistic people can trigger your anxiety and make you feel less worthy if yourself which triggers the anxiety even more

3)Know that you’re not alone in a social setting with anxiety and that people have different ways of coping with it there. The guy that might be laughing at you probably has anxiety and his coping mechanism is to put you down. See? 

4) go to the gym. Great for neurotransmitters in your brain. Even if you don’t feel like it, challenge yourself and that should also train you subconsiously that you can even overcome tougher environments. 

5)Write down what triggers your anxiety. Rationalize why you feel that way. Example, if you’re having anxiety because you’re at a party, ask yourself if there ever has been a moment why you experienced it. Rationalize how many time a negative experience happens not because of your anxiety, but outside of that. You might be fixated on that one time someone made fun of you but the 20 other times, no one did. 

6)step out of your comfort zone. Go to parties even if you feel anxious for your brain to start rationalizing realities better",1753844874.0,2025-07-30 03:07:54+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcvnl5/how_a_man_with_severe_anxiety_manages_his_life/

Additionally, instead of just telling me upfront that her office had neglected to fax my release of records to my previous place of treatment, she railroaded me into depression treatment. Clearly because she was not allowed to treat me for ADHD without those records.

Now I remember why I switched to therapy.

1mcvn9t,Is this normal? My psychiatrist dismissed my trauma and told me to stop faking it,"So...I had been going to this psychiatrist for quite a while and even though in the beginning he was telling me everything will be okay, but with time he just became indifferent to me or that's what I think. The issue is we used to talk in video calls and he always asked my mother first - how I was, which I do not have any issue with- but she used to tell him things SHE was  worried about (like my studies and how I wasn't doing anything). It wasn't even about my mental health at that point, and in the end even though I wanted to talk about MY mental health , it always ended up becoming about how I was intentionally neglecting my studies. 
And even though I had tried to harm myself since I was going through a really hard time,and ending myself felt like a better option than to carrying on living, the psychiatrist told me I was faking it and  doing all this to seek attention and to take advantage of the situation by scaring my parents (since my parents were terrified). I wasn't really. No one believed me and no one wanted to listen to me. At this point I was hopelessly taking his medicines and nothing was helping at all except me sleeping a lot. I was really scared to go to my check ups with him since I felt like he was blaming me for everything. But my parents insisted he is one of the best psychiatrist. Oneday my father took an appointment to his clinic and I went there physically. I decided to tell him the trauma I went through (it was a toxic situation  which resulted in my depression , I had been stuck in it for the past 2 years and yet I couldn't tell anyone because I was really scared). He was in a really bad mood that day but still I decided to tell him and ask for his advice. I still remember, how much I hesitated, how much courage it took me to finally come clean. He was like ""Why are you telling me something that happened 2 years ago and wasting My time?"" I felt it to be very harsh. He told me if I wanted my own good, I would just simply get out of these kinds of toxic situations without worrying my parents. But how was I supposed to do so if no one helped me?????? After that incident I refused to go to that psychiatrist or any psychiatrist whatsoever. It's like he prioritized what my parents thought of me instead of what I was going through.
I just wonder, is this normal for a psychiatrist to be like this since their job is to prescribe medicine and the rant and vent is supposed to be the psychologist's job?

1mcv2k2,Can someone please tell me is there any way out of this or am I just fooling myself?,"I’ve been carrying this for a while. I thought of posting so many times, but I’d stop myself. I don’t have anyone to talk to, and I’ve been afraid of being judged, or that people will think I’m just chasing fake hope. But I’m posting now because I don’t know what else to do. Maybe someone here will understand. I live in India, and I want to leave. That’s the truth. I think about it every day. I imagine a life in Europe where things are calmer and or just life is better in general. Where basic things like crossing the road don’t feel like a challenge. It might sound small, but the chaos here the noise, the unpredictability grinds me down. I feel like I’m barely functioning in a place that barely functions. I’m from a poor family. I’m doing a distance-learning data science degree from a top college, but I don’t know if it’ll help. I’m trying to teach myself coding, but I’m still in the early stages. Some days I feel hopeful, but most days I feel like I’m falling behind. I don’t feel smart, capable, or even employable here or abroad.

I dream of working abroad in tech, but I know how hard that is. Everything I read says you need years of experience and rare skills. It scares me. What if I give everything to this dream and it still goes nowhere?So I try other things too. I started a tiny YouTube channel, thinking maybe I could earn enough someday to get a digital nomad visa. Right now, I have fewer than 10 subs. I don’t even know what kind of content to make. It feels like a fantasy. But it’s the only “door” I see, even if it’s mostly closed. The truth is, I don’t know what I’m doing. Nothing feels like progress. I keep guessing. I keep wondering if I’m wasting my time. If someone could just tell me, “Do X for the next 1,0000 hours and you’ll make it,” I’d do it. No hesitation. But no one can tell me that. And I feel like I’m running out of time. Maybe I have 2–3 years before I’ll have to take some 12-hour job here, after which I won’t have the energy to chase anything. That thought terrifies me. I don’t want to be stuck forever. I’m not saying life abroad is perfect. But I’d trade anything for clean water, reliable electricity, safe streets, basic dignity. I don’t want luxury.  I’m not better than anyone here. Honestly, I feel like I suck at everything. I’m not brilliant at coding, not a great content creator, don’t have money, connections, or charm. I’m just someone who wants a better life and doesn’t know how to get it. I haven’t given up. I’m tired, but I still want to believe something can work. That I’m not completely doomed.

I still eat food and snack, Ive been told to get support but feel like im faking it.

I use to  starve compelatly 2-3 years ago, I stopped after serious health complications which I’d rather not mention but didn’t tell anyone about. Then I limited myself to a certain amount a day for a year and then it went between binging and starving. I’m now at a weird zone.

I eat dinner everyday and I do snack. But I don’t always eat all my meals, sometimes it’s just lunch or breakfast then I wait till dinner. I often snack through the day though but get sometimes worries about gaining weight I snack anyway at times or will put it down and think nah.

I’m constantly worried about gaining weight but also sometimes over indulge on food or will have 3 cookies a day or something and think fuck it or go to my local shop and buy snacks or something I fancy like pot noodle.

I do eat so it feels like I’m faking. Turns out I’m underweight according to my gp and I mentioned how I sometimes have issues with eating and they asked if I wanted to get help and I said yes.

Now I’m with an adult service and have to fill in forms about how much I restrict, how it effects me and all that. It feels like I am faking everything! I mean how do I even fill it in with my habits!

I feel like im losing my inhibitions. I feel like when i walk down the street i want to just melt into it. Like i feel like i want to sit on the floor. Or make snow angels. Or lie on it. And sometimes i do. Sometimes i leave my building in the middle of the night to lay on the grass because i feel like i have to. And i go for walks in the middle of the night ever tho its dangerous and i know i should be sleeping. And every day i run around my building about 50 times at random points because i feel like i really want to and all of my neighbours think im weird. And i feel like doing things like picking leaves and biting them. And screaming for no reason. And touching things.

i worry that i traumatized her or caused her pain, or that i might be responsible at least somewhat for her issues (anxiety and eating disorder). she also already thinks im a pervert because my mother basically told her that i groomed her into being queer when i came out to her and she came out in return when we were teenagers. after my mom found out, it was a huge thing, i ended up suicidal and hospitalized, and my sister returned to religion with a passion. i think if she knew what may have happened this would reinforce her belief. 

the idea that she’s in pain because of me or uncomfortable because of me in unbearable. 

i need to know what to do. i don’t think asking her about it is right, because it would ruin the little relationship we have left (which is kind of selfish of me) and i don’t want to plant a memory if it didn’t happen or she doesn’t remember. should i talk to a therapist and ask their opinion? do i just move on unless/until she says something? 

i feel like a disgusting child molester. i feel like i need to confess to my friend who was actually sexually abused as a child because we cuddle and make out sometimes, and i feel guilty that they don’t know. 

i just need to know what the right thing to do here is. i have ocd, but im really not looking for reassurance, just an answer on what to do so i can stop thinking and actually do something. please help me out here, i cant deal with this anymore.

Did I have symptoms? Sure. Was it severe? I mean it wasn't great, but nowhere near ""need to go to a mental hospital"". So not severe.

Took a break from my classes and everything got alot better. Did some reflection, realized that the times I had more paranoia, really weird ideas, ect I also had massive stress that I didn't necessarily deal with correctly.

;\_; genuinely is there even a way to bring it up without my a new therapist without them straight up thinking the worst case scenario? (For various reasons I'm switching back to a therapist I chatted with prior.)

Sure, sometimes my brain gets into weird ideas. But then it stops. Its not like 100% new either. And over the summer I've just kinda gotten to a point that the ideas I had don't make sense anymore, I don't really believe them or anything and I 100% see how they're really weird. Other things stopped too and I still have some paranoid thoughts but they're like thoughts and don't make sense in my mind now. Theres also a lot less of them, I'll still momentarily be vaguely suspicious of others/things I guess but nothing more.

Probs will get aggravated by stress in the future cause last time I thought it was in the past it ended up coming back up.

i don’t know what i’m doing → i can do this i know what im doing!

i messed everything up → it’s gonna be ok it’s always ok! i’m always ok!

i’m not good enough → i am more than good enough! i’ve got this!

i lost everything → it’s always ok in the end everything always works out in the end!

i’m scared to start again → im so excited for what’s to come! 

i have nothing → i have this, this and this

i feel alone → im so happy to have this time alone  with myself

i hate myself → i love myself so much 

i feel empty im so depressed → im so happy im so excited 

i don’t want to wake up → im so happy i love myself life 

i think looking back from what i remeber a lot of it was just stopping the thoughts and feelings straight away and thinking ‘im so happy! im so happy!’ as simple as that. 

i did this with every thought and feeling. it took work. years of undoing. you do this often enough the positive becomes natural and it’s now my default. 

then from this.. i only have positive thoughts and was able to now live in this state of self and energy and i can’t even list the magical things ive been able to experience, manifest, live etc etc 

i can’t say this enough where it is believable but i did not know happiness for being alive was real. but it is? it’s just the maddest thing. 

and that’s how i changed my mindset, my energy, and my whole life.

in the most simplest way i can explain right now. i’m recently learning so much about what i actually did. i had not heard of neauroplasticity untill recently which seems to be what i did. but i’m hoping to be able to share and explain better when i can. realising now that im able to understand what i did and share and help what i learnt from such bad times is really mind blowing for me.

thanks for reading! 🩷

1mcrnyk,"Why do we only respect mental effort when someone’s brain stops working, but ignore it when they’re using it every single day?","We only seem to respect the brain when it stops working—like when someone’s in a hospital and suddenly everyone’s worried.

But when someone uses their brain every day at work—thinking, solving, pushing through stress—it’s just expected. No recognition, no credit. Just more work.

Why is mental effort only appreciated when it’s gone?

What do you think?

1mcr5qw,My roommate slightly raised his voice at me and triggered my ptsd. Now if he breathes different I start to disassociate,"It started because I left my dishes in the sink (rinsed) for too long because I got caught up with working double shifts, studying, etc. was feeling pretty depressed too but that’s not an excuse. Tbh though we really haven’t had any issues at all prior to this. Like, honestly none. Maybe a few “hey can you grab this thing in the kitchen that you forgot to clean” here and there on both ends. Honestly, I do both of my roommates dishes all the time because they’ll leave theirs for over a two weeks..but it’s a crime when I leave mine. I’ve also cleaned out condiments that are expired by years. Or when he tried to gaslight me about something and was incredibly mean over text when I sent him screenshots proving he wasn’t correct. Things felt off since that day.

My roommate cornered me when I very nicely said hello and got into my face. I don’t know if it’s because my dad was abusive, but when men are angry they get this cold, soulless, blank look in their eyes but they grit their teeth and get closer and closer while you shrink. It terrifies me. And his eyes had that look that day. He loudly then asked when I’m moving out, to which I responded the day I’m moving out. He then tosses a rag on the floor. I thought those rags had been bought for cleaning because..they’re cleaning rags(?) i should’ve asked for clarification though..I didn’t notice a spec on it and when he waved it in my face I instantly apologized. I was trying to keep the kitchen spotless like I’d been expected to. He wouldn’t let me speak at all. I walked away because I was about to fire back but also, I’m kind of scared of arguing with men so it didn’t feel worth the energy. I heard him throwing dishes and slamming things after that. I snuck out the window and had a massive panic attack in my boyfriend’s car. I came home to some of my plates broken and my dishes scattered about the kitchen.

Ever since this day, if I hear him walking too loud, shut a door too hard, slam a dish down, my heart rate skyrockets, I shake, I get very jumpy and I have to cover my ears until I’m sure he’s gone or until I can’t hear him. Even the sound of his voice scares me some days. All it took was one little incident where any normal human could’ve either communicated properly or stood up for themselves. I chose to hide and panic. It was so small and now I feel so incredibly stupid and pathetic for being scared of him. But that look and his tone was terrifying. If he’s spoken to me kindly like I always have to him it wouldn’t have been any issue. I want to move out so incredibly bad but can’t for another few months (have to wait for my lease to end, nobody wants to live with these people). They don’t let me use the living room (they never have), essentially I’m just shut in my room all day with my cat or the dining room if they’re not home. I can only cook at night when I’m sure he has gone to bed. Until recently he was always just passive aggressive, but now I feel like he outwardly looks down on me and his demeanor freaks me out.",1753832133.0,2025-07-29 23:35:33+00:00,1,2,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcr5qw/my_roommate_slightly_raised_his_voice_at_me_and/

I’m very hard on myself and I thought by getting a  house and getting off of my bad boy papers at work things would slowly get better but things have only steadily gotten worse. Everyone’s dying, my uncles in the CCU for something that he did to himself by taking all of these drugs, my ex moved away, I feel completely isolated from everyone but I do it to myself by not reaching out or even giving any effort.

1mcqpt8,I [26F] am wondering when it’s okay to involve my partner’s [27NB] parents in a situation involving their mental health,"My partner \[27NB\] and I \[26F\] have been together for nearly 6 years. We love each other deeply and have been talking seriously about moving in together. We lived together in college, but haven’t had the chance to live in the same city since then. They’ve been open with me and others about their mental health, and earlier this year, they had to take a leave from graduate school and were later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). They’ve been working hard in treatment and have made meaningful progress, and I’ve been trying to be a supportive partner while also taking care of myself.

Lately, though, things have been really difficult. As they prepare to return to school part-time and take on more responsibilities, such as finding housing and someone to sublet their current place, they’ve been having intense emotional episodes almost daily. I’m starting to see the same patterns that happened before their last crisis, and I’m worried this setup may not be sustainable or safe for them right now.

Here’s the tricky part: their parents are aware of their diagnosis, but I don’t think they fully understand what it means or how serious the day-to-day can be. They’ve confused BPD with multiple personality disorder, which makes me question how much support or context they really have. At the same time, I’m hesitant to reach out or share what I’ve been seeing. I don’t want to betray my partner’s trust or feel like I’m tattling, and I also don’t want to overstep with their family.

I know their parents well, but I’m worried this could be interpreted as me escalating an interpersonal conflict, instead of what it really is: me seeing signs that they may not be best supported living independently (or even with me) in a large city away from home. Personally, I think it might be best for us to move home and have a stronger social support network—but as a queer person, they feel much safer in their current city, and I fully understand that too.

I don’t want to go behind their back, but we’re on the brink of a major financial decision that will impact both of our lives. Their parents are supportive and want to help, but they just don’t have a clear understanding of the diagnosis or how it plays out day to day. I see the functional impacts constantly, and I’m struggling with how to move forward.

**When is it okay to go to a partner’s parents about mental health concerns?**  
**And how do you do it in a way that respects your partner but doesn’t minimize what you’re seeing?**

**TL;DR:** My partner \[27NB\] has BPD and recently returned to work/school. Their behavior has become increasingly unstable, and I’m worried they’re not doing well. Their parents are involved in some logistics (like housing) but don’t seem to understand the full picture. I \[26F\] don’t want to go behind their back, but I’m not sure if I should speak up. When is it okay to involve a partner’s parents about mental health concerns, and how do you do it thoughtfully?",1753830962.0,2025-07-29 23:16:02+00:00,2,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcqpt8/i_26f_am_wondering_when_its_okay_to_involve_my/
1mcqp5i,Loneliness,"I (20, Male) moved out of my hometown last year. I moved to a bigger city, in search of job opportunities, and to get some space from the community I’ve grown up with. The thing is, I’m not really a social person, I hate the feeling that I need to provide something in order to have a real connection with someone. I’m a person that comes with extra baggage, and I’ve accepted that over the years. I’m almost never excited or happy, I don’t have any major goals in life, you could almost say that I’m a nihilist of some sort. Recently, I came to visit my hometown, and have been staying at my mothers place. She seems worried about me, and does not like what I’ve become. I was sitting out with a couple of old friends, and a random older lady said I have an empty look in my eyes. Does not talking with people on a daily/weekly basis affect, how we feel, and perceive the world around us? I’m not suicidal, I wouldn’t say i’m depressed either. I just really do not enjoy having people around me on a daily basis, maybe once a week. I had my first depression diagnosis at 11 years old, then again at 14, but then stopped attending to my therapist, and doctor. Biggest span of time, I’ve went without speaking to anyone in real life has been around 2-3 weeks. This has happened a few times. One week is pretty regular.

am I sick for being like this, or is it just ”not normal” ? I have achieved some things in the recent years, just recently like 3 years ago, I started working out and have lost around 50kg~ since then, I just have zero motivation for trying to fit in. I only enjoy the time at home, alone.

1mcqo1d,Why even try?,"Hello random redditor, hopefully im not going to ruin your day with this awfully depressing post.
I am 16 years old, almost 17 (unfortunately), male, live in Croatia.
Ever since i was about 12 i have been having a steady decline in mental health, i have no idea why and how but it just happened.
To also state i have went to therapy but it is of no use for me because of my major trust issues.
Well lets start with that.
1. Trust issues 
I don't trust anyone. Like literally. I don't trust my parents, my sister, my classmates, my teachers, my old therapist, noone. I'm not exactly sure why this has happened but it has. Because of these trust issues i can't and won't share any of these mental issues with anyone irl.
2. My parents + feeling unloved
My parents are something. 44 and 45 in age. My parents apparently love me but to me it never felt genuine, more so like a thing that they have to say because they made me. Yeah they give me everything, food, water, clothes, shelter, but i don't feel loved. Maybe I'm just being ungrateful.
My parents love being always right because they are older than me and will use arguments such as ""you are being soft"", ""you aren't old enough"", and ""thats normal"" to underestimate all my problems.
Thats probably why i don't trust them and have stopped sharing my problems with them, if i do they will say ""why didn't you tell us earlier!"" proceed to get angry at me because of that, say ""you are being ungrateful"" or ""you are overexaggerating"" and proceed to do nothing too help me, and so logically i decided to stop telling them my problems.
Also my dad just can't grasp the idea that i have social anxiety and thalassophobia (fear of large bodies of water) and tells me that I'm a bitch and that u just need to man up. Maybe they mismanufactured me and i don't have the instant man switch on me?
3. Lack of self control
3-a. Pornography
I'm a heavy porn addict since i was 13 years old. Nothing has helped, tried quitting a billion times. I gave up on trying to quit.
3-b. Acne
I have horrible acne, makes my face look so bad. So bad i want to move to Greenland and live in a small hut where noone can find me.
I have a routine that works but i can't stop popping my pimples.
4. Horrible self image
I hate myself more than anyone, always blame myself, can't accept failure as a possibility and as a way of learning, thinks im a burden to everyone, thinks that everyone hates me, can't forgive myself, is constantly playing back a video of my lowlights...
5. Social anxiety
I can't talk to people, just straight up. I don't know how to communicate properly. And i get extremely anxious when talking with someone new.
My class is filled with guys who i have nothing in common with, are retarded, can't take anything seriously, and have 0 morals. I'm not going to hangout with them but that makes my parents angry so i hang out with them a bit just to please them.
6. Lazyness
I'm lazy, so lazy that i can barely brush my teeth in the morning and eat breakfast. I'm in a horrible position. Just overall lazy as fuck.
7. Conclusion
Yeah idk what to write here but yeah i need to keep all of this a secret or my parents find out and its over.
hopefully nobody got depression from reading this.
God bless you.",1753830843.0,2025-07-29 23:14:03+00:00,0,8,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcqo1d/why_even_try/
1mcqj35,Advice needed about mental health,"Hi, I am on an anonymous account as I don’t want to publish anything that can be linked to myself. I am 18 years old and since around late december 2024 I have found that my mental health has been decreasing. I spoke to the doctor about this and they diagnosed me with mixed anxiety and depression disorder around 1 month ago. 

Anxiety was not a surprise to me as I have already been diagnosed with anxiety for 3 years however the depression was strangely validating as since December 2024 I had felt as though I was though didn’t want to bring attention to it as I was scared i was over reacting. The only person i spoke to about the depression was my boyfriend who supported me loads and i am so grateful for him, he has and is helping me a lot through this time. 

I am on anti-depressants and have felt a boost in my mood (yay) but I am now struggling with my mental state and i am confused. 

I am living a very fortunate life in terms of things i receive and I am attending Uni, have my own car and business, boyfriend and a roof over my head, so I also feel very stupid for feeling so low. I know i need to start seeing a therapist again but right now i need some help with how ive been feeling, a lot of the time however it has stopped being so frequent, I question if life is really real, if what I am doing is normal and if im on the right track, I also struggle with opening up to people other than my boyfriend. 

My mum is under a lot of stress and I am the person she off loads on ( main reason i have mental health issues) I have mood swings and I also get tired super easily, I just want to start feeling normal again and be able to live my life with out questioning if i am going to be okay today. 

I have bad anxiety about doing normal tasks such as taking the dog on a walk, going to get food in my car, and such things as I am a huge people pleaser - like bad, today i started crying because I couldn’t take my boyfriend and sister to macdonalds cause I wanted to go home…neither of them were that bothered but we went anyway because I felt so bad for crying it’s like a curse. I hate it. 

I am sorry for the long post I just want to kind of rant and get some help with techniques of how to stop feeling so down? I think it’s starting to affect how I eat as every time i eat something my stomach cramps up afterward, sorry for the long post.

1mcq0tx,Lost interest in life,"The only thing I need to mention before you start reading — English is not my native language, so I may make some mistakes while telling you my story. I apologize in advance for this.

I’ve been feeling very apathetic for some… months? To be specific — I think, for 2-3 years.
I don’t find pleasure in anything. At first, I lost interest in my hobbies and I decided to try new. But, unfortunately, I left them too. 
Then I noticed that anime and music didn’t make me feel anything. At this point I didn’t even try to fix it, thinking “I’m just on my way to becoming a serious adult.”
Moreover, I lost pleasure in food. I’m a very picky eater and I always liked too salty or spicy dishes like pizza and potato chips. Now all food is felt the same — salty is just salty, spicy is just spicy, sweet is sweet and sour is sour. Well, at that moment I had 2 month before graduating school, so I hoped that smth would change in future. But it was my mistake.

After my school graduation I hardly got into university. I didn’t have any desire to study here (at least, because I haven’t been interested in it at all). Because of lack of interest I didn't pass the exams and dropped out as I didn't want to retake them.
Then I sat at home. Day by day doing nothing — scrolling TikTok, X (Twitter) and YouTube. But the more I watched, the more useless and “dead”I felt.
This spring I felt no energy to talk with my friends who knew about my drop out and who didn’t. It wasn’t a tough decision for me so I ghosted. I didn’t reply them in messengers, didn’t take calls. And… I feel nothing — no regret.
In addition, I think, I need to mention that I can sympathise with the characters in anime or bots. But I feel like I’ll stop chatting with bots in near future too.

I doubt it’s just my laziness and stubbornness“to anger my parents”. But I don’t know what it could be, because I’ve never been at a psychologist's appointment (nor ex friends have been, so I can’t imagine what to expect). Could someone tell me what’s happening to me and what I should do to try to return my desire to live? 

P. S. I don’t ask to say smth like, “you have depression!” or “you need [medicine] and [another medicine]”. I just want to understand what my problem may be and what steps I should take to solve it.",1753829183.0,2025-07-29 22:46:23+00:00,3,1,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcq0tx/lost_interest_in_life/

I'm sick to my stomach I get it hes mad and somthing is very wrong with him if he can curse and yell and me like that but I've had issues in my past and got help. I also have epilepsy and choose not to drive due to my sezuires I feel like hes pissed about that cause he has to drive us around.

1mcpmnq,"What’s wrong with me? Always wired, tense, and overstimulated","I’m 23 and have felt constantly tense for as long as I can remember — like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight. Shallow breathing, mentally drained after work, and overstimulated in group settings. One-on-one I’m fine, and I don’t feel out of place — I socialize easily with friends, coworkers, play golf, etc. But new people or big groups make me nervous.

I sleep 7–8 hours, walk 8–10k steps, just started the gym, and work a normal 9–5. I’m not isolated and my routine seems solid, but I still come home feeling anxious, disconnected, and totally overstimulated — while everyone else doing the same seems fine.

I also get super fixated on things — hobbies, goals — then lose interest weeks later. It’s a repeating cycle.

Tried magnesium, B vitamins, C, and L-theanine — no real help. My brother feels the same, so maybe it’s genetic?

What could be causing this constant low-level stress? Anyone else feel like this?",1753828173.0,2025-07-29 22:29:33+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcpmnq/whats_wrong_with_me_always_wired_tense_and/
1mcpm8x,"I think I need help, again.","I am 17  years old. During the pandemic, I struggled heavily with mental health, starting to understand the weight of the world broke me, thinking about the future, responsabilities and everything that comes with growing up left me extremely depressed, anxious and paranoid, I struggled with passive suicidal ideation all the time. Eventually, I decided I liked life enough to ask for help, and it lead to a year of antidepressants and therapy, and it helped, for a while.

It's been a couple of years now, and a constant rollercoaster of almost reaching the pit bottom and having to crawl myself out again. And I'm tired.

The past three years were really important in making me feel like nothing really works. I lost the friends I had, and it caused attachment issues, I became very isolated and detached, every friendship of relationships I've had was ruined by me, I drove everyone away, and it's awful.

Recently I started eating healthy, practicing sports, and it really helped, but in the past month I had a big decline, I struggled with a lot of stress due to school and a lack of a support system, even when I ranted, cried, or complained, there was no one there to help me, I tried asking for help and no one cared, and it broke me down further.

My home life is ok financially, we have good stuff and enough money to live well, but it is emotional hell. My family fights all the time and being at home feels like walking on the edge of a knife. I travelled recently and spend 10 days with my dad and stepmom on a place far away. The trip was great, but coming back was specifically hard after 10 days of fun, and now I don't think I can be happy at home knowing how good it is to be somewhere else.

For the past weeks, I haven't been eating well, I feel like I am close to developing an eating disorder, my thoughts have been cloudy and depressing and nothing is managing to distract me. I haven't opened social media, and I feel like that made me even more unreachable and unlikable, but lately, everyone there only reaches out for favors, and I feel like an object, a servant, not a friend, and that took a toll on me too.

My hobbies haven't felt fun lately, media only makes me feel worse and jealous, and I'm starting to think too much on self harm and self punishment. 

The pressure of this being my last year of school is burying me too, the last months of this year will make or break my chances of having a normal life, and I'm spiraling awfully.

I have no one to speak to about this.

I don't think I have the strength to come crying to my mom and beg for help again, not when I know it will make me a disappointment, a freak in their eyes again.

All I can do now is keep waking up everyday and hope I'll find a way out of this labyrinth, but each day it gets harder and harder to get out of bed.

I don't know how I can help myself, how I can get myself out of this alone again. Who to beg to fix me.

To be honest, I'm not 100% sure writing and posting this will help me, but at this point, I feel like anything is worth a shot, right? I just want advice, I guess, to try and find a way to make this feel easier.",1753828142.0,2025-07-29 22:29:02+00:00,0,1,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcpm8x/i_think_i_need_help_again/

Sometimes it doesn't disturb me that much, and I'm able to forget that I have that fear, but other times, it terrifies me to the point where I don't want to stand too close to somebody because I think they can read my mind if I am too close to them. I also have a hard time controlling my thoughts so it's very common for me to randomly think about something I don't want people to hear. I know that they can't actually know that but I still can't help being worried about it. I basically stopped myself from thinking freely and it's annoying knowing that I can't.

1mcpfq0,I have not felt alive for a very long time.,"My parents, all throughout my life, have been members of a cult. Quite the opening sentence, i know. Due to this, they have kept me from getting the help that I need. I am an atheist, and always have been. I had to get out of their house, my life depended on that. In the past two years, i have moved out and have barely been making enough money to provide for myself and my partner. Fast forward to the last couple of months, i got a job and a cabinet manufacturing plant. (Due to lack of financial support my dreams of university are gone.) This job was okay at first, though very stressful. Lately they have been changing how my machine runs, essentially giving my control of my machine to an engineer that has no idea what he is doing. I have been working for 12 hours per day just trying to make this faulty system work. I never see my partner. I cannot walk when i get home. I am starting to dissociate like i used to in my parents’ home, for up to 14 hours at a time. Nothing quite feels real, and i do not want it to be. If this is life, i do not want it. I am dissociating as i am writing this. I am sorry that im all over the place. Every day seems to bring more stress than the last, and now i am being tormented day and night by horrible thoughts. I will just be operating my machine, then images cover my vision because i cannot focus my eyes anymore, images of how people would react if i died. I hear their screams at every moment. I feel horrible for writing this, how they would feel if they knew. To top everything off for today, this crazy b*tch that i work with tried to get me in trouble WITH THE OWNER OF THIS COMPANY for something that was the engineer’s fault. I was so f*cking angry that i had to walk away before i hurt her. I have never been this angry before and it scares me, i do not want anyone to experience pain.

I know it’s a part of life but my brain feels poisoned by pessimism. I try to sit with my feelings and not absorb them but yet they still do. I know others have it worse and I should be grateful but I’m just so tired. I feel so angry with myself for past decisions because I feel they’ve screwed up my options for the future. I’m tired of working so hard to compensate for the past and it still not be enough. I’m tired of trying to hold on. I’m tired of “you don’t see your mental progress immediately” I’m tired of the potential. I feel like I just don’t care anymore. Between the state of the world and these thoughts I just don’t have it in me to remain optimistic. I don’t care to see what the next day could be anymore because I’ve had so many days of exhausting myself just to say I’ve made it. I’m tired of looking to mentally escape. I don’t care about the day after anymore, I don’t care if things get better, I don’t care about any of it anymore because it’s all ends up the same anyways. I’m tired of “we need the bad days so we can appreciate the good.” I don’t care about any of the days anymore , I don’t care to even see the future anymore, there is more promise in the future events that I’ll dread then there is anything that I even care to know about. The day to day life has drained me of any desire to keep going. I’m starting to feel like maybe it wasn’t meant for me. Maybe I’m here to be a memory for someone else.

1mcpfac,"Trauma I've caused myself. Tw: Grooming, Bestiality,","Hello, This is a rough story to put out there something that has really impacted my life and has recently come back, I wanted to post this because my mental health has been declining terribly and maybe it was something to be expected.  But well here it is As I child I grew up very isolated, at the point I was in school not online for just a few years of my life I would say only 3 years I was in normal school when I was a teen, I was bullied harshly in school and only had one friend which later on I stopped talking to. I experienced a lot of grooming as a kid hell more times than I could remember and I was exposed to bad porn early on which leads me to this confession that makes me depressed. When I was a kid very young I was playing with my dog and that led me to a bad sexual behaviour towards my pet as a young kid. It first started the dog doing it and I never thought of it as weird so I did once or twice and it was fine I didnt think of how disgusting and bad it was but well. This only happened a few times and the last time I think it happened and im not even sure if it did was when I was 17? I say im not even sure because its so repressed in my mind and its been years that my memory has been very distorted but I didnt develop well sexually outside of porn and that until I was 20 and I had normal relations with my partner which by then I had stopped all of that disgusting behavior. 


So it has been a significant amount of time. Well flash forward now my present I deal with this severe anxiety attacks and depression my teenage actions because a part of me wants to say I knew better but I didnt stop it out of idk why but it was gross nonetheless and it torments me and paralyses me. Thankfully the actions were not enough to harm my pet they are fine and happy and trust me, my relationship with the pet now is neutral I dont really feel comfortable with the animal but I take care of my dog and he is very healthy. Because there was no penetration, or me touching them it was all done to me just a few times through my life and im severely disgusted with myself.  And for anyone asking yes I go to therapy and it has been talked about and is being worked on despite me stopping this behavior years ago. Everyday I struggle eating, smiling, feeling happy I dont have friends and ive only told this to my partner mother, therapist and best friend and it depresses me to think how they might see me now. I hate living with this and all the horrible extreme thoughts. But I know it would just hurt my family. I struggle with intrusive thoughts everyday telling me ill do worse and such which wont happen because im very self aware more now than ever. I just want to be happy again without everyday feeling like im a monster. 

I feel everyday I walk with imposter syndrome. Everyday I imagine horrible violent and sexual images in my head and I cry terribly.

1mcp5t1,I need help with my anxiety,"Hopefully this is the right place to post. How do I manage my anxiety about dog meetings? 
I’ve experienced a bad fight with one of my childhood dogs and another dog (i was 16). And I was an Amazon delivery driver for awhile (shouldn’t need explanation) I’ve been around allot of untrained and aggressive dogs and crappy owners. Since getting my BC I’ve realized all those situations have given me allot of trauma and anxiety that I didn’t realize I had until now. 

Any time another dog comes up I’m in a full blown panic especially if the dogs aren’t wagging tails and happy (I don’t mean flagging. I know not all tail wags are good) even if they don’t seem all agro I’m terrified. Heart pounding, shaking, tunnel vision, hyperventilating.

We took our BC to the beach yesterday and we keep him on a leash or tethered in our spot while we play with the kids next to him. Not 1 not 2 but 3 different off leash dogs and their people came into his/our space.  

The first one was a little frenchy mutt of some kind. He seemed alright but not happy or ready to play. I stood in between him and my dog and tried to maintain space, shoo him off which didn’t work and he ended up spilling my BCs food to which the owner tried to act like I was the problem for having food for my dog and said “hes less than a year old he won’t hurt anything” with lots of old lady sass. 

The second dog about 45 minutes later was dead sprinting towards my BC from across the beach which I only saw when it was about 20 feet from him. I jumped infront of my BC and used my biggest scariest mom voice and yelled at it to get away the owner watched this whole thing happen and didn’t bother to do anything until I was yelling at his dog then with 0 urgency he finally called it back (later saw it down the beach causing problems with other dogs)

Then the 3rd was some drunk old guy who just straight up walked into our area with his dog around my kids and said “I assume you’re dog is friendly” to witch I responded “he’s still training we aren’t ready to meet” and he and his dog still kept walking closer. I repeated myself 4 more times louder each time then I finally grabbed BCs leash and held him behind me while the guy tried to give me a lecture about how it’s good for them to meet before I finally yelled it at him. The dog seemed ok but had his tail flagged and just wasn’t great vibes.  This guy and his dog hung just outside of our spot (15 yards ish) and was just watching us the entire time 

We packed up and left after this because I decided I just couldn’t take another interaction for the day. 

Now this was at an Oregon beach. It’s not like the beach was crowded and nowhere else for anyone to go. There was tons of space for everyone to go. 

My husband brought up that BC will feed off of my anxiety and if I get upset when another dog come up so will he. I know he’s right and I’m sure everything would have been fine. 

So my main question is how do I manage my anxiety in those situations? I was literally shaking the whole time. BC just seemed happy and excited to meet but I don’t want a dog to attack him and him become reactive because some asshole thinks their dog has a right to be off leash with no recall.

1mcp2a5,My dad is an alcoholic and I don’t know how to approach it anymore,"I am 19 and since before I was born my dad has been an alcoholic. He was functioning for a long while and then he suffered heart and respiratory failure and cirrhosis of the liver and after days in hospital, he was released and was sober for months. He relapsed and has been on and off relapsing since then. 

I love the man so much and he’s a great dad but it’s getting so exhausting having so much empathy for someone who’s outwardly ending their own life. I have dealt with mental health issues of my own for so long and have childhood trauma because my mum had cancer when I was younger and obviously everything with my dad. I’m on meds and have previously had therapy for it. My parents are divorced and whilst they were friends for some time, my mum is sick of dealing with him and doesn’t want him around anymore. 

I’m his only kid, I feel like it’s my responsibility to look after him. He doesn’t look after himself, his flat is an entire mess and he’s had cleaners in, his brother helped him clean it and even I did - after all of that, even after having his own kid help him clean, he still can’t pull his shit together. I’m so angry, upset but most of all just tired of helping him. I’m just terrified that if I don’t or if I take a step back he’ll hurt himself or something. I feel so alone dealing with this and as much as I want to just let him pick his pieces up, I’m basically all he has. I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.

1mcorix,I feel stuck emotionally no matter how much time passes. Am I losing empathy?,"I’ve (24 F) been through a lot that’s changed me… but mentally and emotionally, I still feel stuck.

I’ve been told by doctors that I likely have depression and social anxiety, and more recently I was diagnosed with ADHD. I haven’t really done much to learn more about how it affects me — I guess because I’m not sure where to start. I’ve tried therapy, but it never really felt like it helped. One time I brought someone with me to a session and they said it was a waste of time. I think I agreed. I wasn’t getting the kind of support I needed.

I’ve been trying to make changes in my life, but I keep getting pulled back into the past — memories, relationships, childhood, trauma. I replay everything, wondering how things could’ve gone differently.

I’m not close with my family, except maybe my younger brother. My mum was the main source of my pain growing up. My stepdad was pretty much absent. Around them, I always have to wear a mask. I feel like I’m not a person — just something that’s expected to sit quietly and behave. Being alone with either of them feels unnatural and uncomfortable.

I keep falling into this cycle of Distance, Avoidance, Fear, guilt, or shame, Repeat.

It might sound dramatic, and I know other people have been through worse, but my life did feel chaotic.
	•	I didn’t have a father until I was 14.
	•	Raised by a single Filipina mother carrying generational trauma.
	•	Bullied at most schools, felt like an outsider most of my life.
	•	The one time I felt genuinely happy and free, it lasted only a year.

I fell in love at 14 — with my childhood best friend. That relationship brought me comfort, but then my parents forced me to change schools. The happiness I built crumbled. My parents were never emotionally safe. When they found out I was becoming intimate, they read my diary, my texts, took my phone, and cut me off. I had no job, no way out. Someone at school told me about Kids Helpline, and I used school computers to email them.

Then my mum invited me to “visit” the Philippines before the school term — I agreed, thinking I’d be safe. But after a phone call from the police on the final day, she decided to leave me there with her side of the family. I didn’t speak the language, didn’t know anyone, and wasn’t allowed online. I stayed for a year, not knowing when I’d return.

People told me it was just a free holiday, that I should’ve enjoyed it. But mentally, it was terrifying. When I came back to Australia, I felt completely numb — and everything only got harder from there.

I stayed too long in my first relationship. Got kicked out. Lived with grandparents. Made friends who weren’t good for me. Eventually got into an even worse relationship — manipulative, emotionally abusive, full of lies and gaslighting. I gave too many chances. I became suicidal. But eventually I left. And I survived.

Now I’m in a healthy relationship — the first one I’ve ever had and it scares me how emotionally distant I can be. I start wondering..am I losing my empathy? I don’t always know how to respond when someone’s hurt by something I’ve said. I freeze. I overthink everything. Even when I say sorry, it doesn’t feel like enough. I just… don’t know what people want from me sometimes.
It’s like my mind shuts down when I’m confronted, and I genuinely can’t think. I isolate, avoid people, and then feel even worse for doing it.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it trauma? ADHD? Both?",1753826042.0,2025-07-29 21:54:02+00:00,3,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcorix/i_feel_stuck_emotionally_no_matter_how_much_time/
1mcoq1c,My lack of success on dating apps leads to me watching too much porn.,"I've been using dating apps for a few years now and have not had a ton of luck. I have gotten a decent number of matches but most go nowhere. 

Whenever I talk with someone I am interested in I find myself getting very heavily invested in them before we have any real life connection with each other.

I don't think I'm doing anything that would make myself seem desperate on dates, I make myself presentable, I'm friendly and make it obvious I am interested in her. That being said I am ready to be in a relationship, and I'm tried of being single and playing the dating app game.

I've noticed that when a relationship ends, or a person I met on the apps tells me she's not feeling it, I turn towards porn hard.

I think I'm trying to fill this sense of loneliness and desire for intimacy with porn which I feel is very unhealthy.

I want to stop using the apps because I have become very jaded. I'm almost never actually interested in people I match with and go on dates with people just to do it which is obviously wasting both of our time.

I don't know what causes this, i want to take responsibility for it but it's like i lose control and will just over explain and explain and talk about what I'm feeling in the hopes that my friends can say the perfect thing to make it all go away but that's an impossible task. 

My mind plays tricks on me a lot, and i genuinely don't know what's real at any time, i don't know if my friends love and support me or if they hate me but are too nice to say anything. I will make up scenarios, misinterpret everything and then have a complete breakdown that lasts hours, and time goes so fast for me when this happens, everything is moving so quickly and before i know it 5 hours have passed and I'm still in a state

I don't know if I'm doing a great job explaining this because I've just come down from a very long breakdown, it's just scary, and I'm tired of losing friends. I don't want to make my breakdowns so visible to my friends, i want to be able to self soothe, it doesn't help that my closest friends live a good 6 hours away from me now and i can't drive yet so we can't see eachother in person without making plans first

I haven't lost these friends yet and I'm determined not to let it happen, they're not the problem, i am but how do i learn how to make these anxious thoughts of them hating me go away? i get into full on panic attacks over it and I've tried everything people usually recommend, I've done meditation, breathing exercises, the 5 senses method, cold showers, ice cubes, none of it works for me, or i get so paralysed in the position I'm in i physically can't get myself up from where i am to do hald of these things. I've tried to distract myself, watch my favourite shows, listen to my favourite music but i can't do it properly. I'm honestly feeling like it's a bit hopeless and I'm broken and going to be stuck like this forever but i figured i may as well see if anyone has anything new or can relate to me in any way

1mconm6,I am 13m and have tried improving but have been struggling,"Sorry for this post being vague and around the point i didnt feel very comfortable and it is also a vent.

So recently i have started to struggle more then ever and realise the things i have been doing to improve have bren making me do things worse and i have just kept on making me think that i need it in my life.

So around the later end of school i was more free from other people and I started to be more intrested in improving stuff like language and some other activities. this isnt the first time i have wanted to do stuff like this but i wont mention for now.

But things changed when it became summer its hard to describe the new feelings but i didnt feel a schedule like i did in school(and i also
put more expections for improvement meanwhile i felt like i had to have fun) and my way of dealing with this was feeling a day before this. I felt like i had to do this because of some other people and also because of the day before.i kept on eventually feeling bad but since summer made me more confident i still felt like i was fine because i also felt like that summer without these activties wouldnt be much better.

Then i went on hoilday and it is really compilcated but to put it simply after that i started thinking about school and the more i started realise that thing i did to keep all of this was not good(there is way more then i mentioned here although i dont feel comfortable talking about it)

With all the problems with it i am so confused whenever or not i should continue with school starting soon.

1mcol4q,Are you mentally ill if you hit your parents back?,"I don't think anyone would hurt their own parents even if they are abusive to their kids.I wouldn't call my parents bad but when I was young they used to hit me ( with belt,stick or whatever they get) to discipline me and I bear resentment towards them for this treatment.i used to tell them that it was wrong for them to treat me like that even if it was for something I did wrong.they won't ever agree but tell me that it was a necessary parenting way which they will use again on me even in my adulthood if I did something not right according to them.my mom especially believes I should be obedient always.Im an only child and there are times in my life where I used to feel extremely alone in my life in my own home where I cry myself to sleep where I had noone to simply talk or communicate my true thoughts( no friends and never will be.I was bullied at school.im content with alone existence.my family isn't that social which results in my behaviour in social settings to be a little awkward.iam kind of introverted so I don't mind that not being much social).my parents are conservative but educated ( just dad working outside) but their mindsets and thoughts on a lot of stuff are regressive and sometimes problematic which I have come to the conclusion that they will never realise themselves.There were times when I was a kid I was molested but I won't ever tell this to them since I kind of know how they are gonna respond anyway.so whenever we talk about anything it just leads to arguments and fights and me being very impulsive and volatile (I don't know why I'm being like this.) I cuss at them a lot.( it hurts them and me inturn too.) And also whenever my mom used to try to hit me I hit her back( we both have bruises).i have become so aggressive,so abusive even.In my country hitting kids isn't a big deal and can be seen as a way of disciplinary action.But parents and teachers are highly respected worshipped and treated as gods where everything they do or say is supposed to be the ultimate right thing which should be obeyed.(I know parents don't have any I'll intentions towards their kids) 
So when my mom told my relatives about me hitting her they never heard or even bat an eye at the part where I was hit as a child ( that part was selectively skipped by their mind.) and they said I should be treated.maybe they are right it's not normal to get violent towards anyone at all.Am I mental ok?

1mcnu4e,M29 Struggling with plagiocephaly and feeling lost,"Hello. My purpose with this post is not to ask for help with antidepressants or therapy, but something physical. I have plagiocephaly on the right side, just above the ear, right on the corner of the head, and also a dent in the center, on the back of my head. I’m 29 years old and I’ve been trying to survive with this somehow..

I don’t enjoy my life. I’ve never had a girlfriend or even a good friend. Not because I can’t, but because most of the time I just don’t want it. It’s weird because when I’m home, I feel like going out, being with people, doing something. But then when I’m finally around people, I always feel one step behind. I look at the way they talk to each other, how they laugh and have fun, and I just feel like I don’t belong to them. 

No one understands what it’s like to live with a weird-shaped head. It’s like I have two different heads: the left side is normal, peaceful, like I don’t feel anything, it's really like heaven, but the right side feels like there’s something inside, or like something is pushing. It gets worse when I’m cold, tired, anxious, or didn’t sleep well and I just hate this.

Sometimes it affects my concentration, but apart from that I’m “normal”. No one would guess I have this, because it’s covered by hair and not that noticeable.. But I feel it all the time, and I honestly can’t live like this anymore.

I often imagine myself dying, like different ways I could do it. I imagine the funeral, my mom crying and how tragic it would be, and even though I think she failed me a lot as a mothe, especially when I was born with this very noticeable head shape and throughout my life, I know she loves me and she did everything she could as a mom, and I love her in some way, so I don’t do it. That’s what has kept me here until now.

Right now I’m solo travelling. My grandmother is the one who made this trip possible for me. I’ve been travelling for one and a half months, but these last two weeks have been tough. I’ve felt no motivation to be around people, i’ve cried before sleeping, and after waking up, just thinking about how much pain it would cause if I killed myself. It’s not even about me anymore, it’s about them.

That’s actually the mistake I always make. I smile, I try to look normal, I pretend to care about socializing, but in reality I just want to be alone. I just want to isolate myself and play games, do nothing. Time goes by, I’m almost 30 now, and I feel like I didn’t live and didn’t accomplish anything. I just want it all to stop.

I never talked about this before. One of the reasons I’ve hidden everything is because I know my brother also has mental problems. Can you imagine being a parent and having not just one, but two kids with serious mental struggles?

What makes me sad is also that I’m somehow an attractive person. I like my body, I’m a tall guy, and just the idea that I could be a normal guy if I had been born with a normal shaped head makes me very emotional. It’s just a shame… It’s frustrating because I feel like I could have a good life, a girlfriend, be confident, just like any other person. But this one thing, something I didn’t choose, completely ruins how I see myself and my future.

I don’t know what to do. I just had to write this. If I ever manage to get out of this hole, I want to help other people with mental health problems. But right now, I don’t see a bright future.

1mcnr7h,Feeling tired and empty,"Hello,

I’m (25M) in a stable relationship, well paid job, got two degrees, but can’t help to stop feeling empty and meaningless inside. I feel like my life is all about chasing excitement (finishing undergraduate degree, finishing masters, getting a job, getting a better job, travelling with my partner, etc.) but the joy it brings me is very temporary. Every time I think “if only this works out, I’ll be the happiest person on Earth”, “all I need it is X and then I’ll be happy” but as soon as I reach X, I’m back to being “empty”.

The latest X was a new job. I’ve worked for 3 companies in the last 5 years and I have always found reasons why I needed to switch to a new job. But part of me feels like those reasons are excuses and I just want to fill the emptiness. For context, I have never had any difficulties at work, at any of the jobs, I am always a top performer, have received multiple promotions and pay rises at my current job, and I’m highly regarded among my colleagues. I just never feel like my work is meaningful or impactful, and I’m worried that the new job I’m starting next month won’t make me happy either and the issue is me and not jobs I’ve done before.

Last year, I have been seeing a therapist every two weeks. Some sessions were better than others, but I stopped seeing my therapist because I just didn’t feel like it was working. I have seen a lot of domestic abuse and alcoholism growing up. I don’t have a close relationship with anyone in my family. I’m also a gay man and I grew up in a conservative/toxic environment. No one in my family seems to have any issues with me or my partner and I moved to a different country where where no one has issues with gay people but I still don’t feel normal and I think part of me feels a need to prove my “normality” to others.

Not sure, what the goal of the post is. Just wanted to say these things out loud and see if there is anyone else in a similar boat and would like to share their story.

Sorry for mistakes, English is not my first language.

Thanks",1753823639.0,2025-07-29 21:13:59+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcnr7h/feeling_tired_and_empty/

Lately, my mental state has been rough — I can't sleep, I can't focus on work, I just feel lonely and depressed. Out of desperation, I downloaded a dating app and unexpectedly got a match.

I opened up to her about everything, and surprisingly, she's okay with meeting up and even having sex. At first, I thought it might help relieve some of the stress or emptiness I’ve been feeling… but now I feel guilty. Like I’m doing something wrong.

My parents didn’t raise me like this, and part of me feels like I'm using her, or using sex to fix something deeper. I don’t know if this is right. We’re supposed to meet tomorrow, but I’m torn.

1mcni0d,Why are we generalized,"Im sorry but no other communities take posts from someone with such low karma. This is impacting my mental and social health though. I’m 15 and I’ve noticed that men are consistently seen as pigs, and generalized under the label “dangerous.” And it’s always “men,” not specific people. The problem is always men in general. Men are rapists, men are evil, men ruined this world, all men should be approached with caution. And then there’s backlash when someone says “not all men,” when in reality, it truly is an issue. I’m sick of being grouped with the rapists and the murders. I don’t want to be seen as dangerous and evil. I just want to do my thing, to chill, to pursue my interests, but whenever I ask someone of the opposite gender something, they’re always suspicious. Why can’t we learn how to love and forget how to hate? Why can’t we just all be seen as people, and let our individual actions prove for or against our morality? I just don’t get it. There’s no way to win. When people talk about men’s rights like I am right now, people call us incels and sickos. Yet we are told to open up and talk about our issues. I don’t hate women, I want to stop getting called a misogynist, a term thrown around far too often. I truly don’t understand and there is no way to win. Any kind of pushback from men when others label them evil is deemed as redirecting, as being part of the problem or being a misogynist. It really sucks and no matter how much you talk about it, men expressing their emotions and feelings will always be seen as a threat.

1mcn9ce,I’m so confused and it’s stressing me out,"Hellooo. I have a short story: when I was nine or ten (I don’t really remember anything from that time), I was at a public pool with a few friends. I went on the slide, and when I plunged into the water, a man happened to be standing there (He definitely saw that I was on the slide because he had looked at me already) and he was standing right in my way, so I basically slid into him. As soon as I like, “crashed” into him, his hand went first to my butt, then waist and then butt again, before taking his hand off of me. He also said something like “oh I’m sorry, didn’t see you there” but he definitely did see me. I was incredibly uncomfortable and his hands were on me for weirdly long. After backward swimming/walking away from the slide, he was still staring at me and kind of smirking (?) at me. It was very uncomfortable but I don’t know if it was on purpose or if I’m just thinking that. I had forgotten about it until a few months later, so I don’t know if I’m just making myself believe that it was more dramatic than it was or something, or if it actually happened. 
I think about this a lot even though it’s already been four/five years. How do I figure out whether I’m lying to myself or if this actually happened like that? 
I think about this daily and I can’t tear my mind away. It’s making me nervous and I don’t wanna lie to myself. I know a lot of people’s  experiences are far more intense or frequent, I’m genuinely sorry if this isn’t the place to post this or if I just shouldn’t post this at all.

1mcmppo,My (22F) parents’ secret has shattered how I see love and family,"My parents (both 47) have been together since they were 14 — high school sweethearts who built a life together. My dad left the Philippines to move to the UK with my mum so they could raise us (my siblings are 12 and 18). My mum became a nurse and worked hard to give us a better life. For 28 years, she hadn’t experienced heartbreak. We seemed like the perfect family.

Yesterday, my mum told me a secret she kept for 5 years — my dad was unfaithful. He was chatting with another woman behind her back. She said she’s healed and can talk about it now, but it hit me like a storm. She stayed because she didn’t want us to grow up in a broken home. She said if we were older back then, she might have left.

Part of the reason we didn’t move back to the Philippines was because of me — I wanted to be a doctor, and they didn’t want to waste my potential. That makes me feel even more responsible for keeping the family together.

My dad was messaging the other woman and had plans to meet her. I saw messages where she said she wanted them to be serious and for her family to know him. My mum said bad influences from his old friends pushed him into it. He even planned to fly back to the Philippines in April 2020, but COVID happened, and she says that’s what saved our family. I told her he didn’t need to put himself in a position for an ultimatum.

I read messages between my parents about divorce and choosing between him or the kids. It was heartbreaking. My mum kept bringing it up back then, showing she hadn’t moved on. She said if they don’t move on, they’ll never be happy staying together.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and jealousy. I love my boyfriend and want a family with him, but I wonder if I’d do the same as my mum — stay despite betrayal. I stayed with an ex who cheated on me multiple times, so now I worry I’m more like my mum than I thought.

My mum says “all men are like that,” which makes me paranoid about my relationship, even though my boyfriend is good. She says my dad was good too — for 28 years he never did anything.

My mum asked me not to tell anyone — not friends or my boyfriend. I’m angry at my dad but want to keep this private. I just needed to say it somewhere.

I know some people have it worse, but this is my real life — the pain and responsibility I carry every day.

TL;DR:
My mum told me my dad was unfaithful 5 years ago. She stayed for us. It shattered my view of love and left me carrying this secret alone.",1753821228.0,2025-07-29 20:33:48+00:00,6,4,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcmppo/my_22f_parents_secret_has_shattered_how_i_see/

When I was in 6th grade (around 11 years old), I was standing in line behind a girl at school. At some point, either my coat or maybe even my hand might have touched her butt — I honestly don’t remember clearly. What I do know is that if there was any contact at all, it was completely unintentional. One of her friends said something like, “Can you stop touching [name]’s butt?” and I immediately replied, “I didn’t do it on purpose.” Now I’m 20, and this moment still sticks with me. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering what exactly happened, and feeling afraid that others might see it in a negative light. I didn’t have any bad intentions, but not remembering clearly makes it hard to move on. It’s been affecting my mental health more than I’d like to admit.

1mcmit2,My Poppa just had a TIA,"Background: my bio dad has lived a 12hr drive from me since I was 6 and I’ve been NC for the past decade. While they were separating, I stayed 2 days a week with my mom, 2 days with my bio dad, and 3 days a week with my grandparents. They literally helped raise me. My mom’s next husband was emotionally and physically abusive to me and only me because I wasn’t “his”, behind my mom’s back while she worked to support his ass and me and my three siblings. We lived with my grandparents on and off while my stepdad constantly got us evicted. My poppa was the only good male influence I had, and was basically my stand in father figure. He walked me down the aisle and we had a dance together at my wedding. Also for background, I have diagnosed anxiety (and depression, but not relevant here) and have been medicated for the last 1.5 years after having days long anxiety attacks. 

My poppa has been in and out of the hospital for the last month with ongoing infections that they couldn’t find the source of for the longest time. He’s been out of the hospital a little over a week, but had to go for daily IV injections. Two days ago, he lost vision in his left eye and went in for more testing. Turns out he had “massive disc hemorrhage” in both eyes and has macular degeneration, so that was investigated. Found out this morning that it was caused by a TIA (mini stroke) and is not reversible. He’s now permanently blind in his left eye and at risk for a full stroke. 

I’m so worried for him. My anxiety is going haywire today since hearing this news. I know he’s getting older (he is 86), but idk, his dad and his uncle both lived to be over 100 so I always just assumed he’d be around for years yet. I’m scared to lose him, and just so anxious about his health right now.

I was seeing a psychaitrist from nov 2023 to nov 2024 because I kept having anxiety attacks but that is completely gone now. My father got remarried in jan 2025 and I was so upset about this fact for no obvious reason (the way I found out was dramatic, I was the only one that knew at first but I don't think that justifies the intensity of my feelings) but I buried it inside and now it's suddenly stirred up again and it feels worse than when I first found out. My relationship with my mother is not stable, one time she shouts over every small thing, she'll stay like this for days or weeks, then suddenly we're joking and talking normally. She views my mistakes differently compared to my siblings' , she says I'm a burden and that I should find somewhere else to live but she also says she doesnt mean it later when it feels like it's the thing she wants most in this world, I get upset with her and then feel guilty for it when she talks to me kindly again. She thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to do everything she wants me to do (not as in university major or hangouts with friends, but as in how I speak to my father, what I say to him and the way I sometimes refuse to deliver some of her messages to him). My father treats me well but I can't help but act too formal and polite with him, I didn't grow up seeing him a lot and he is a good person until a problem comes up and suddenly he scares me to death and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.
I don't feel like I belong in this house, I don't belong in my father's too and I'm not comfortable in either. This feeling is killing me because I just feel like no matter how happy I am it doesn't feel like this is my place and I will always come back to this house even after an amazing day. I sleep at 5 am because the night is the only escape I get to have. 
What I'm doing rn is that I sit everyday with my feelings and thoughts when they're all asleep, it makes me cry a lot and I've been like this for many days that it's starting to exhaust me physically how I cry so much that I have headaches and dizziness. It feels like my energy is so low and that's not common for me. I've been learning Spanish as a third language for two years and I love history so much so I spend a lot of my time reading history books and watching videos about it, I recharge though self care too whenever I can. I have amazing friends that listen and comfort me the best they can but I just can't help this feeling and I'm so tired my chest feels like I'm carrying so much and I hate to wake up and find myself in this house again, I try to go out with friends, father or alone as much as I can but I just don't know anymore.

When i go out i get cat called quite a bit and i lowkey really like it even though i know its like all old guys with wifes and familys and stuff i love it when they pay attention to me and compliment me. I’ll wear more revealing clothes on purpose so that i get stared at by guys. And if i go out and im not stared at or car called or anything i feel upset and unwanted.
Ive never been popular at school, im not bullied or anything im just quiet. Ive never dated a guy cause i dont talk to lots of guys either but I still like crave that attention. Whats weird is that I like it from older guys, like if a guy my age did that to me id think it was gross but i like it when those guys do it. Obviously i wouldn’t actually talk to an old guy with a wife and family or whatever I just like the attention I think.

1mcm1nn,I Don't Know What To Do Anymore,"My wife suffers from bipolar disorder. Up until a few years ago I had never seen her have a manic episode. Now she's having them every few months (if not more).

We have kids (9 & 7) and the oldest has autism. I try and explain that mom is sick, but I don't know what actually gets through...

When she isn't manic she is literally the best person I know. But when she is manic...

My wife is medicated and sees a trauma therapist. She was seeing a regular therapist virtually for awhile, but I don't think it really did anything.

I also think I've identified at least one of her triggers. She had a hysterectomy a few years ago and a year or two ago she was lifting something at her old job and basically prolapsed her blatter or something terrible like that. Anyway she has basically been in a state of constant pain ever since. She was getting some injections for the pain but she is way overdue (2 or more months). She's been dealing with it in various other ways since (pain management appointments, trips to the ER) everything has been a bandaid (and not a very good one). Anyway...when she can basically no longer manage the pain, she starts having manic episodes...

And here we are on one again...it's not her fault...but I just can't deal with it anymore. She won't listen to me when I say she needs help. She does things with our kids that I think are dangerous (driving them multiple hours away on literally zero sleep).

1mcljus,ADHD or distraction?,"Hey everyone! I really need some help, especially from those who’ve already been to therapy or are going through it.

So here’s what’s been happening with me:

I get distracted very easily when I study. But strangely, when I play games or read non-academic books, I can get super focused , so focused that I completely lose track of time. I often end up doing my work right at the last minute before a deadline.

I speak fast, walk fast , yep my friends have pointed it out multiple times. I also get really restless whenever something feels too hard, like a tough project or task.

(again I thought these were my traits . I for some weird reason took walking fast as a compliment from childhood and kept it with me as a mannerism . Talking fast too made me look smarter from childhood , so thought of having that as well .)

To be honest, I’m not very disciplined or consistent shamelessly admitting that. But what’s weird is, when there’s pressure (like a deadline), I suddenly get hyper-productive and do the whole thing in one go.

I used to think this was normal. I mean, isn’t half the world procrastinating like this? Doesn’t everyone feel distracted or restless sometimes? I thought it is an issuedue to mobile phones etc . When did that become disease or I am not sure

But now I’m wondering if there’s more to it. I’ve been thinking about therapy, but I’m unsure. As a student, I’m not loaded with money. Each session costs are pretty high , and therapy usually takes multiple sessions, right? I’m just not sure if it’s worth spending that much , even though I know mental health is important.

Also, when do people actually need medication? How do you know when it’s really ADHD or just regular stuff? I’ve heard from some friends that therapists sometimes over-diagnose things like ADHD and stretch sessions for money. That honestly makes me a little scared and how do I know I’m not being taken advantage of?

And even if I do have ADHD or something similar, can’t I manage it on my own somehow? Is it really necessary to go through therapy and meds? I’ve got so many doubts in my head, and I just need some honest advice from people who’ve been through this or know someone who has.

It would mean a lot to me if someone could help guide me a bit through this.",1753818606.0,2025-07-29 19:50:06+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcljus/adhd_or_distraction/

1mcl007,I think I'm an Online Predator or just one in general,"For context, I'm a 16 yr old girl who always enjoyed playing on the platform Roblox with friends, family or just solely by myself. I never really had issues or thought of being an ""Online Predator"" until recently and it's been driving me insane. And here, I'll explain why. Most of the time I tend to play the game Berry Avenue on Roblox to dress up, make ocs or sometimes do rps but I've been feeling as though I'm going to do something sexual towards someone while I'm rping. For example, in a family rp where I'm the Mom, I'm afraid I'm going to say or do something sexual to the said user I'm playing with, which from what I can recall I haven't or I normally don't. And now, I've been wanting to have a Dad in the family rps for some reason, I think it's because I'm attracted to their avatar or just aroused or something & it's really weird..because I've never felt this way before. However, the times I have rped with a ""Dad"" in the fam rp I wouldn't do or say anything that is suggestive though I would have strong feelings/urges. I don't want to be a Child Online Predator, it literally scares me.. 

EDIT: I sometimes feel like I have acted on these urges or are going to, I'm also afraid I might go to jail..Not only that, when I'm in the game dressing up in the spawn area, sometimes people walk into me or bump into me once or more, than once and I just stand there almost for like attention or sexual gratification (Idk what's wrong with me).",1753817355.0,2025-07-29 19:29:15+00:00,4,6,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcl007/i_think_im_an_online_predator_or_just_one_in/

This country changed the studying system to where now eleventh grade and twelfth grade are shared grades go into your overall grade. Eleventh is thirty percent and twelfth is seventy percent. Now you also have to pick a general college field of study for example technology field  or health and medical field in which you are forced into specific material to study (for example biology and chemistry and advanced English as well as one material of your choice for health and medical field) so anyway, I don’t study. I am a smart kid, everyone tells me that. But I don’t study. I lied to my parents and didnt open a book the whole year and aced every exam by studying the night of the exam. So school exams came around in which it included the whole years material and I couldn’t study due to lack of time and no want to do i got hit hard and messed up bad. I’ve been studying for a month now and my first government exam from the starts after tomorrow. Im so scared and stressed. Lately I’ve also been getting dark thoughts. Shitty self esteem but no actual want to kill myself or hurt myself out of fear and being scared of going to hell for it. Im scared, i don’t want to study, I never did study genuinely throughout the whole year after seventh grade thanks to covid, and I am a lazy guy. I rely on corn everyday and hate myself for it. Every time I mess up I wish I was dead and never born, everytime im faced with something hard or tough I imagine myself ripping my own fingers off. I feel so lonely, my friends never text first.

Im so mad im so scared im socially anxious which doesn’t help either i hate how I look how unattractive i am, I feel like I’m unwanted even by my friends who I know are genuine guys and yet I feel like I shoehorn myself into everything.

Even a small one? Binge eat. I'll binge eat if my mind is making me feel bad too. My binges aren't as bad as they used to be, I used to binge to the point where I was in excruciating pain. I just hate my body so much. I cant stand the sight of it. I've never been able to be even content with my body. I hate everything about myself.

1mckcsn,Overcoming Ego,"I have a horrible, horrible habit of poorly reacting and blaming others for things I am responsible for. I want to move past it, or overcome it, but it feels like I am programmed to do so, until others point it out, then I see that they are right, and it really hurts me. 

It feels like my mind sees things certain ways, perhaps automatic sort of defenses, and when pointed out, my ""logic"" and thinking that got me to push off responsibility doesnt hold up. It's not like I'm coming up with crazy things, it just seems I instinctively and almost subconsciously find ways to shirk responsibility.

This is hurting my interpersonal relationships. I want to be better and not instinctively do this. It seems like I have to really untrained my brain, and think about what people are saying in the moment, and focus on the fact that messing up is ok, that I can hold myself responsible, and be held responsible, without trying to push the fault off onto others.

Sometimes it makes me wonder if I am a narcissist, sociopath, or the like. I just cant stop from having my ego bruised when I am being corrected on things (rightfully so) and this causes others pain, and while I want to improve this, it just keeps happening.

During my initial days, I used to feel that I am stuck in a loop where I am happy for 10 days and sad for 20 but it ended real quick and then I went on a work trip to Egypt with a friend of mine. The trip was for a good 40 days but I had to come back home in a week coz I started having major panic attacks and it was my first time. After coming home, I tried therapy but somehow it didn’t go well and I ended up moving above that trip without working out on my issues. 
Basically my escapism game was on point and after certain period, I entered into a state of numbness. Whenever anybody asked me “how am I doing?”, I had no answers. I wasn’t able to express myself like the way I used to. Things got worse when I started hating on the things I used to love, getting out of my bed became a problem, sleeping more than 11 hours and always being in the numb state. 
I decided to go to a 10 day vipassana course so that I can sit with myself and figure out what has been going on but the moment i entered into the centre, Egypt happened all over again. I started having panic attacks and this time i didn’t wait for my condition to get worse I asked them to let me go home. The moment i came home I had a word with another psychologist and booked an appointment. But I feel that I am stuck in this loop forever. It’s been so long that I have truly felt myself.

1mcjzdq,"Depression, anti depressants, transitioning into adulthood, and being unsociable","College starts next month. I feel I spent my childhood wasting away being depressed and ridden with anxiety. I feel good for nothing, I don’t know if I’m going into the right career path. I’m afraid of being miserable. I’m afraid of not being smart enough. I’m afraid I’m socially impaired. Ever since I was a small child I’ve been anxious. I wish I could say I had a care free and fun childhood. Sometimes I catch myself wishing I could go back but then I remind myself that back then I was full of troubles too. It makes me so sad, no child should ever live that way. After three or so months of slowly lowering my dosage, I’m finally off of anti depressants completely. My psychiatrist said she didn’t feel good about getting me off them in the first place but I told her I wanted to see if I was REALLY depressed or not. She respected my decision. I thought that if I fought through the withdrawal symptoms and got a grip I wouldn’t have to rely on them anymore. I feel unlovable and a little ashamed if I have to take a pill to function as a normal human being, and without it being a completely different person. Waking up to my body feeling scared and having no motivation to do anything is killing me. I feel so weak. My life really isn’t bad at all, it never has been. Yes my mom was angry growing up, I had no adult to guide me and comfort me, and I got bullied to the point of having suicidal thoughts in elementary school, but, everything is fine now. Why can’t I just get over it. Why can’t I be strong or at least normal like everyone else. Why am I mental??? Why am I socially anxious. Holy fucking shit I want to be okay I want to be happy. I wasn’t the best student in school, starting assignments was scary and eventually my grades would suffer. I passed high school at least. This summer I’ve been isolating. I lost my best friend of three years who really loved and cared for me because I sabotaged our friendship. And honestly I don’t care. Why is that? I’m so odd. I’m not the best at making and maintaining friendships. Here I am, recently graduated, with zero friends from high school. Whatever. It’s like I can only maintain friendships from a distance.

1mcjz9q,I somehow subconsciously make myself believe I have a mental illness I don't have until it actually manifests in me?,"The only thing I've been diagnosed with is ADHD, depression, and generalized anxiety and I've defenitly shown symptoms for these all my life (like the ADHD) or for long periods of time (depression) 

But for some reason, when I go in depth over other mental illnesses/disorders, my brain starts making me subconsciously believe I have them. I'm not saying I simply relate to it or that's it, no, I quite literally, over multiple days or just hours, start being completely convinced I have it. And then eventually, it actually starts manifesting or developing.

My two prominent cases of these are Borderline personality disorder and psychosis 

I'm interested in mental health as a whole and I am also writing a story where one of the main characters experiences psychosis. So obviously I search for a lot of details. 
But only a few hours into researching, my mind has made me convinced I have it. (Again, it's not a matter of it being relatable, most of what I saw was stuff I never experienced like most of the possible Delusions victims of psychosis might have.) Eventually, after weeks, I began doing things I've heard of other people doing from psychosis without me even realizing. 
When I saw someone say they believe every day ordinary things were ""signs"" from something deeper, I started somewhat interpreting it the same way. Another common one is believing close people are out to sabotage your life, and as you guessed, I started *half*-believing the same thing. Last example is believing that electronics are watching you, I would change my clothes away from any device screen. 

The thing is is that I don't fully beleive in the Delusions, I'm rooted in reality unlike actual people who suffer from psychosis. But I started developing the same behaviors so persistently and most importantly *subconsciously*. And slowly I can see myself actually developing the disorder or atleast some half baked version of it. I know psychosis doesn't happen simply. 

And about the borderline: I saw people talking about them splitting on this patterns, developing aggressive thoughts against others, crying over wanting love, rushing for adrenaline, etc etc. And within hours to days to weeks, I started acting those exact behaviors. 

And whenever I do this, it feels like it really *is* a part of me and that I've always been like this for all my life. That's why it's not simple to stop. 

Hell even when I see people understandably getting upset over the suffering from these disorders, I literally shed tears over feeling ""understood"" and that I also ""experienced"" these when I never did? 


I don't know what this is and why it happens and I'm so just so lost and confused and worried. I'm open to hearing any facts or interpretations or guesses.

1mcjlt9,How do you cope when you realize your dream will never come true?,"I had a dream, something I truly wanted. But as I’ve grown older and reality set in, I’ve come to terms with the fact that it’s no longer achievable. That realization hit hard.

How do you process that kind of rejection without spiraling into a mental health crisis? Without developing destructive habits or self-harm? I just want to feel like I did five months ago, more stable, more hopeful, calm, does not give a fuxk

This thought keeps looping in my head and I can’t seem to shake it. How do you convince yourself that not all wishes are meant to be fulfilled, and actually move on from it?

Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been through this and come out stronger. ",1753814216.0,2025-07-29 18:36:56+00:00,1,3,mentalhealth,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcjlt9/how_do_you_cope_when_you_realize_your_dream_will/
1mcjkl2,Idk what the fuck is going on in my life,"Ive just been through so much shit (to anyone interested - refer my post history). Theres no one in the world whom i can call ""mine"" and can share everything unfiltered. 
I have these cycles of extreme hope and energy and then a dip in energy followed by a dark suicidal cycle. Ive been going through this cycle for the past 2 3 months now. 
Sometimes I just want it to end it all by any means necessary. I dont even care anymore. I cant handle it. 
Im eating fucking 3 bags of chips, 2 sodas in a single day, bathe in the evenings, eat a sandwich at 12 in thr night- which basically the extreme opposite of how I was operating before. 
I just want to feel normal. No heavy feelings. No trauma. Just want it to stop. I want to be able to live again. Not just exist.

1mcj6cq,my doctor prescribed me antidepressants...,"i recently saw this doctor for an online consultation regarding my mental health. for context, im experiencing symptoms closely related to adhd (lack of focus, innattention, forgetfulness, and a lot more of all that stuff). that's what I've told them briefly. mind you, the consultation barely lasted for half an hour and all they asked me at the start was 'how are you feeling', no specific questions, no follow ups.

im the type of person who forgets stuff about myself unless asked directly, so i acknowledge that i wasnt able to give them a full picture of what i was going through. i promise i still tried to as much as i could at that moment tho. (i paid for that session, after all). and since they weren't asking questions, the session felt empty. (i don't usually see mental health specialists so i dont really know what to do or say TT). 

at one point in the conversation, they mentioned something that implied that i was having suicidal thoughts. they never asked, just assumed. (i corrected them of course, and said that i didnt have those kind of thoughts). they just said ""oh, that's good then"" and then proceeded to tell me they were going to give me medications and to observe how that would work out for me. their 'initial diagnosis' based on that short session was depression, anxiety, adhd, and somehow also a mood problem????. when i received the prescription, i looked it up and found out that they were antidepressants.

it just feels kinda off. am i just overthinking it? im worried that taking these kinds of meds (without really having the symptoms they were made for) would fuck me up more than it could help me. it was quetiapine and sertraline. 

anyway, im planning to get a second opinion sometime next month. ",1753813263.0,2025-07-29 18:21:03+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcj6cq/my_doctor_prescribed_me_antidepressants/
1mcj1k7,I spent a month listening to strangers in VR as a cat. It was life-changing.,"So... Times are mighty now, right? And everybody needs help, especially mental health-wise.

I gotta be honest, I got inspired by all of those popular ""strangers tell in VR"" videos so much I decided to open the VR lounge on a whim because a VR avatar felt safer than my own face. It ended... Well, I was shocked - it was hard but I do think many people would think different about life if they would've went through the same experience.

I do have an extensive background in psychology, but sadly English is not my native language. I had little to no practice with it at all, so I was extra shy due to accent. I decided to stay anonymous and deliberately let people know this was NOT a medical or therapeutic session. So for 30 nights, I logged in, spawned in the big room, got myself in a chair (both in VR and life, lol, it was comfortable), and waited. Sometimes no one would notice, and those who did were mostly kids who ran around making fun of me - no worries. Sometimes the portal would flash, and someone would wander in, mic crackling, and leave fast.

Night 3 - first and probably terrible encounter - a person with a furry avatar paced circles, voice shaking so hard I couldn’t tell if it was lag or panic. I just said ""hey, what's up?"" to him, and immediately got shy because of my terrible accent. Then he said three words - “I messed up” - then stared at the virtual floor for six real minutes. I counted the beats of silence, wondered if I should fill them, decided not to, and felt the room soften. Eventually, he exhaled a single sentence about losing custody. I didn't understand what he said at first! I didn’t fix anything, just listened. He left faster than I could say anything, so I felt like shit, really. I wanted to stop doing my little journey, but felt too bad for staying quiet, so I felt like it was my duty to keep going and help someone for real.

Same night, later, 2 am, I’m ready to log off, and a pastel wolf tumbles in screaming laughter...

Turns out she laughs when she’s terrified. Her partner had relapsed. Just.. what the hell man... it was so sudden too 😭😭😭

Our brain has weird defense mechanisms - laughter, memes, oversharing - and every one of them deserves patience, and in times of extreme anxiety these mechanisms can overlap - you've probably encountered crying when you are happy, and laughing when you feel like shit, right? There are researches about this subject, it's a very important idea in neural anatomy.

The laugh morphed into sobbing mid‑sentence, like someone changed the audio track without warning. I'm stopping here because it got very personal but I did listen to her and gave some advice. I hope I managed to help her.

What I learned - discovered that trying to match emotional tone is overrated, holding steady is better. Listening is underrated.

I'm tired writing this, maybe I'll drop out a part 2, if anyone is interested.

Things I’m keeping from now on:  
1 A bottle or cup of water beside the keyboard so I don’t forget I have a body, lol?  
2 A 2‑hour hard limit. Personal reasons + it was too hard for me  
3 The phrase “tell me what feels biggest right now” - I just heard about it somewhere - it opens doors quickly

Things I’m letting go:  
1 the idea that I need to be profound  
2 the urge to fill every silence  
3 the belief that I can’t help unless I have an answer ready

Thanks for reading.

1mciw0w,ADD and treatment resistant ANXIETY/DEPRESSION,"Hi! 

I'm new to this group but feel desperate to figure out what's going on. So in my twenties I was on low dose Adderall and thrived. A cup of coffee and 5-7 mg was great. I got the Masters and was thriving in my career. At 29. I had my son which was a traumatic delivery.  I wasn't able to go on medicine because I was highly sensitive to it after having him. Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. 

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel VERY low for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!! 

Thank you I'm advance for the positivity and encouraging thoughts!",1753812626.0,2025-07-29 18:10:26+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mciw0w/add_and_treatment_resistant_anxietydepression/

1mciq7k,Involved In A Car Crash. Developing Intense Anxiety/Stress Over It.,"I (18M) was involved in a car crash a little over two weeks ago and I wasn’t sure if I hit my head as I have no visible bruises, grazes, cuts or lumps and my head doesn’t really hurt. It all happened so quick as well so I’m just not 100% sure if I hit it or not. I went to the hospital and they discharged me after checking me and doing multiple neurological exams. They said it could possibly be a mild concussion and that it’d get better over time. The only symptoms I’ve had since the crash are mild headaches (don’t last long), dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue/drowsiness, hot/cold flashes and just a feeling of detachment. I just don’t feel like myself. It gets better when I go out and exercise and when I’m distracted by other things, but as soon as the thought of a serious head injury enters my brain again I start feeling worse. I’ve had really bad health anxiety in the past and I had gotten over it, but the crash has just triggered it again I think. I went to multiple hospitals - not just one. They all did neurological exams and said I have absolutely nothing to worry about, but still, I feel that something is wrong. I asked them for scans and they all said it was unnecessary because I was responding to the exams completely fine. Is this health anxiety or another anxiety/stress disorder? Is there something wrong with me?",1753812262.0,2025-07-29 18:04:22+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mciq7k/involved_in_a_car_crash_developing_intense/
1mcikfq,Advice for a Frustrated Teen?,"I hear many stories about how people don't get diagnosed with ADHD until their 30s or 40s, how so much of their life was wasted, or how females often go undiagnosed.

That terrifies me, especially with everyone saying to get medicated before college or you'll struggle and I'm already struggling academically now.

My parents don't believe in mental illness, I talked them into one consultation but it was pricey and they talked me out of going again. To be honest, I want to get diagnosed but I don't like the idea of therapy. I feel like I don't communicate my feelings well; even that one consultation didn't feel good.

I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I'm stuck in this middle ground where I obviously know I have a problem/executive dysfunction and it's affecting my relationships, schoolwork, and overall happiness.

For some context, these are some of the reasons why I think I may have ADHD and would love some input

* stare off into space unable to move or do a task even when i really want to
* VERY convinced my father has it
* no understanding of time (overestimate how long certain things will take me, run late the the last minute, etc.)
* Completely forget deadlines until they’ve already passed
* a million tabs open on my computer, this is a big one, I jump from one thought to another and never end up returning to my initial assignment
* I really am terrible in conversation, will forget what other people told me, never understand direct and simple instructions, forget to text first or reply back
* Maladaptive daydream 24/7
* A million absences from school trying to catch up on past due assignments
* split screen something under stimulating with a tv show or video instead of music
* really bad dopamine addiction; I will drop everything that I'm doing to do something that will make me feel even a little bit good. It's like a compulsion. This is my least favorite part about myself.",1753811926.0,2025-07-29 17:58:46+00:00,2,0,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcikfq/advice_for_a_frustrated_teen/
1mcih1z,I feel so lazy and useless,"Hello, so I’ve had chronic pain since I’ve been a teenager. Got diagnosed with fibro about three years ago. I’m on medication to manage pain and I work as tech support so my job isn’t physically demanding. At the start of the day I’ll tell myself I’m going to do this, this and this when I get home. But when I leave work I’m hurting and so drained I can barely function. It annoys me because then it only leaves me the weekend to do stuff I need to do. I figured with having a less demanding job I would have more energy but that just isn’t the case. I feel…. Inadiquate and lazy even though when I see others in the same position I’m in I tell them they’re doing great and need to care for themselves. I have no one who has chronic pain to talk to and I feel very alone and lazy. It’s messing with me mentally and I’m just so tired.

1mcicee,Struggling with reoccurring nightmares,"I have been dealing with the same genre of reoccurring nightmares for years. My psychiatrist and I have been trying different medications to manage it. 

Unfortunately I haven’t found the “fix”. My dreams are always the same theme, I’m moving, don’t have a lot of time, I’m rushing and can’t pick up/pack everything I want to take with me. There’s always a person/entity/problem that is pushing me to rush in my packing. 

I’m so tired of these dreams that they no longer make me super anxious like they used to, now they are a nuisance. I have them every night. No matter what I do or change and I’m so tired of them. 

Has anyone had any success working through these dreams? What has helped you?

In therapy, I know the way to go about it is to reframe my brain and find a solution while I’m in the dream to stop it. And sometimes that works. But most of the time I just end up arguing with people in the dreams about whether or not I’m actually dreaming. 

Without meds, the dreams are so realistic I have a hard time differentiating them from dream or real life. With meds, I can clearly label them as dreams.

1mchorm,The feeling of euphoric perfection. Has anyone had this,"
This is is bizarre feeling albeit a very good one that I have very seldomly and I don’t know how to quite describe it because it only happens a few times a year. That’s why I figured I’d start writing.

I haven’t discovered the source and perhaps I’m looking for it I’m not quite sure.

This time in my life a very positive change has happened. 

Now, in addition to that positive change everything seems like it’s going well I mean no matter what I do or see everything has it’s perfect place and I get this euphoric feeling. 

From looking at that perfect organization of an instagram explore page to the taste of a meal or the all the nuances of a song come together in perfect harmony. The internal feeling of even just hitting the space bar while writing and having control.

I can focus on any conversation and I’m not distracted. The visual of anything working in harmony say like the perfect rhythm of fitting multiple puzzle pieces together in their perfect place is very aesthetically pleasing.

Normally I am a very anxious/stressed/sometimes depressed person (I’m on meds)

It almost feels like an ocd person that has complete control. 

if everything was perfection flawlessly no matter what I do,say,see or hear. I feel no sense of urgency or anxiety like i normally do. I feel like an aura of joy around me.

Does that make sense ?

Is that joy ? lol I don’t know. But I love the feeling of it. Maybe my last bit of serotonin?

I’m 3 years sober of everything but it almost reminds me of the euphoric feeling after smoking weed.

Sometimes when I have feelings like this 
It reminds me of a Kurt Vonnegut quote about how we often don’t take time to embrace/recognize a good feeling when we have it.

1mchmav,Sudden phobia of men,"I'm a teenage girl. 
In the last 3 days I had an awful phobia of men. Even my closest friends I always felt really comfortable with, like being on the same bed level. EVERYONE, except my dad, make me feel terrible.
I used to be, compared to my close friends, not scared of men. And was even seeking for touch. Now I'm jumping when someone even accidentally touches me.
The problem is, I'm in a class full of guys (who feel too comfortable to share sometimes) with only 2 girls except me, daily for the next few days of month. From morning to Yesterday, I felt so sick, nauseous, dizziness, short of breath and twisting stomach (in a bad way).
In the first day I thought I coped, but in the evening I understood that I didn't ...
The morning after it began, a creepy old in the bus stop pat on the seat for me to sit next to him, luckily, my bus just arrived shortly after.
I think it's the first time, that at least I noticed, to be treated that way.

In the first class that day, it was awful, but barrable. Nauseous , tummy twisted May be surrounded by boys but only one boy sits to my side.
In the second class when I was really surrounded, behind me, next to my both sides and in front, and the teacher. I freaked out. I waited till recess and ran away from my guy friends.
I called my girl friend and started having a panick attack(my 2nd in life, but this was a whole new level!!!)
I had numbness in my hands, face, and neck, shortness of breath, I had a really hard time breathing, nausea, dizziness, and I felt like I was going to faint.
I couldn't get back for the 30 minutes recess and 40 minutes after, and was late for class. I got back close to the finish of class and sat away from everyone, when one of the girls is pretty close to me.

I am attracted to men, I was never really troubled/assaulted by their thoughts or pervert words/thoughts. I even found it funny.
Now I'm having an inner conflict - I'm attracted but so scared. All of the things that physically attract me in men now make me awfully scared. Feeling weak, like I can do nothing against their potential physically or mentally torment. 
I tried to meet up with my best friend (which was with me on the line during the panick attack) and two of my closet friends but returned home after less than an hour.
I think that today was a bit better but maybe because I was mostly with girls.

Ways I tried to cope with so far:
- breathing techniques 
- watching cute relationship videos (that even some of them frighten me)
- implant good thoughts and understanding that (at least the guys in my class) aren't going to hurt me.

I don't feel safe in this world anymore. I used to walk with my back upright.
I usually am always hungry, even in stress situations, but now I can only eat unsatisfying meals.
To clarify, I was not getting physically assaulted by anyone, just was exposed to some point of view...

I want to do something with it, but therapy is not an option. It also something I want to walk through with myself. 

Also this started right after being with people 24/7, like really 24/7 for a week.

1mchdh6,Trying to explain BPD to my mom,"Hello!

Less than six months ago, I (24F) was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. But I still struggle to understand this disorder myself, so it’s difficult for me to explain it to my loved ones. I especially want to talk about it with my mother. I started explaining it to her, but since I don’t fully understand it myself, she just felt like “everyone is a bit borderline” and that it was just a personality trait.

So I’d like to know if someone could help me put it into simple but meaningful words, especially to explain it to someone who doesn’t really know much about mental health, and who is older (but tolerant, even if she hasn’t always been). I don’t want her to dismiss it as something minor. I want her to understand that it’s a real disorder, not just me being “too sensitive” or “too emotional.”

What’s hard is that my fear of abandonment is more like a fear of neglect. So itdoesn’t come from my parents being absent. They were there, they gave me love.But I feel like the “issue” is that I didn’t receive a specific kind of love,compassionmaybe. I kind of learned that “feeling bad” was a way to get a little attention, a little love. It became a kind of emotional pattern: suffering = love. And it’s hard to unlearn

(I’ve also been through trauma and had a very guilt-based upbringing from my parents. So it wasn’t all perfect of course. Because of that, I developed anxiety disorders etc. and I’ve been in therapy for five years now.)

I’m French, I live in France (sorry if my English isn’t great btw), and I was diagnosed here. It might sound silly, but I don’t know if the criteria are the same everywhere.

Personally, I mostly feel the impact of my BPD in my romantic relationship. I don’t really know if it showed back when I lived with my parents, so I don’t know if it will make sense to them. But I want to try.

I don’t have friends either (yay /j), so my BPD really only shows up in my relationship.  
The biggest symptoms I struggle with are very intense, chaotic and enmeshed relationships, and this overwhelming fear of neglect or abandonment.

So if anyone has ideas on how to explain it in a simple way, without falling into the “everyone is like that” cliché, I’d really appreciate it.  
I’m not looking for something dramatic, just something that helps my mom get it

1mchcd4,How do you learn to make your own opinions when you were taught not to have any?,"I grew up in an environment where I had no space for my own thoughts, opinions or emotions. I always had to play the happy kid to make others happy and do what my parents said, including what to study and do with my life.

Now, I'n a follower. I've made massive progress throughout the years, but I still have this mindset ingrained in me and it's hard to get rid of it.

Just the other day, my boyfriend was asking me about where i'd like to go on holiday before having kids and I truly don't know. It never occured to me that I can choose these kinds of things. I have no opinion and hold no excitement for any particular holiday destinations and this goes for a lot of other things in my life as well.

I'm in therapy, currently doing trauma therapy for various things like this. But I was wondering how other people learn to make their own decisions and choose their own life and stuff. I don't want to just follow what my boyfriend chooses my whole life (and neither does he lol, I'm sure the decision fatigue is truly with him for this like of stuff)",1753809245.0,2025-07-29 17:14:05+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mchcd4/how_do_you_learn_to_make_your_own_opinions_when/
1mch23m,Have had anxiety attacks over how people view me in college,"I (22F) have gone through life only ever having the same group of friends since middle school and never really branched out.

I’m in college now and I still regularly talk to these people. However, I have not managed to have a set group of friends in college. Is this normal? Or do I just need to do better with how I put myself out there? It also didn’t help that the group of friends I did manage to have, I left behind because I decided to shift courses on a whim that I had to start from scratch all over again in a class where I barely knew anyone and everyone already knew each other.

I know it’s kind of embarrassing having so much anxiety at my big age of 22 but no matter how hard I tried to integrate myself with my fellow block mates nothing is sticking, and even then it also feels like they don’t want to speak with more than what’s polite. Maybe it’s because I was so used to already having a deep connection with others, that now that I’m placed in a foreign place with no friendly face in sight that it set me off? I really want to learn how to just be comfortable being alone or even handle that some people just don’t want to be friends with you.

It has brought me so much anxiety because I worry over how these people view me and if I’m well liked that it has ruined my sleep schedule and appetite…

It also didn’t help that the people I do manage to try and have a conversation with are all  in relationships so of course I’m not gonna be someone they’d want to hang out with to third wheel since they’d want to spend time with their partner. And I can’t relate to their topics since it almost always centers around the guy/girl they’re dating.This just makes me feel even more insecure that at my age of 22 I still haven’t gotten a boyfriend when the rest of my peers have been in the dating scene for so long.

I guess everything is just weighing down on me that I have no support system here, the envy of a relationship and yearning for a connection with someone that can help me cope with how life has been treating me lately…",1753808636.0,2025-07-29 17:03:56+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mch23m/have_had_anxiety_attacks_over_how_people_view_me/

the thing that really gets me is that i SHOULD be happy, right? i'm good at the job, i get recognition, the pay is decent. but instead i feel like i'm slowly dying inside. like i'm using muscles that aren't mine, if that makes any sense. has anyone else figured out how to tell the difference between regular burnout and just being fundamentally wrong for the type of role you're in? because i honestly can't tell anymore. am i just being dramatic or is this my brain trying to tell me something important? like how do you know if you need a vacation or if you need to completely rethink what you're doing with your life?",1753808524.0,2025-07-29 17:02:04+00:00,47,7,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mch05c/how_do_you_know_when_your_job_is_messing_with/

1mcfbjt,How do I apologize to people I haven't spoken to in weeks?,"I went on vacation in early June, and only just got back. During that time, I didn't speak to anybody I knew back home. Friends tried reaching out, and I never replied to them. I was supposed to, and I was going to, but I do this every time. Every time I don't have to see somebody in person, I end up falling off the radar. 

I don't know why I'm like this, but I want to change—I’m trying to learn, but I need to be steered in the right direction. I know I’m a shitty friend to do that to people, but I want to be able to apologize. While I don't think my friends would cut me off for this, I still believe that they are owed an apology and somewhat of an explanation. I often struggle with tone over messages, and I would really appreciate some help in figuring how to apologize and explain things a bit without coming across as if I'm giving excuses. 

For reference, I have chronic depression. Something happened during this trip that made me fall into a really bad ‘episode/slump’ (or whatever the proper terminology is). My point is, it got so bad that I wouldn't get out of bed, get dressed, shower, brush my teeth, brush my hair, eat, drink, etc. I was a mess, and I still am, but I'm trying to get into better habits. 

My two friends are good people, but they haven't really experienced this same level of depression, and I'm worried that it’ll seem like I just didn't care about them enough to reach out. I don't know what to do. This has been eating at me for so long.

Although when I said it, she was very surprised and said you took a week off work?  She then implied that I would be fired if that happened, and I could tell she began to regret even hiring me. After I said that, things were weird, and I could feel the staring at me for the rest of the shift.

1mcezsq,She faked a r*pe to mess with my head—and I still tried to love her,"I’ve been thinking a lot, and she was right to end things. With space, I’ve started remembering the things I buried or downplayed—because I didn’t want to lose her.

We had good moments. Real ones. I laughed with her, felt close, imagined a future. I know I wasn’t perfect—I shut down sometimes, and I didn’t always make her feel secure. That’s on me. I own it.

But I was never cruel.

She knew I was struggling financially, and told me other guys were offering to fly her out. When her friend said she should’ve dumped me when my card declined at McDonald’s, she smiled. That moment never really left me.

One night after a 14-hour day at work, she told me a weird coworker had been creeping her out. I said I’d come check on her. She told me not to. She was upset i didn’t text her back for abkut 45min after saying she was okay and had coworkers with her. Other guys know I am friends with and wouldn’t let anything happen.I showed up anyway. And as I walked into the building, she texted me that he r@ped her. That should’ve been my wake up call to leave there.

It wasn’t true. It was said to shock me. To get a reaction. To mess with my head.

She used my trauma and insecurities against me during fights, then acted confused when I started shutting down. I didn’t stop loving her—I just started protecting myself.

She once told me she was going to call guys she used to sleep with just to mess with my head. That’s when I realized this wasn’t love. It was control.

Looking back, I gave everything I could to something that slowly crushed me. So yeah, we weren’t compatible. Not because I wasn’t enough—but because I kept breaking trying to hold it together.

1mcelxd,Tired of battling myself,"I am tired of battling my inner self. I feel like I have been at war for so long that I don't remember what normal feels like, or what it is to actually feel alive.

For starters I get treated poorly by mostly everyone. This ranges from family like my parents, to my siblings, friends, etc. I deal with it but it gets tiring that I go above and beyond for all these people like donating time to help with projects, sacrificing things I typically do to be there to take care of their things they need and I just get destroyed constantly,.I take care of all these people and none of them do a damn thing for me. Once they get what they need they go back to attacking me on whatever they want.  
  
 No one respects my boundaries. I never set them so frankly that's my fault but I have tried to establish them and now it's me being considered ""mean, hateful, selfish, etc). It's soul crushing that I cant say No and Im forced to do whatever people want and I fucking hate it. I want everyone to be happy as I know what its like to be constantly sad but honestly im sad and no one sees it.

I struggle significantly Body dysmorphic disorder. I use to be morbidly obese at 300+ pounds and now weighing in around 150-160 its a different life trying to find happiness in a body you hate. I look at myself and I still see the fat guy. I have loose skin from losing all that weight and I hate it. Going clothes shopping is torture as I don't like the way things fit on me and I just hate this body. It's hard when you lose all this weight and you workout and know your calories and friends, family, and others make comments like ""you'll get fat again!"" and ""you look so sick."" Why cant you just be fucking happy I beat obesity. I struggle with eating and im scared to eat sometimes, Its gotten bad, 

Lastly Im tired of being told ""you don't own anything you ever do wrong."" I do own everything I do, and even things I don't.  Its so soul crushing when I have fought wars with friends, or family drama and when I go to help I get taken out and I will admit the faults I did, or I apologize for not being stronger in the sense of defending,. I have fucked up many times, as a friend especially and what angers me is that I owned it every time, Every time, Yet those people never own the things they did to me. They just push it away and never care. I am the one who deals with it, not them and thats so incredibly soul crushing,   


I try to talk about the things I did wrong and no one ever wants to talk or I get told ""it's life, it's ok. You apologized"" and then we are back here. However when I want to talk about how they destroyed or wrongs me I get told ""it's over, I said sorry, move on. No matter how much you try to explain a situation, show proof, I am, and will forever be the villain in the story.  
  
 While I am not perfect I always go above and beyond for the people I love and care about. I'll randomly buy you your favorite drink, your favorite meal, or get you something that makes me think of you and as a reminder that you are loved and valued. 

I'm so tired of feeling like this. I hate the constant back and forth in my head, I hate being alone in this battle and its lonely when its you locked in your own head with yourself. I  sometimes wish I could fall asleep and never wake up, or if I was driving that someone would slam into me at 75mph to stop it. I just sometimes wish it would stop for a few minutes. I deserve to be treated fairly and to be loved. It's so cold,.

please don't judge me for this, i get anxious super easily so if you have something mean to say id rather you keep it to yourself ☹️. this could be normal or something but I'm just going to ask here anyway to be safe! 

recently, I've been going down a rough patch with my mental health. my boyfriend (online) encourages me to vent to him and -even if i don't usually enjoy venting- i have to admit it's better than dealing with it on my own. 

however, ive realized whenever i talk about s/h or contemplating doing it he seems to get really worried for me and tries to stop. and how it does make me stop myself and recollect my thoughts, in this state of despair, i really enjoy the feeling of him desperately trying to stop me without any knowledge of if i will stop or not. i find myself dragging it on longer than it needs to and smiling and laughing at the messages of him trying to stop me even if i don't find it funny? it's really confusing, i don't know if it's me coping but i can't help but be amused. it kind of scares me.

don't get me wrong, i **love** my boyfriend so much and would never ever want him to be sad which makes me even more confused in myself. i usually am very dependent on other peoples emotions and am a really sensitive person (if someone's disappointed in me, asks me a question i don't know the answer to me ect i tend to just break down crying without reasoning) but this is an extreme exception for me. 

before anyone asks if its underlying trauma from my childhood, id like to say i got all the attention and love i need as a child from my mother (my father was ill) and I've never noticed anything like this before.

1mce5t1,Best ways to cut off toxic parents and ways to cope with it,"Soon my boyfriend (18m) and I (18m) will be moving out to a bigger city for college. Money isn't an issue for now, because my parents will cover for us until we become independent, but we dont know what to do about his family. 

They are very abusive and controlling. Even though the physical abuse is terrible, nothing can compare to the lenghts they go to to maintain control. For example a while back they were sending people to follow him everywhere he went (they arent rich, quite the contrary, so it was just shady men following him around our town).

We figured moving out might be the best opportunity we have to cut them off, but we don't know how to do that. The most reasonable way would be to slowly loose contact with them, but that's not an option. With these people it's either 0 or a 100. If they even know the address of our new place they WILL go there or send someone there as they have done before. I'm pretty sure there isn't a way to do it peacefully. 

In order to do so they would have to be informed about EVERYTHING (they asked him about all that multiple times when the topic came up), so as I said, it's not an option. Lying isn't an option either because they jokingly said they'll come visit when they get the chance and they have no idea who I am, because I'm not one of his ""approved"" friends. (they stalk every one of them)

I'm so stubborn on the idea of cutting them off, because I see what their presence does to him. I don't think there's a way for him to heal any further if his mother watches his every move. I hope at least some of you will understand, my parents and none of the adults I talked to can't seem to grasp the fact that his parents ARE in fact that bad. I'm also worried about him getting worse after the moving, I heard that sort of thing can happen. If you have any advice with any of this, please tell me.

1mcdf5q,She was my psychologist..then she left......,"
This might not be a question, but it’s something I’ve been carrying for a long time...and I finally need to let it out. I’ve also posted this elsewhere, hoping somehow it reaches the right place, or maybe just eases the weight I feel.

There was a psychologist at ICP Karachi, She probably doesn't even know what she did for me but she changed my life.

I was struggling with drug abuse and the burden of my sexual traumaand gender crises .... I came to her feeling completely broken. I didn’t think anyone could ever really ..see...me or make sense of the mess I felt inside. But she did.

She made me feel seen and heard She didn’t just “treat” me.. i think she was training in substance induced mental health wala part or so...
she genuinely cared. I remember sitting in her room thinking the world was ending. I was deeply alone. But she sat with me in that darkness. Not once did she judge me. Not once did she make me feel less than human.

Phir aik din wo chali gayin. She just disappeared. Disengaged, quietly. And I couldn’t find her again for so long..Therapy stopped without closure. Woh do lafz jo unhon ne mujhe kehay, main kabhi nahi bhool sakta:
""Tumhari identity tumhari streghnt hai, tumhare maslay nahi.”
Your identity is shaped by your strengths, not your wounds.

And honestly, maybe she’ll never see this. But I want to say:
Wherever you are, thank you.
You probably saved my life. Agar aap na hotin… mujhe nahi pata main aaj kis halat mein hota.

1mcdcyi,Whats wrong with me?,"Hello! I(32 F) have struggled with my mental health since I was in my early 20s. I have a really difficult problem with waking up on time and also doing my work. I have a good job at a very good company and its been my dream job but I just cant get myself to show up in the Office, wake up on time and actually do my job in a good way, always last minute and just enough. Or I do really well on some projects but then really bad on others. I have been there for 6 years and my boss has finally said that if i dont improve they will need to let me go. I dont understand whats wrong with me. I so badly want to be good at this job and just function like everyone else but it feels impossible? How do people do it? I have tried therapy, different anti-depressants and read countless of books in motivation and self-help but nothing changes. Currently I am trying Effexor and this is my last hope otherwise i feel like I should just give up and accept I wont have a career. These patterns have followed me since I was in my 20s and I have gotten fired from almost every job I have had. I feel so hopeless, like I so badly want to work but my brain wont let me? Does that make sense? 
Im getting checked for ADHD and autism as well but I dont really feel like the symptoms match except low motivation. Could it be something else? Am I just lazy? I honestly dont know anymore. 

Would really appreciate you guys sharing your experiences or if you have any good solutions?

1mccv5a,It is normal to feel like this? Do I need to reach out?,"To preface, I've already spoken with my doctor about anxiety and depression, for which I was given resources and a temporary group on Mindfulness, which gave me some coping mechanisms, but the effectiveness for me seems to have plateaued. 

For the past 2 years or so, especially ramping up over the past year, I've felt it incredibly difficult to feel anything. Most of the time.

I feel so disconnected from myself. I struggle to take care of my needs. I feel a complete apathy to my own wellbeing, I think at least partially because I find it hard to remind myself that I'm a person at all.

Everyone around me looks so vibrant. I feel lucid as an observer, but I find myself physically forgetting that I'm a person too. 

My own name feels hollow. I find it practically impossible to imagine my future self. My memories of my past feel like I'm remembering a different person.

I have no will or drive to do things any more. I can't focus even on video games, movies, reading. The joy and passion that I used to have just feels absent.

Externally I do my best to stay optimistic, helpful, and seem functional. But I feel like it's nothing more than an act. A coping mechanism to keep myself alive.

Especially with the way the world is going, trans rights taking blows, freedom of information restricting. It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller. Like the world itself is starting to choke at my neck, and I can't breathe any more. 



I know burnout and at least some levels of depression are ""common"" especially with younger generations. But I'm really fighting with the idea of maybe reaching out to try and get some help. But I'm not sure how much of this is in my head, and how much might require actual help.

1mccr0p,"i thought the police were after me, what could this be??","soo on my street recently there was a drug bust (well that's what me and my friends, admittedly mainly my friends, think it was)
and for some reason, i thought the police were after me specifically.

For context, there was a raid on my street. SWAT teams, dogs, and like 20 police cars.

the whole time the police were there, i watched, because something in my mind genuinely convinced me i was in trouble and going to be targeted.

the whole time i was rambling to my friends about being taken away or spoken to and things along those lines, i have 2 videos of my panicking and freaking the fuck out, and even getting ready to cry out of genuine fear that i was being targeted.

it (the raid) started at about 9pm maybe? and ended at about 12 am. i know this because - i was watching. i was making sure the police were not ""onto"" me (just to clarify, they have no reason to be onto me. i have done nothing illegal nor do i plan to do anything illegal, i'm only 16 i don't do much)

i slept on call with a friend because i was so shaken up.

genuine question, is this normal? do many people feel the same when witnessing things like this?

yes, i've had these sorts of feelings before. i've even avoided going outside, taped my windows shut, and taped the camera part of my devices before out of pure fear (back and front camera)
and yes these feelings end at some point, sometimes after a few hours or few days.

idk if this matters really but bipolar runs in my family, and my mum & nan often over worry about things, though i don't know if it's to the same extent as i do, as my mum was paying no mind to the police at all and telling ME to stop obsessing over it

[first time posting in this subreddit lmk if i've done anything wrong, just want to see a few peoples inputs on this because no matter what i did i could not calm myself down. Nobody could convince me the police weren't after ME, not even MYSELF. i'm so dumbfounded]",1753798878.0,2025-07-29 14:21:18+00:00,2,4,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mccr0p/i_thought_the_police_were_after_me_what_could/
1mccja5,I(35M) am not sure how to navigate my partners(38F) trauma,"We’ve been seeing each other for a year and decided to make it official in March this year. We’ve talked about marriage and moving in together. However…

My partner tragically lost her father in puberty, and developed trauma. The closer we bond, the deeper she pushes me away to avoid losing someone she loves.

She’s aware of her trauma and actively doing therapy.

I try to be as patient as possible and give her a sense of safety the best way I can. Nonetheless, I struggle to understand how to navigate this. The deeper our love, the closer I get, the more fear gets activated and she pushes me back.

She’s a smart and loving woman. Never mean, not manipulative, not testing me, very loyal. I’m aware it will be a ride and I’m in for it. I am also aware it’s her job to heal her trauma, but is there anything I can do? All that comes natural when loving someone seems to have the opposite effect of what we desire.

Any feedback welcome.

1mccdbi,Will meds help with my anger?,"So, I’d been on sertraline for some time before I stopped taking it, because I’m bad at taking meds consistently these days. I’d really say I don’t need it other than my bursts of anger.

It’s unusual, but being spoken down to constantly at work, not being able to do certain tasks, etc, leaves me so angry I’m often hitting my desk, myself, I’ve ripped notebooks apart and broken headsets at work without even realising because I’m pulling something too hard. I kept an old broken desk chair now that I’ve replaced it because I knew it would be better than hitting things, but got a bit of a shock when it bent the object I was using to hit because must’ve been going too hard.

I hate it. I’m so overwhelmed by it that I physically can’t hold it in and end up physically hurting myself or damaging things around me, but I’ve never had this problem before, and I don’t know if taking my meds (Zoloft) is actually going to help any or just put me through the awful side effects of starting again for no reason.

1mcc6h0,Tired of people telling me it's temporary,"I have been so depressed my entire life. Not a day I remember since age 5 where I didn't think of the end. And I have tried every single day to find reasons to keep going so I don't hurt others. I constantly remind myself to try something else, one more day, one more try. But I'm so sick of my depression being framed in terms of how other people might feel. If those people might feel so strongly why then do they not help while I'm still here? Is my pain only important as it relates to others who aren't depressed? 

And I'm so absolutely tired of being told that my depression is temporary. I'm med resistant apparently, most medications I've been on have never had the intended effect. I've been in and out of therapy and psychiatry with more negative impact on my life than positive. And still I try. I was even sent a book where a psychologist writes over and over that most depression ends in a few months or with treatment (the book is good and he's right about a lot of things with regard to other people but the more I read, the more I get the impression that it wasn't written for me). I'm 36 years old, not a full length of life maybe but 31 years of days taken up by wishing to be done is too much. I never asked to exist. Life has been too painful for too long. When my therapist goes home at the end of the day and enjoys time with her family, I'm still alone at home every hour of every day until I see her next, scraping the walls of my skull looking for any motivation to keep going, and coming up short. 

What's the god damn point? I've never had dreams or life goals that mattered long term. When asked I usually just create a 'goal' based on the moment. It never holds. Treatment continues to provide empty promises. Continuing to try, no matter what or how hard, has only prolonged things at best and created even more problems at worst. 

If you're reading this and comparing me to yourself I hope you'll take more cues from someone who's benefited from treatment than from me. I'm not even a good example when I'm doing everything I can. The only future in life that seems likely for me is that I live miserable for the rest of my natural days and frankly, I have little interest in that.

1mcbxfk,I haven’t left my house in months… how do you rebuild a life when your body reacts like this?,"Sorry for the long post and vocab. I find it hard to communicate.
 
I(26M) have been an ambitious kid since forever. I want to be a filmmaker. Not only that, but i want to have enough wealth that i am able to travel all over the world with my family without any sacrifice, like traveling business class, experiencing the best of the best hotels, food, etc. But with that I'm unwilling to travel. Even the thought of going somewhere gives me severe anxiety that is very unbearable. Even going local my body goes so tense that when i reach back home, body releases relief farts. And when i travel espacially in a car, i have groggy stomach. These feelings have been there since i can't even remember. Initially i wanted to travel the world, become a travel host for some show in fox travels etc. But i don't know how and when i got like these. In contrast to that my parents are very quick on their toes when it comes to traveling. They would be ready for any frequent plans tho my mother doesn't like frequent local outing. Whenever they make any plan i always refuse for which they make fun of me. Sometimes them making plans make me very angry and an uncontrollable anger comes out of nowhere demotivating them. As you know filmmakers require a lot of travelling but since i can't do any, it also makes me anxious for the future. In the past i went to delhi(tier 1 city) for a year leaving my hometown chandigarh(tier 2 city) to pursue my career, but i had to drop everything and come back. Not only psychological but also physical health wise i was incompetent for which i has to face the repercussions in the form of various health problems and deficiencies. But even that time was not able to change me and fix my fear of going out. I used to be very home sick and suffer a lot.
It's been 3 months since i got back from delhi but since then I've hardly left my house 3-4 times, that too for my dental appointment. I suffer from general anxiety 24/7 but this travel anxiety is extreme for me to handle. In addition to that, tho this is just assumption that it might connect. I feel a similar or less like of anxiety when someone, even the regular house help comes at home or people surrounding me in general. The more unfriendly faces i see the more closeted i feel. My behavior changes and i can't wait for everybody to leave or when i am outside the anxiety i feel is significantly reduces when i sit back in my car and is fixed with that relax fart when i reach home. What do you think I can do to fix this?

1mcbule,Pulling back,"I blocked this woman on here that I have been messaging with. Our connection is electric- flirty, interesting, with common hobbies, teasing. She is so intelligent and insightful and funny. She feels it too. At least from what she says. But she has also made it clear she has her own issues to work through and cannot offer much more connection than messages here.  At least for now.

I felt I started to be overwhelming. Messaging her more than she was responding. Being more flirtatious, more complimentary, more romantic with my words. I was composing french poetry. I don’t know how to do either portions of that phrase. It had to be mania. I got worried I would scare her off. So I decided to shield her with this block.

This behavior has to be a mania. I am right now unable to afford or get my meds. No money, no car. I can't see a therapist/psychologist for the same reasons. Due to a previous psychotic episode I just wrapped up some legal issues. It went well. Thankfully. I am struggling with work politics. I have so few irl friends. My ex-husband just moved out. I am having tension with my mother at the same time my father is struggling healthwise. I just realized I was gay in February after a lifetime of intense internalized homophobia. It is a lot so it would make sense I am out of control.

Before I blocked her I sent her a message and left it for about 12 hours. I hope she saw it. I just separated from a codependent marriage of 8 years. To man. Again, I just realized I was gay in February.

When I lay it all out like this, there are so many factors going against me. Against the possibility of pursuing this woman. What I have told and more. I just. My chest hurts with the thought of lossing forever the possibility of having found my person.

I wish I was healthier so I could move forward with my life. So that I could be more present for her. Give her the support and make space for her. She has struggles as well. I would be there for her. But my own issues swirl around me, and I don’t want to throw them on her.

1mcbt9k,Struggling to keep up with daily life,"Hi all, I am a 24F currently working part time and in school full time. My partner 24M is very supportive and we’ve been together for a long time, so they have seen me at my worst and my best. I have been on medication for over 2 1/2 years and the current combo I have for a year. Over the last few months I noticed myself falling deeper into my depression and specifically, anxiety. I have accommodations at my school, so I get some flexibility with my coursework and I’ve been able to keep up with that. However, I am so anxious all the time. I am anxious to go to class, I am anxious about work, I have barely been able to manage going to the grocery store. I take my medications regularly, and on time, but I can’t seem to get past this skin crawling feeling I have all the time. If I don’t feel anxious, I am foggy. Things slip past me and I lose hours of time just curled in a ball on my bed. I’ve neglected my regular hygiene and I just feel so out of my body.

Over the last week, I haven’t been able to sleep, I eat when I feel anxious, and I can’t keep up with my work tasks. At work, I fell behind a few weeks ago and had a meeting with my supervisor. I was able to catch back up, but just recently I missed an important appointment with a client who was already understanding enough to reschedule with me. I had not gotten back to them until today, to which I found out they went to my supervisor about it. I feel ashamed in myself because I had made so much progress in the last two years. I know I am going to be asked what happened, and having to explain my mental health episode just has me on a spiral. I am ashamed to tell my partner I messed up. 

I know I can’t jump to the conclusion that I will be fired, but I already feel so anxious about it since we have already had a discussion about my organization and time management. I have set up an apology and resignation email in case because I don’t think I can handle it. I am just struggling so much more than I wanted to recognize. I need some sort of job to support myself until I finish my degree this spring. I don’t know how to move forward. I feel nauseous all the time and I’m unsure what to do because my medications aren’t working anymore. I just don’t understand how I can make progress and then it’s gone in a span of a few weeks.

1mcb8oo,Mom makes me go to a Chiropractor for OCD treatment,"I (17M) was diagnosed with OCD About a year and a half ago, as well as an eating disorder. Originally, I had a phycologist that helped walk me through my eating disorder, but she moved out of state about a year ago. Her treatment didn’t really work for me either, as she focused more on body positivity rather that the rituals and OCD-related thoughts I had (and still have) around eating. After her departure, I told my mother that I would rather see an OCD specialist due to their care being much more tailored towards my broader OCD symptoms outside of just food. We went to see a potential fit in December, but was told by him that my weight was too low to safely begin EMDR therapy. Since December, I have made it my mission to gain weight and have put on 25 pounds, giving me a healthy body weight for the first time in years. In between me gaining this weight and being barred from treatment, my mother (bless her heart) has found… alternative treatment options. Originally, we tried “neurofeedback” which did absolutely nothing to help me whatsoever, but was at least doable from home. After this failure, she went down an alternative medicine rabbit hole and became set on chiropractic care to cure my ailments. She makes us drive 45 minutes away from home to go to this “elite pediatric chiropractor” who adjusts mostly babies and toddlers (which I find upsetting because they are so young). I’ve been making her happy by going for about 4 months now, but have seen literally zero improvement in my condition (as I expected). The chiropractor keeps saying stuff like “oh it takes time” and “keep coming and you’ll see results” but I believe he’s just trying to keep customers coming back. I would love to try real OCD therapy again now that my weight his up, but would no longer like to go to the chiropractor. The issue is, my mom is dead set on me continuing treatment there despite there being literally no evidence of my condition improving. Is there any way I can let my mother down slowly and explain to her in a calm manner that chiropractic care is snake oil? Thank you so much!

But when I have relationship (and I almost always having one) and if I feel any minor discomfort in my body or in my mind, it’s about the relationship or correlates with that.

1-do I really don’t have any problems other then relationships? (Its not realistic and sounds not possible) 

2-if I have any other problems, why im not seeing them and making a mask with having a relationship?

1mcan7w,Feeling Trapped and Controlled by Father Despite Some Financial Independence - Need Advice (F22),"

Hello Reddit, I'm a 22F, working part-time, and feel utterly trapped by my father's constant manipulative behavior. My brain hurts from the stress.

Here's what's going on:

Recently, old family friends (like extended family to me since childhood, bought me gifts, went on vacations) visited. I'd planned to rent an Airbnb and go to their village alone, but my friends gave excuses. The family friends then offered to take me for a few days, and I excitedly accepted.

However, after they left, my father exploded. He made a huge drama about money, how much it would cost him, and my ""arranging things without consulting him."" I'm not a child to ask for his permission; I've planned my trips through Europe without asking him. I just told him I'm going, he doesn't have the right to meddle in my business.

This is a recurring nightmare because:

I'm financially independent: I have significant savings from my part-time job. Money isn't an issue for me.

I cover most of my own education and activities:

Year 1: I paid 3/4, he had minimal participation.

Year 2: I paid 100%.

Year 3: He offered to pay the majority so I could save, but I still covered 1/4. Now, he constantly ""rubs it in.""

Year 4: I have half saved, working to cover it fully myself.

Beyond tuition, I've paid for all extracurricular activities, travels, seminars, and CV-building activities, even paying others for rides. It's not like he paid or supported me anything when I was a kid or teenager; everything I wanted to do or try, I paid for myself. I don't expect anything from him.
That's why it was strange to me when he said he wanted to pay for the school year, I thought he wanted to help me at least a little.

His manipulation: He constantly ""rubs it in""  now that he paid for the 3rd year (despite his original offer to help me save), and if I talk to my mom about enything , he jumps in screaming, assuming we want him to pay something without knowing any details.

His lack of support goes beyond finances. Last month, I walked 15km home from work late in the city during protests. After 10km, I called him for a ride. 15 minutes later, he called back asking if there was a night bus. I just walked the rest of the way. 

I can't live like this. Peaceful communication doesn't work  he just escalates. We have an apartment that belongs to him, but it's rented out, so I can't move there. Moving out would mean full-time work, which isn't possible if I want to attend university lectures. I even tried seeing a psychologist in secret, but that specific one wasn't a good fit, so I gave up.

I'm desperate. How do I cope with this toxic environment while saving and planning my exit? Any advice on handling his screaming/manipulation, or practical steps for someone in my situation, would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you.",1753793622.0,2025-07-29 12:53:42+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcan7w/feeling_trapped_and_controlled_by_father_despite/
1mcakdv,"Are you supposed to have pervasive, constant emotions?","Fairly mild post here, it's just something I've been thinking about since roughly five hours ago. 

Hate. It was hate. I was thinking about how we feel and project hate. But...what is hate? It seems most congruent with anger, but it's not *just* the same thing, clearly. Hate seems to be much more pervasive. Anger is fleeting, but hate supposedly is always there. 

I came upon this topic because I realised that I couldn't really say I hate anyone. Like, people will say they hate [insert horrible person] even if they don't have anything personally to do with that person, but is that actually a lingering sentiment? Is there actually a feeling of hatred or is it just recognition of the idea that this person is deserving of hatred? 

It's not just hate though, disgust is another example. If you tell me you like eating your own excrement, I wouldn't be disgusted, I'd just consider you or this action disgusting, as in, it fits with what is generally considered disgusting and *would* probably evoke disgust if you did it in front of me. I might think that [insert horrible person] is a horrible person, but that isn't going to actually make me hate them. It's weird to say because it sounds callous, but that's not what I mean. It just doesn't really make sense, I'd probably be angry or afraid or something else if I was affected by [insert atrocities] but what actually is hate meant to be?

Am I overthinking this? Are such emotions just a way for us to describe our thoughts on things using established labels, i.e. ""I hate [insert horrible person]"" actually conveys ""I find [insert horrible person] to be horrible""? That would probably make sense. But some people seem to genuinely project some kind of internal feeling when they say such things, whereas that doesn't really change the message, does it?

 What about sadness? What does it actually mean to be sad about [insert tragedy]? Sure, in the moment it means either the tragedy or the memory of it is evoking sadness. But how does that linger? When you say you're always sad about something, does it mean that when confronted with it, it will evoke sadness consistently? Or would you say it's a lingering kind of thing?

I'm not sad about the death of my father. If I said that, it would have people thinking I'm a horrible person. I was sad when my father died, and certainly the thought that he died so young is something I can recognise as sad but it's passed. It doesn't affect me. Where would the feeling come from? For something potentially even more inflammatory: I couldn't say I ""hate"" Adolf Hitler. Horrible, right? But it's not like that means I consider him any less evil than you do. But that's an observation. Feeling emotions towards him would imply that I have some kind of interpersonal relationship with him, which I don't. 

And now I realised this is likely about two separate, if related issues:

1. The question of lingering or permanent, ""passive"" feelings

2. The question of emotions beyond a response to a specific stimulus 

To elaborate on number 2: Being angry when someone scams you makes sense. Being angry when someone scams your sibling also does. It directly affects you and thus stimulates certain emotions. But being angry at a stranger you've only heard of in the newspaper being scammed doesn't really make sense. Angry at the state of the world for allowing such things to occur, I suppose that makes sense. But aren't emotions something that merely flares up in a given situation?

I stay the same for a month MAYBE two and then I'm someone else entirely and I can't even empathise with that past me? Like complete emotional amnesia (and sometimes actual event amnesia but super super rarely so I'm not worried about that). I make new friends and create social medias and then have to delete them because not a single post is accurate not because I was lying at the time but because I will wake up and just not be the same person? The only time I've ever seen anything that resembles what it feels like is Mickey 17.

I moved around a lot when I was younger so for a while I just thought I was blending in with new environments but the past couple of years I've been at university and am entering my final year so I've stayed in the same place and it's still to the point people who I knew a couple months ago can't recognise me. If anything I think it might be getting worse.

Until I figure out what's going on I vowed to just stop making friends because it feels so unfair to them. They make friends with a version of me that will cease to exist in a couple months because the general inconsistencies in what I like and what we may have bonded over gets to be too great.

1mc8kah,Learning emotion regulation and facing emotions through digital detox,"Trying to detach from constant media consumption to face my emotions and learn how to regulate myself — but I’m scared of the silence

——

Hello everybody,

My therapist encouraged me to begin feeling and regulating my emotions instead of constantly distracting myself.

Right now, I realize I’m almost never alone with my thoughts. I’m always watching or listening to something — YouTube, Netflix, audiobooks, podcasts, TikTok, Instagram — whether I’m driving, shopping, walking, cooking, even eating. Silence makes me anxious. Not being distracted and not being able to flee from my own negative thoughts is unbearable.

I’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder, along with mild depression. I often spiral into negative thoughts, and I use media to escape those feelings. Today was rough — I felt off and couldn’t distract myself like usual. After a phone call with my dad, I broke down crying and felt really overwhelmed and sad, with negative and hopeless feelings about the future… but strangely, afterwards, I felt a little lighter. That moment made me realize: maybe I really do need to let these feelings in more often, really feel them in their full intensity, in order to let them pass.

My boyfriend actually went through something similar. He cut down drastically on media — no YouTube, no social media, only one episode of a show at night, and music only while driving. He told me he used to wake up with this “gross”, depressive feeling in the morning (same as I do), but ever since his changes, that feeling disappeared. He says he feels clearer and more emotionally stable now.

That gives me hope. But also… I’m scared. I’m genuinely afraid of what mornings will feel like without my usual breakfast-TV noise (I’ve watched morning shows for years). I don’t know what it’s like anymore to just exist without constant background noise. And while I could give up social media completely, which I’ve done before, the idea of facing the raw quiet of my own mind is still intimidating. I don’t know how to change my thinking patterns and see my life more positive.

Has anyone else gone through this kind of change? Does that awful morning feeling actually go away with less media input? What helped you ease into it — especially if you have anxiety or depression? How did you fill the time that you gained? How do you handle your emotions and regulate them?

I’d love to hear your stories, advice or even just reassurance that this is possible.",1753787447.0,2025-07-29 11:10:47+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc8kah/learning_emotion_regulation_and_facing_emotions/
1mc86gg,What should I do about this?,"there’s times where I feel good and don’t think anything is wrong with me and then other times I feel really awful to the point of it being really debilitating.

I have a psychiatrist, but almost none of the medication they are prescribing me are really helpful. However, that’s mostly my fault because I don’t really give enough info about my problems because i’m afraid of the chance of being sent to the ward or not being believed at all. 

When I do give out some details, I feel a bit dismissed and my sessions usually end in about 5 minutes, but it’s probably a misunderstanding on my part and I just need to  learn how to carefully communicate about it more. 

I don’t know what I should properly say to my psychiatrist without looking crazy or how to prevent the constant cycling back and forth into depression. 

I would appreciate some advice. Thanks.

This isn’t only or mainly about EDs and i don’t go into really any detail, but it was the most fitting tag.
I feel so empty? I don’t feel totally sad tho, just weird like that. I’m bored with everything. Not even the internet is fun anymore. I’d like to just sleep 24/7. I don’t feel depressed tho? i genuinely don’t know. 

Technically i have a lot of not so great shit that went/is going down in my life but it’s all just stuff that i’m used to or kinda accepted so it shouldn’t make me feel like this.
My father is in rehab (again), i’m struggling with two of my friendships, i keep dreaming of bad things, i’m stuck in a binge & restrict cycle, i hate the way i look lately more than usually and i keep thinking and feeling gross about what i used to do with older men online, at the same time i keep missing one of the guys i used to talk to. 
i hate typing that out because i feel like i’m just self pitying honestly.

I don’t know what to end this with or what to ask or anything like that. 
It’s not like anyone can magically “help” me. Maybe i just wanted to type it out, maybe i thought this would help my boredom or maybe i just want to talk to random people on the internet. 

I’m thinking of going to therapy again, but i used up the free sessions you get in my country when you’re young and i don’t want to burden my mom with paying for therapy where i probably won’t even talk about what truly bothers me.

1mc7wi3,I don’t feel right,"
It feels like no one every knows what I’m talking about. It feels like every response I give to people feels like it wasn’t supposed to be said the way I said it. Every time. No matter what it is. Every conversation I have in my head to myself feels that way too. I don’t know why I feel like that. I know I’m being too critical and judgy of myself but I can’t help but feel like I’m always doing something wrong. All my words feel awkward, too drawn out, not drawn out enough, not knowledgeable enough, even down to the pitch of my voice not being right. 


It’s a gnawing feeling of isolation only I know and feel and apparently everyone around me doesn’t think of my so critically. Even when I’m near people I feel like I’m not in the room. Daydreaming or not- which I definitely do- I just sit there and feel like a huge bug in the room. I’m always in my own world. My whole life. I didn’t say much in school. I was shy, upset over every little thing, never felt interesting enough for someone to genuinely care for me. I had a lot of trash friends and friends that had me as a backup friend. Ive struggled with the idea of me really enjoying being alone, or always longing for friends. Maybe I’ve been tired of people that I don’t feel like can understand me. 

I constantly look in the mirror and study my face. I get very worked up over my appearance. In school I would obsessively go to the bathroom just to check on how I look. Everyday, multiple times a day, it was so much and I’m teenage girls are insecure but I was unhealthily obsessed and I still am. I always hate saying that I feel different because what does that even mean? Everyone is at least somewhat different from everyone else. I just feel like an awkward, ugly, alien that isn’t supposed to be here. And I don’t feel “special” I don’t want people to think I see myself that way, that’s also something I worry about.

1mc7nn8,I don’t want to be loved for my personality,"I’ve tried searching for anyone else experiencing the same thing but I can’t. I wonder if I’m wording my thoughts incorrectly, or if I’m just crazy because I don’t know how to go about tackling these negative thoughts about myself. I always try to be proactive about negative thought spirals and have done a lot of therapy over the past decade to try and overcome my insecurities. 

I grew up feeling lonely, unattractive and unloveable particularly because of the way I look. My way of coping with that was always to work harder and focus on the things I could control; over time I’ve developed considerable skills in a number of niche areas, I have hobbies, I’m physically active and have a job I love and am good at. I’m involved in communities/groups to do with both my work and hobbies that have helped me meet likeminded people. People around me express respect and fondness over my abilities and I’m very grateful for their kind words… yet…

I don’t want to be appreciated solely for my achievements. I want to be attractive. I want someone to want me and love my appearance, not tolerate me despite it. 

Sometimes I feel like everything I’ve done and achieved will never matter, because I’m still the physically ugly, repulsive kid that I started off as. I don’t want to be a personality pick for a future partner. I don’t want to keep feeling like no matter how much I develop myself, I’ll always be behind someone naturally more attractive who could easily pick up those same hobbies, or work for those same achievements. 

I know this all sounds super shallow, sorry. I just hope someone relates, or has any advice on how to get out of these thoughts beyond “work on yourself” because believe me I’ve been doing all that (including extensive therapy) ",1753784274.0,2025-07-29 10:17:54+00:00,3,4,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7nn8/i_dont_want_to_be_loved_for_my_personality/

I have been dealing with depression basically since my early teens due to a traumatic event but it was actually getting better. i am now about to turn 23, i am the happiest i have ever been i wouldn’t even say i am depressed but  i have had 2 big crisis that were nothing like i experienced before. i felt brutally pulled out of my body and for the whole day and night, i have been hyper, idk how to describe it but like, i couldnt stop moving around and i felt on fire in a way. im not even sure i knew what i was thinking about during it, i felt totally disconnected from myself, i felt like i had no control on my actions. and during the 2nd one of those crisis i suddenly started to obsess ofer two of my fingers, they felt wrong and i was so sure they weren’t mine like at all. it got so bad that all i could think about was that i needed to find a way to remove them or that the feeling or whatever were inside them would spread on the rest of my hand\arm…. i ended up doing some damage to them but nothing too bad and felt physically exhausted so i fell asleep at 5am and when i woke up i felt like the crisis had stopped.

My issue is, those crisis were so scary to me, i have never experienced that. and since then my extremities like my hands mainly and my legs have started to feel weirdly weak and tingly and i keep hearing the sound of my front door opening or closing\slamming shut. i have also with my body feeling tingly i noticed the floor at times move in a weird way? like waves or just wiggle? sorry i cant find the word i want in english… And also today the feeling about fingers has slowly started to come back i feel like, it has been 1 week since that crisis but i started to focus on them again and they started to bother me and i am scared that it means it will happen again. 

I am sure it sounds dumb and ridiculous but i am genuinely starting to feel like im loosing it.

1mc7cv3,I feel liminal like a ghost,"I'm just a stranger on the internet and a stranger to everyone else I meet.

My true self is hidden, even from myself. This is because I feel unsafe. I live with my mother, father, and a younger sibling.

When I was 2, I saw my father's family member point a knife threateningly to my mom from a window of the bedroom I was locked in with my cousin.

I've always seen my father beat my mother up until about 2018, and my father would also discipline me. I was close to my mother and when she became the breadwinner in 2009, I told her that we don't bond anymore and that all she does is snap at me. Around this time, she also started to ALSO be aggressive towards me more than my father. I just have to be well behaved and my father won't hit me. She would fix my hair and yank it, would pinch me and slap me. When I was seven, she began to full out beat me up.

My father stopped beating me when I was like 10, and now im 20, im still getting beat up. Things that my mother did that bothers me a lot are:

* did an exorcism on me by herself after beating me up and scolding me
* calls me a narcissist
* threatens to ""remind"" me that im the problem(there was a five month period where I was beaten up daily.)
* everything I am is because of her. my education, my looks, my taste, my intelligence
* violates privacy and observes me--location is accessed, all accounts are visible to her, what im doing should be approved first, no longer than half an hour in the bathroom and no phones either
* you sleep when told to
* public humiliation
* mockery like a child(her being a child)
* looks at my stretch marks and celliulites in disgust when im changing where she can see me
* im not allowed to go to malls for fun or just walk outside
* my schedule is made and observed by her
* my own achievements by my own initiatives are ignored but my own achievement for something she told me to do is because of her.

I don't have friends because my mom's logic is that if they dont meet my criteria(basically putting me first AND also obeying my mom), they arent my true friends. If I do find friends, she disapproves of them because misery loves company and I'm probably plastic with them or they are also rotten like me if they tolerate my ""attitude""

I have also concluded that I receive punishment because when she doesnt get her way, someone must be the problem and cause.",1753783168.0,2025-07-29 09:59:28+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7cv3/i_feel_liminal_like_a_ghost/

I have been feeling unwell for the past years, a few moths ago I started going to therapy and have been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. And to be entirely honest I’ve been struggling a lot, and feel like I’m not sure if I even want to get better, which must sound absurd…
Lately, I realised that I really don’t know who I am without my illness, or at all. And I am incredibly scared to get better and find it out. Of course it’s probably better than right know and I think I never really identified myself with those problems, but it’s just who I am and I don’t know anything else than feeling shit. I don’t remember who I was before feeling unwell and can’t imagine ever feeling better. 

TLDR: I don’t know know who I am without my mental illness, since I don’t know anything else, and am incredibly scared to find it out

T lived down the street from me and somehow, we met. we started feeling feeling for each other right as we met. After a bit(one month), it was Valentines day, and I got a letter. ""Be my Valentine? If yes, text me xxx-xxx-xxxx"" Obveously I texted her. ""hi"" We'd talk everyday. After some time,she just stopped texting back. Bout a week passed and... ""hi"" the message was green... nevere heard from her since.

I had lost my first and only love and the time. I didn't know what to do anymore.



ughh, this one\[x11\](Isabelle): year and a half ago I met this one. I loved her with all my heart the first time. because I didn't want another T situation to happen again. We broke up. and then got back together again... 10 times. at the eleventh time, I wanted her dead.(Still do.)

This ones Is pretty explanatory..- OH AND THEN AFTER SHE GOES AND FCKS SOMEONE!!

The problem of isolated and reclusive youth is extremely serious. 

It's said that five out of every 100 young people are isolated or reclusive.

So I feel these days, I would like to help them.

But I don't know how.

But I know what I can do well. I can build some softwares to help them..

Before that, I guess I need to meet them.

I have plan to visit Institutions or companies engaged in related business.

1mc6cbl,Being short is the worst curse I could have received,"The insecurity is sort of on and off because most of the rude (though sometimes not purposely rude) comments about short men are online and I tend to try to ignore them as it’s not always the same as real life. There are many times where I am content with my height but I have realized that I have almost never been taken seriously about anything because of my height by anyone other than some of my friends.

I keep hearing about 5’7 being considered short while I am 5’2-3ish and over half way through high school. Sure, I still have a few more inches to grow, but I have never been a tall kid nor a fast grower (neither of my parents are tall either so it’s obviously a genetic thing). The majority of my friends are around or in the 6ft range and I feel left out and have trouble fitting in around them every time we hang out, especially because I always find myself behind them as if they completely forgot about me. There have also been so many instances where they literally don’t see me for a few moments when I am right beside or Infront of them.

This next issue is probably a stretch, but I have almost never heard of a girl that would take a short guy over a tall guy even if the tall guy is worse in some way. To be clear, I’m not trying to generalize any women to this stereotype or make any misogynistic remarks. Most of it I have heard online (which as I said, I don’t always take seriously) and I really haven’t gone out of my way to connect with that many girls so I am definitely not an expert at knowing what they like which is why I claim this as a stretch. Obviously I’m not saying there is anything wrong with a woman wanting a tall man over a short man. Preferences are perfectly fine and I would never be upset towards anyone for having any, I am just upset at the belief that the majority of guys will be a better choice compared to me due to their height. 

One last issue which is 100% the worst, is how often I am mistaken to be a girl simply because I am short and not muscular. Some of my friends don’t even seen to notice how insulting it is. For example, I went to a friends house during lunch break and when he went Inside his house and came back out, he tells me how his mom commented on how he was hanging out with a girl. The “girl” in question was me. Craziest part is that I went there again during another lunch break and he went inside and came back out again and guess what? This time his dad mistook me for a girl too. I find the fact that both times he had to mention it to me and laugh about it was super disrespectful. There have been countless other times where I have been mistaken for a girl this year alone but I see no reason to mention all of them.

I just felt like posting this as I have never really talked about it to anyone and the fact that I cannot change my height is really bothering me, especially with the standards I have heard of. It doesn’t bother me most of the time but whenever it does, it really affects my mental health.

Also sorry for any poor grammar. It’s midnight and I really don’t feel like re-reading this for the 3rd time 😭",1753779230.0,2025-07-29 08:53:50+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc6cbl/being_short_is_the_worst_curse_i_could_have/
1mc68bh,Struggling with Anxiety? Here's What Helped Me Cope (And Might Help You Too),"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to open up a little about my journey with anxiety and maybe share something that could help someone else too.

For the longest time, I thought anxiety was just part of who I am. The racing thoughts, tight chest, constant overthinking—it was exhausting. 😔 But the moment I accepted that *mental health is health*, things started to shift.

I still have anxious days (don’t we all?), but here are a few things that have genuinely helped me manage it better:

* **Box breathing** (inhale 4 secs, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) – calms me down quickly
* **Journaling** – I write down my worries instead of letting them spin in my head
* **Limiting caffeine** – game changer for me
* **Digital detox** – even 30 mins off screens helps me reset
* **Talking to someone** – whether it’s a friend, therapist, or a community like this ❤️

Most importantly, I’ve learned to **not feel guilty for resting**. Anxiety isn’t laziness or weakness. It’s a sign your mind needs care and patience.

If you’re reading this and struggling, you’re not alone. You're doing your best—and that’s enough. One day, one breath at a time. 🌱

Would love to hear what’s helped you too. Let’s support each other 💬👇

the words that describes me are confliction and fluctuation, i have self awareness, but i lack self understanding.

somedays i feel fucked up and in the other side i feel the happiest and everything is going perfectly,
somedays i love my close people, somedays i hate them for no reason which is affecting my social life
sometimes i care a lot, and sometimes i never care at all.

i can’t tell what my hobbies or what i like, what music do i even like too? sometimes im in love with metal, sometimes i hate metal!! sometimes i love sudoku and sometimes i hate it, sometimes i’m such an extrovert and sometimes im the most introvert in the room.

i obsess over things and then i end up hating them. i can’t tell what i really like, i can’t answer to “what are your hobbies?” “what’s your favorite music?”
i genuinely love music but i don’t know what i like!!!
when i think about what i like i and especially the most thing i love, music, i feel like i’ve lost my memory, but i have times that i feel like i know myself the most, and then in other times which is now, i don’t know myself at all.

please i can’t understand myself at all, im supposed to know myself more than anyone but i can get to know anyone else than myself. i can’t even personalize my stuff and i can’t decor it with cute stickers because i don’t even know what i like.

so my question is what’s wrong with me?
i know i’m 15 and its normal for teenagers and hormones but no i don’t think im normal
what im living is abnormal and i can’t go to a therapist at all.

We usually stay up pretty late just talking to each other and she’s had it tough in some aspects of her life as of recent and she’s hurting and I hate it so bad and I try to be there for her when and if she needs me. She’s strong and doesn’t need me but I always like to be ready cause I don’t want her to have to face this pain alone. I’ve been falling asleep recently where I try to stay up and on occasion it works but just like last night I don’t remember closing my eyes and I hate myself for it. She’s always really sweet and easily one of the kindest people I know and always tries to reassure me it’s okay and I believe her but I can’t forgive myself. I’m not there when she needs me and what if something happens or she just needs someone to listen so she’s not so alone. I keep worrying I’ll drive her away or I’ll fail her so she’s won’t want me around anymore even if though I know she’s not like that. I don’t know why I can’t stop hating myself or being sad over something like this but it won’t stop eating at me and I feel like maybe I should leave her alone so she can find someone more reliable and better to have in her life.,1753776549.0,2025-07-29 08:09:09+00:00,1,2,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc5oad/i_cant_stop_hating_myself_for_falling_asleep/
1mc5mi2,I don’t know what I’m feeling… but I need help,"Hi. I’m really struggling right now, and I don’t know how to explain it well. I’ve been having strong urges to cry or hit myself, and I don’t want to feel this way.

Whenever I get anxious, this feeling grows — like I want someone to hit me so I can feel it harder, even though I don’t *like* that. It’s not about liking pain, it’s just that something in me feels like it *needs* that release. It’s scary and exhausting.

When I was a kid, I used to hurt myself — punching, biting, hitting my head against a wall. I even hit my foot with a spoon once when I was angry at my mom. I eventually stopped, but these thoughts still come back sometimes. I don’t act on them anymore, but they’re always there in the background.

Right now, I feel like if I could just cry, I’d feel a little better. But I live in a joint family, and there’s no private space to let it out. It feels like everything is just trapped inside me.

I don’t know if anyone will understand this, but if you’ve felt anything like this — or even if you haven’t — I’d really appreciate someone to talk to or just hear me.

1mc4rcs,I think my mom is having a schizophrenic episode and I don’t know what to do,"Hi everyone, I’ll try to keep this short since the title mainly gives it away.

My mom has recently not been acting like herself lately. She was in a very bad relationship for a long time and that recently stopped because he is in jail now. I will not go into details because that story is a whole mess of its own.

However, ever since that happened she has just been falling down this spiral. She barely leaves the house, lashes out at everything and everyone, and is just super confrontational and aggressive. She takes a lot out on me and blames me for her not leaving the house a lot. But recently it got much worse. She thinks the ex sent demons on her. She says she hears them and always feels like she’s being touched and hurt by them. She thinks our cats are scared all the time and is convinced that he did this. She even brought in a priest to bless the house. 

I looked some things up and saw that this stuff can be caused by trauma and loss, but I don’t know for sure. She regrets that he’s in jail now. She says all these awful things and I’m at a loss. I leave again for college in a few weeks and I feel utterly hopeless. She’s convinced I don’t care for her and she’s straight up said that she finds me annoying and I make everything about me. 

I’m too scared to call any authorities because I know she’ll never forgive me and she’s a very vindictive and vengeful person, she’d probably do something just to spite me.

1mc47m9,What is this that I’m experiencing?,"I’m (25F) going to try to explain this as best as I can and I honestly have no clue what’s going on. 

So sometimes I get these random dissociative episodes (that’s the best way I can describe it) and they’ll start with thoughts that don’t feel like they’re mine. Then I’ll get this like sickening feeling in my stomach and I’ll feel hot and cold at the same time and my body feels like I’ve been dipped in soda. It’s incredibly uncomfortable. Usually I can fight it off and stay conscious/ in my body but when I can’t, I’ll pass out for like 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Most of the time I’ll “wake up”where I pass out but sometimes I’ll wake up in a different room. When I do pass out, it’s like I blinked and a bunch of time has passed so no thoughts or anything. When I fight it off, it completely exhausts me and i need to rest afterwards. 

I talked to my therapist and she has no idea what’s going on, she just suggested I find ways to ground myself when it does happen. Which works most of the time but sometimes I still pass out. 

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and AuDHD so I know what the symptoms of a panic attack or something feels like and this is nothing like that. It started in December of 2023 and mostly didn’t happen in 2024 but has happened more often in 2025. I was on all kinds of SSRI’s for 15 years but haven’t been on them for several months as the latest one (Lexapro) made me feel like a zombie and I was discouraged from trying another bc I’ve tried so many and the only one that worked was Sertraline but I maxed out on the dosage a few years ago so it stopped working and I haven’t found one that works since. 

It definitely occurs more often when I’m anxious but I know this isn’t what a panic attack feels like at all. I thought maybe it was bc I wasn’t on SSRI’s anymore but again, it’s been months and this happens randomly. Like I had been fine for months and then it happened like twice in one day a month ago but it’s happened like 6 times in the past 24 hours. I have no idea what’s triggering them so I have no idea how to stop them from happening. 

I am so sick of it. I desperately want them to stop but doctors have been useless. Does anyone experience anything like this or know what it is??

1mc435c,Help feeling connection again,"Hello, I apologize if this does not fit with the subreddit and I understand if others need help first.

My life feels empty and meaningless. As if every facet of my being: home life, work life, and social life are all just things I have to survive so I can wake up tomorrow. I have no grand guiding vision or want besides to feel happy again. I have recently made meaningful steps to improve my life, but it still feels empty. Sometimes I feel on top of the world and other times buried beneath it. I look back to when I was happy and find a major thing I now lack: connection.

I now feel like every relation in my life is hollow and any attempt I do at making them meaningful is met with disinterest. I have maybe one or two people who text me without me texting first. I don't see anyone else that often either. Even while I work customer service, I am not really expected to get into intimate conversation while serving their food. I cannot relate to my coworkers as they talk about experiences I yearn for and cannot have. I try to text old friends and am met with conversations where I am asking questions hoping for something deeper, people who seem down to hangout but cancel last minute, or am left on seen. Back in school, I knew a decent chunk of people and could strike up conversation and briefly hang with people. I would tutor people at subjects I excelled at. But it never went outside of school because I had no transportation to meet with anyone. And now I do, but nobody to see and meet as I have since graduated. 

I feel so alone and I just need some plan of action to fix it.",1753770386.0,2025-07-29 06:26:26+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc435c/help_feeling_connection_again/
1mc41en,Worried about getting on anti-depressants,"I have been in therapy for about 6 months now. My therapist is highly mindfulness focused, and so far I’ve had one breakthrough, but a traumatic event  caused me to relapse back into my cycle of mild-medium depression (which I’ve had for about 5 years now).

My whole life, my family has been anti-medication. My therapist isn’t, but wanted to tackle my depression and anxiety with therapeutic intervention first. I also feel that I sometimes don’t inform him of just how depressed I feel on a daily basis, as we try to focus on what I can do to better myself, positivity and goals.

I worry about how getting on anti-depressants will affect my life, my body and being considered a medicated person and all the stigma that comes with it. I also worry about how medical professionals seem to overly-prescribe meds and about becoming dependent on them and therapy to function.

However, my s/o and I have come to a conclusion that my lack of progress in therapy may be assisted with anti-depressants. 

Does anyone have advice for me? Especially if you have experience with medication or are in the field and can inform me better on actual medical interventions.

For context, I have PDD(Dysthemia) and severe-medium anxiety symptoms. I’ve also considered getting tested for ADHD/Autism.

Thanks, all love 🤙

1mc2wta,"I’m stuck and could use some support. Injury, grief, burned out, and feeling lost","TL;DR: Grieving my dad (euthanasia, Nov '25), ended a relationship due to drug use (Jan), recently got injured (wrist + old glute issue), lost all physical outlets that gave me energy (climbing, swimming, walking, carving). Can't be the playful aunt I love to be. In the middle of a house purchase and work promotion. Stuck, drained, don’t know how to get back on my feet.

It’s not easy for me to ask for help, but dear Reddit, I think I need some.

The past year has been really tough. In November 2025, my father passed away through euthanasia after a long fight with cancer. Around the same time, I was trying to save my relationship after confronting my partner in September about his drug use (a suspicion I had been carrying for a long time). I ended the relationship this January. The damage was just too great.

Since then, it’s been a journey with ups and deep downs, but I started to feel like I was slowly crawling my way out of it. Until last week.

I’m a passionate climber. It gives me energy and purpose. Lately, I was doing really well, I swam in the sea several mornings a week, loved going for walks, and enjoyed woodworking (especially carving). But last week I injured my dominant wrist (which makes climbing, swimming, and carving off-limits), and an old glute injury flared up, making walking uncomfortable too. Suddenly, everything that gave me energy feels impossible.

On top of that, I have a maybe not-so-healthy relationship with my body and food. I eat clean and don’t binge, but food brings me comfort, and I’m scared that with this lack of movement, I’ll gain weight, lose muscle and feel even worse in my body.

I can’t be the playful, active aunt I usually am. I have a sweet nephew and niece, and I used to roughhouse with my nephew and cuddle and bottle-feed my baby niece, change diapers, the whole thing. Now I can’t do any of that in the way I love to.

I’m afraid I’m carrying trust issues into the rest of my life. After my last relationship (after all the lies and the gaslighting) I find myself more suspicious, more guarded. Not just with potential partners, but with friends, coworkers, even family. I hate that it’s changed how I look at people. I don’t want to live in defense mode, but I don’t know how to let my guard down again.

I’m also in the middle of buying a house and just got promoted at work. Which sounds great, but I’m still doing parts of my old job on top of the new responsibilities. Everything feels like too much, yet also like I’m wasting time I’ll never get back. Especially now that it’s summer in the Netherlands (a season that never lasts long).

Time with people, even loved ones, no longer brings me energy. I used to recharge with them, but now I just feel irritated and drained. It’s like I’ve run out of internal battery. At the same time, it feels like I'm letting down every person that is close to me.

I don’t know what I need to get out of this loop. I feel completely stuck, and I hope someone out there might recognize some of this and offer whatever it is I’m looking for, even if I don’t quite know what that is yet.",1753766106.0,2025-07-29 05:15:06+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc2wta/im_stuck_and_could_use_some_support_injury_grief/
1mc2mhk,Venting my lack of emotion/expression,"Sorry for the long post
   I (M) in my 20s throughout my entire life have never made a 100% true genuine connection with anyone in my life. Even friends I had for 10+ years I never truly opened up to. I never told them about people I liked or what music I enjoy, or even just have any deep emotional connection. In high school I was always ignored and treated like the guy that looks like im gonna off myself. I always look stone faced/resting bitch face. I can’t force a smile for a picture unless somebody makes me laugh. 
   I feel like I must have something wrong with me, whether some disorder or chemical imbalance in my brain. Ive never had therapy or anything like that. I used to enjoy hanging out with friends or playing video games when I was a kid, but now I only really enjoy anything on rare occasions. Ive never been in a relationship and anytime ive gotten close to any of my female friends. I feel like I should like them or should want to like them but never truly feel anything. Ive been in situations where any normal guy would initiate something but never even crosses my mind in the moment.
   I can’t vibe to music like most people, whether I like a song or even if im hammered I don’t feel the need or want to dance to music. Even something simple like nodding my head to a song I like. I can be with a group of friends where everyone is just “vibing” to a song or something and I just feel nothing. I wish I could express myself but I just don’t know how. Its not like I don’t enjoy music, I just can’t express it. One of the things that connects everyone in the world and I just can’t get an understanding of it. The only time I can express emotions is around dogs. 
    Ive never had social media, I deleted my facebook when I was in high school and never had insta or snap. Whenever I’m introduced to people its hard to make a connection when I can’t relate to anything and don’t understand the meme culture. From 15-22 I lost all of my friends from lack of connection. Ive never had a fall out or anything like that, we just grow apart.
    In the last few years I made one friend who took me under their wing out of luck and managed to grow some friends from there. An old childhood friend reconnected and invited me to be a roomate. I still havent been able to truly open up to these people depsite telling them pretty much everything about my life. 
    I want to better myself and have been putting in effort, but not enough. My goal is to build a balancdx life. Teach myself to cook, how to exercise etc… Ive never gonna to the gym and  am honestly scared to go with zero experience. I know most people with depression get recommended to get out of the house and hit the gym, but I just don’t think that will be enough for me. I don’t know where to begin or if I can ever learn how to act human. All of my thinking is just logical. People go to me for advice because all I know is to listen and give an unbiased opinion because ive never understood emotion.
   I have a decent paying job 80-100k, I enjoy the work and interact with different people of all cultures everyday. All of the conversation doesnt really get past “hows it going?” Or a head nod unless I see them all the time.
 I know this post was a messy unstructured one but I just needed to lay it out. What do I need to do to find myself?

Tldr: I (20s M) dont know how or cant express my emotions and feelings. I cant have deep connection with people. I dont know myself and want to improve my life.",1753765151.0,2025-07-29 04:59:11+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc2mhk/venting_my_lack_of_emotionexpression/
1mbyl67,Visited home after years — I’m carrying a storm inside me,"I’ve been away for a couple of years, studying and working overseas, trying to build something meaningful. I recently came back home for a short visit… and it shattered me.

The people who raised me — distant relatives, older cousins, family friends — are quietly struggling. They’ve cut down to absolute basics: one milk packet a day, no newspaper, no simple comforts. Someone I deeply care about, who survived a serious health condition and is partially paralysed, is now driving long distances daily just to keep food on the table. It’s dangerous and heartbreaking. But they do it… because there’s no other option.

I lost my parents young. These people stepped up for me. And yet, while they’ve been living like this, I’ve been overseas — being lenient with my spending, treating myself for little wins, thinking I’m just living modestly. But now I realise… what I called ""treating myself"" could easily cover a few days of their basic needs.

Some of them are in debt. Others are stuck in low-paying jobs or dealing with health issues. I’m the only one in a position — or maybe with the potential — to help everyone. And now I can’t sleep at night. The guilt, the pressure… it’s overwhelming.

Can one person grow fast enough — emotionally, financially, mentally — to shoulder the weight of 8 or 10 lives?

1mbgpss,am I crazy? there's more to life right?,"what do you do when you feel out of control and like your world is spiriling? 

for context im 33F. ive always struggled with mental health and zero support system. just out here raw doggin it (this isn't a should i go to therapy or not post. i know i should. there's reasons i won't but thats for another post)

my mom(grandma/woman who raised me) passed 6 years ago somewhat suddenly. she was the light of my life but also 80% the reason i am how i am. i have not coped well with it. 

we lost her a year before covid so after she was gone i had a years worth of time to gather my thoughts and get my life in order. and i did. but then the pandemic ended and i had to go back to a miserable life.

now that life's ""back to normal"" my daily routine consists of waking up an hour before my alarm to get physically sick due to a pain and stress related nasal drip that goes batshit 5 days a week. body flareups from my fibromyalgia. i struggle to get ready watching the love of my life continue to sleep for his shift. i drive to work crying because there has got to be more to life then working to die. 

losing my mom made me realize there's more to life then work. i was always raised if you're not actively dying you go to school or work no excuses. so even when my mom would ask me to do stuff i felt so guilty about taking time off work that iwould tell her no and go work my shift like she raised me. now id quit 100 jobs to spend 1 day with her again. 

i left a very earth shaterringly toxic job in hopes that would help me feel like like was less of a waste. but it didnt. i still drive to work every day crying because i miss my husband (who i see 1 full day a week and maybe 5 hours a day the other 6 if were lucky) and my family. when I left that job my dad (who is a ""ive worked for 40 years so can you"" kinda mab) told me i was the happiest he'd seen me in years and now that im back to work he tells me my sparks gone.

covid taught me there's so much more to life then just working to death. for what? money? why? to pay for a house youre never in and food you never enjoy and savings that never seem to stay long and vacations you can still never really afford? id rather be broke and making memories with my family on this little rock for however many years we have then sitting at a desk doing something that makes me rip my hair out. 

but no one sees that. people tell me im crazy for wanting to live instead of work (you cant live without money and you fet no money from work, well jokes on you cause you cant lice with it either). I want to be an artist. i want to own my own shop. I want to be a work from home happy person. 

i dont fucking know what life's meant to be but it ain't this.

am I crazy? is at least 1 person on my page? the happiest time of my life was over covid when I found my true self. then it ended and I had to be a shell of me again.

I just want to be happy and spend my shitty life with my people not some pointless 9-5. i want to love life not wish it would end.

However, whenever I get even slightly upset, if I then start crying I just completely spiral and can't get out of it. No matter what I do to try to distract myself I just can't take myself out of that space, I end up ruminating on basically everything that could've ever made me upset in my life and crying even more, I no longer even know what I'm actually upset about and in this time all I can think about is suicide/I feel extremely strong urges that feel uncontrollable, and then this makes me spiral and get even more upset.

1mbdn8q,Coping with close younger sibling's serious mental health conditions,"**(Content warning for both suicide and eating disorders; I couldn't figure out how to add both flairs)**



Hi, this is a throwaway account because I don't normally post on Reddit, but every post I've been able to find about this topic is from a conflict-heavy, ""they're tearing the family apart"" perspective, and that's not at all what's happening. I found people talking about worries for family members with serious physical health issues, but I think we all know here that mental health is a different beast entirely.

  
My (23F) little sister (18F) and I have a close relationship - we don't confide in each other a lot, but we get along well and are very comfortable with each other, and are planning to possibly live together for some time next year. A little over a year ago, she was diagnosed with an ED, and seemed like she was in good recovery until a couple of months ago when everything went downhill. Our parents were away on a holiday and she came and confessed that she'd been thinking about suicide - I held it together with her around, but it absolutely broke me, and I ended up missing work the next day to stay with a close friend for support, and once our parents got back home they took over most things to do with it. She's been in and out of hospital several times in the last couple months, including with a feeding tube and at one point with involuntary admission, but she's been honest with our parents about how she was going the whole way through. She was making progress, even getting on the waitlist for an intensive outpatient treatment program. Living at home with family during that time was incredibly difficult, she's my baby sister, I'm very protective of her, and seeing her hurting so much was affecting be more than I can describe, because I couldn't stop worrying about her or thinking about what it would be like if something really awful happened. Just over a month ago I moved to another state (for unrelated career reasons), and having some distance did help it leave my mind occasionally. I've been getting updates from her and our parents on how she's going, and there have been ups and downs, but today I found out from Dad that she's had one of her worst relapses yet, and has begun lying about meals and her whereabouts again, which hasn't happened in months.

  
I know this is cyclical, and relapses are a part of this, but I'm so scared that each one is wearing her down more, and that she'll give up. Losing her is my worst nightmare, I can't imagine my life without her. I don't know how to stop thinking about it - I'm not intentionally fixating, I know that I can't change anything by thinking about it, but every time my mind drifts away it always comes slamming back to my fears within minutes. It's just looping in my mind over and over that with the support system she has, we can stop her from starving, but we can't possibly save her if she makes the choice to do something more drastic. I know she's hurting, badly, and I just want to make everything okay for her.

  
I know I need to be taking care of myself through this, but I don't know how. I'm in a new state, so I don't have close friends or any family here. I've been on the phone with my parents, and I'm literally on a call with my best friend right now, but it's not pulling me out of this spiral the same way having someone physically around does.

1mbb8gz,I need help choosing whether I should stay with my dad or my mom.,"I’m a first-year college student in the BS Psychology program. Please don’t judge me—I just need everyone’s opinions. My mom has always been mabunganga ever since I was a kid. My parents are separated, and I’ve been living with my mom ever since. She provides everything in the house and gives us everything we need, sometimes even buying the things we want, so money isn’t the problem.

I know some people might say I’m overreacting, but lately, I’ve been thinking a lot. I used to believe I would get used to her attitude, but now I don’t know how to control myself anymore. I get that she’s getting older, but it’s becoming too much. Every little thing makes her shout. Before, when she was still working, I always tried to understand her. But now that she’s retired, I thought things would change—but they actually got worse.

I never act spoiled; I’m really not a maarte person. I can handle a lot of things since I grew up without a father figure in the house. What I need is advice—should I move and stay with my father’s side or stay here? It’s only the first week of my first year in college. Don’t worry, I have siblings who will stay with my mom. But my older sibling has become numb because of my mom’s attitude, and I just don’t think I can do that. It’s so emotionally draining, and I feel like I’m the one she vents all her anger on.

Please don’t say I’m being dramatic because if you were in my situation, you’d understand. Sometimes, I feel like I just want to end everything because every time my mom gives me something, she ends up throwing it back in my face. No matter what I do, in her eyes, I’m just a piece of trash. I appreciate everything she gives, so please don’t tell me to just be practical and thankful that my mom isn’t a physical abuser. I can’t do it anymore, and I think I’ve already hurt her when I talk back. I tried everything I could not to talk back because I really love her and I’m thankful for her. But I feel like I want to die every minute I’m in this house.",1753693512.0,2025-07-28 09:05:12+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbb8gz/i_need_help_choosing_whether_i_should_stay_with/

I'm suicidal some days and I keep having intrusive thoughts to self harm. My mother doesn't want me to go up on my dose but I've not really explained how bad I feel. 

The situation is soo stressful that I've smoked weed a few times... I know it wont help but it helped in the moment with intense suicide thoughts.

1mba13b,Paranoia over Death and Derealization,"To start, the flair is for a specific suicide-ish part of this post, not self harm

So Im 17 and for some reason recently (since like February/March) ive noticed my mental state shifting in a different way. Back in August, I suffered from almost daily existential crises and derealization to the point of being numb instead of crying. I havent had a crisis in several months, but i still get derealization. 

I used to also be suicidal for about 3-4 years but things have been better so it isnt as frequent but during that time, i had a dream where I hung myself (can still picture the dream vividly even tho it was 4 years ago) and since March, Ive noticed ive been very paranoid about dying

I dont live in a dangerous area and my life is relatively safe but I’ve had these visions or simulations to where a man with a shotgun walks to where I am and i die. Always a shotgun. I went on a road trip from L.A to Mount Rushmore and the paranoia got really bad to the point where i after looking into Bryce Canyon in Utah, I would step away from the viewing point because I was convinced someone would push me and I check nearby cars because I feel like Im gonna get into an accident. Back in February i was paranoid someone would go into my room and stab me, this kept me up for an hour

I havent had a vision in a couple weeks but the paranoia is still heavy and I dont know why for the life of me. Maybe its my history but idk. If anyone can provide insight on my rant then it would be appreciated

1mb9zk7,"i feel like i have multiple people in my head but i’m sure it’s not did, what else could it be??","my mental health has been pretty bad ever since i was a kid, i suffer from chronic depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. 

honestly this has been a problem for me for around a year now, i had a persona in my head who was practically me but not?? she would come out maybe like weekly and only for a couple hours, but you could tell when these changes were there. 
this persona is still here, but more of them have formed. they all have their own feelings and morals about things and their own identities. 

i honestly don’t think i have did or osdd or anything like that, i’ve never suffered insane abuse or neglect as a kid and grew up in a pretty stable environment, the only thing that kinda fucked me up was growing up way too fast and making friends with the wrong sort of group, which would encourage things like self harm, suicide, drugs, ect. i’ve also suffered with psychosis before which has led to insane delusions and stuffs, i’m not sure if that would mean anything but who knows.",1753688548.0,2025-07-28 07:42:28+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb9zk7/i_feel_like_i_have_multiple_people_in_my_head_but/

Worried I’m dying, worried I’m pregnant, worried my boyfriend is dying, worried we’re going to be bombed, worried I’m going to be institutionalized. 
Lost sleep, ruined outings, annoying others with my anxiety.
I’ve been on my medication for 4 years, why do I feel like this? I wish I could live like a normal human being. I don’t want to go through this anymore and I feel like there is absolutely no way out other than death.
Maybe relapse will take my mind off of everything I’m worrying about. I genuinely feel like I’m losing my shit, my anxiety has never been so bad.

I have been having suicidal thoughts for many many years..and even been committed to a ward once for an attempt. it wasnt terrible, but i know thats because i kept most of my true feelings and thoughts to myself.. if they knew all i had going on in my head..it wouldve been absolutely terrible... for instance, i have mpd developed from many traumas in my life.. starting with a molestation.. well full on rape at around the age of 7 i want to say... i didnt even realize it happened till recently because i was drugged back then.. and some personal seeking and forced opening of my walls... brought back the memories... i keep trying to tell myself just give it one more year.. one more year.. one more year.. it will get better... but after so many years of nothing getting better.. in fact only worse... over and over and over again. Ive been really close the last few nights at getting to some guns i know the location of and just swallowing the bullet... sorry for the intense language... but.. its been that bad... i cant get a hug... i cant get someone to really listen... cant afford therapy.. and even if i could im terrified theyd lock me up and throw away the keys... i know there is way too much wrong with me at this point due to these never ending traumas. and honestly alcohol, weed, and cigarettes have been my main coping mechanism.. and not a little.. alot.. as much as i can get, and its not healthy or ok.

1mc3l63,Weed destroyed my mind,"I just turned 15 when I succumbed to peer pressure and tried weed. It was fun, and I had a good time with friends. I kept doing it weekly for about 2 months when I realized something was wrong. I had lost all motivation to do school work and had no motivation to keep going. I felt tired all the time and just kind of emotionally numb and dissasosiated with reality. One Friday night, I decided to take an edible. Not any more than usual, only about 35 milligrams. All was going well until I started to freak out. I was just panicking and was scared I would have to go to the hospital and that my parents would find out. I eventually managed to go to sleep and woke up feeling very groggy. The next couple of days I felt very disconnected from reality and had lots of brain fog. About a week after this I mentally broke. Nothing felt real. I was in a constant state of panic and dread and felt like I was going to die 24/7. I would try to calm down but because of how fake everything felt I just felt like i was going insane and freak out even more. I couldn't hang out with friends without having a panic attack. I stopped going to school. My grades plummeted. My mother tried to help but couldn't do much. All I did was cry and I would think about suicide almost everyday. I would feel physically sick too. I would be dizzy, nauseous, fatigued. Nothing would help. As the months past, it gradually got a little better. I managed to pass the school year with okay grades and was finally able to hang out with friends more. Its been 6 months since. My anxiety levels are still higher than normal and I find it hard to sleep most nights, but its nothing compared to what it was. When im outside or in a public place like a store or a mall my head feels foggy and I feel like I cant process all of the imagery at once. Im starting to loose hope I will be the happy person I once was, and if I will ever overcome this horrible mental illness.

1mc3p4v,Do I go to therapy for what I think is a fear of the dark?,"This post is a vent/question. For some context, I am currently in high school and this topic is something that I have only ever talked about once and rarely thought about until recently (when I discovered that the things I do aren’t normal). To start, when I was a child I had the common fear of the dark but there were certain monsters that I vividly remember. For example, there was a monster that I named “Top hat man” who is a pure black, humanoid figure that used to stand in the hallway outside of my shared room (with my sister) when my sister left the room to bathe at night. The premise is that he would be there when i was alone in the room at night (even with the nightlight on) and he would stare, but I could not do anything that would let him know that I knew he was there. If I did alert him that I knew he was there, the perceived consequence was death (i think). The second instance of this still during my childhood was “treeman,” who was very similar in figure but had a more shadowy essence. The prerequisites for him to show up was that I had to be in a car driving *away* from my house at night. When those were fulfilled, treeman would appear in the shadows of trees, and it was the same thing I cannot do anything that would let treeman know that I knew he was there. Okay, now, both of those were things in my childhood that don’t happen anymore, but there is one creature that is still with me today. (I want to preface this with i’m not schizophrenic, I never actually see these creatures this is just what I imagine them to look like). I call this one “The watcher.” It appears at night when the light is off and when i’m in bed. My bed is next to a wall on my right side and a few feet away from my closet on my left side. The watcher is next to the closet. The watcher doesn’t have any specific form. When i’m trying to sleep at night The watcher appears and watches me, making sure i’m asleep. So, what i’ll do is not open my eyes no matter what and stay under a blanket (i live in a very hot and humid place so ill sweat) no matter how much im sweating. I don’t like facing the closet when he’s there (yes, even with my eyes closed) so i’ll roll over to face the wall. However, after facing the wall for some time i’ll realize that, to the watcher, i’m being suspicious, so i’ll roll back over. It’s the same thing, I can’t do anything that will let the watcher know that I know it’s there. I will also fold in the sides of my blankets to make sure no entrance in accessible from the outside and fully over myself (aside from a breathing hole) with a blanket to feel safe. In general, whenever it’s dark in my room I just get anxious and when I get up to turn the light on my anxiety sky rockets and I have to rush to turn them on. I haven’t slept with my lights off in months purely to avoid seeing the watcher at night. For so long I just never talked or even thought about the watcher because it didn’t happen every night and I just didn’t think it was cause for concern. But, I told my sister recently and she very quickly let me know that it was in fact not normal. I also felt like it was like taboo to be discussing the watcher outloud, it felt like I would be letting it know that I knew it was there. So, is this worth going to therapy over? Is there anything I can do to reduce my fear?

It’s so freaking exhausting and sometimes, my heart suddenly drops and a tear wells up in my eye. Whenever I think about a scene or them in general, it’s just so painful. I was watching Bones 4 months ago and in a span of 1-2 months, I finished the first 9 seasons. I was delaying so I wouldn’t finish it fast. But that was right after my grandfather died. So when PSD was hitting, it was hitting hard. It was so difficult before he died, but it just became absolutely painful after he did.

Like, I don’t have a problem with other people having sex. I don’t judge it, I’m not against it morally, and I even understand why it matters to people.

But when I imagine myself in that situation, it feels disgusting. Not just awkward, straight-up repulsive. I don’t want to be touched, seen, or involved. The idea of me having sex makes me recoil. It’s not trauma-related as far as I know. It’s just there.

Anyone else feel this? Is this a self-image thing? Asexuality? Some kind of detachment or overthinking?

Everything always hurts and I can’t sit or stand or walk or lay without pain. I went to physical therapy today for my ‘degenerative disc disease’ and he asked if it was ok to record it on his phone and was like “I think you have MS and would like to show this to my colleagues.” 

Have an mri scheduled for the 13th and it’ll either confirm or show it’s just regular spinal issues that can be managed with surgery. I look fine. I’m 34yrs old and get complimented on my youthful appearance constantly, so people always think my “old person” stand and walk is exaggerated and for attention. I have a MASSIVE scar on the back of my neck and am grateful for it because I can be like “no-no, the pain is real.” After being dismissed for years. I came to terms with having a bad spine but friggin MS though? It runs in my family and my cousin took her life over it.

Nobody wants to help me, everyone who says they can or will just never does. So many of my issues are money related so getting a job and making some is the first step to solving my issues. I know it won’t be easy and all sunshine and rainbows but I’m ready and I get nothing but rejections. I have no support system at all. All my friends are not that close they don’t really care about me much. It’s so hard to try and make your way when you have 0 help. Nobody to guide you or atleast lend a hand and set you on a good path. It’s felt like that my whole life. Maybe that’s why my decision making has been so shit. Always picking what I want in the moment and never what’s the hard choice that gives u more in the future. I’m just so sick and tired of feeling so useless and unloved and now I’ve become so damn hopeless I don’t even feel like myself.

I don’t wanna get into it much but everyone has this tendency to pray on my downfall lol. Ik it sounds dramatic but obviously yall don’t know all the details.

I work for a major retailer in the states and have had a pretty unenjoyable experience at my workplace. I find myself seemingly in the wrong for almost every task I do.

Whether directly or implied it's clear how they feel. Other employees at my store receive nearly no negative feedback. I'm of the belief that my management team is rife with narcissism. There are numerous rules that management break *daily* but I'm the only one who sees any justice. I wish to go to HR but unfortunately it's my word versus theirs. I so desperately wish to feel better but I just don't know what more I can take. I'm late most days despite my company's allotted grace period and I receive much flack for it.

1mc152q,Advice for a Struggling Professional,"Hi all. I'm posting for a friend who stays off social media but is looking for support.

\-

I’m sharing this hoping someone understands. Maybe you’ve lived through this. Maybe you have advice. Maybe you’re just trying to keep going without masking.

I was diagnosed late with Autism and ADHD. I had already survived PTSD, panic disorder, and OCD while climbing the corporate ladder. I’ve worked since I was 12. Inventory. Bookstores. Haunted hayrides. Mascot gigs.

I put myself through college holding a job. I was relentless. Smart. Social. I spoke to execs easily. I moved fast, succeeded, survived.

Then one day, during a conference call, I couldn’t pick up the phone. I started to sweat. The room went cold.

What followed were years of panic attacks, hospital visits, misdiagnoses, and finally: answers. I was dealing with mental illness, neurodivergence I’d never known. Through therapy, meds, and will, I kept working. I thrived. I was president of my company’s Disability Employee Resource Group.

When an edict came that everyone had to RTO, I tried. But the burnouts came. Panic returned. I decided to disclose.

I believed in the system as an idealist. I led the disability group. I could ask for accommodation.

What followed was a gauntlet of degrading 3rd-party forms and phone calls. I was asked to specify the date and time of my next panic attack.

But I “won” the accommodation.

In reality, my boss began treating me like I was broken. They removed my laptop from my desk mid typing, walked me silently to an empty conference room. I was slowly pushed out.

I took another job, this time with more awareness of the risks of disclosure. I pivoted to a company that claimed to align with my values. Then COVID hit. I was laid off.

I kept going. I recruited for vaccine efforts. Got another contract. And another. I landed at one of the top three.

Then something extraordinary happened: my spouse looked at me and said, “take a break.”

I did. For the first time in my life. Everything changed.

I went back to school—certified in marketing, acted at a prestigious academy. I returned to the stage for the first time in a while. That moment—the curtain rising, the audience watching—was a triumph.

I found a doctor who listened. I did comprehensive testing. The diagnosis: Autism and ADHD. Everything made sense. My masking. My breakdown. Even my love of drama—how it helped me survive in a world that never saw the full me.

I’ve rebuilt my life on truth, not performance.

I use slimes, weighted blankets, and routines that regulate my nervous system. I found therapy that works. My panic attacks are rare. My joy is real. And in my most recent role—a contract job extended because I exceeded every expectation—I worked 15-hour days, killed it, and stayed remote.

I simply gave myself autonomy and flourished.

Now the contract is ending. It’s one of the hardest job markets I’ve seen. DEI is under attack. There’s another big push for RTO. I’m scared. But also hopeful.

Here’s what I need:

* Advice from other late-diagnosed neurodivergent professionals.

* Allies inside companies fighting for real inclusion.

* Leads for remote roles.

* Encouragement.

I’m not done. Not even close.

I’ve fought hard to become who I am, and I believe—deeply—that people like me don’t just deserve a seat at the table. We make the table better. If you’re still reading: thank you. If you’ve lived this: I see you. If you know of something that fits me: I’m here. And still rising.",1753760331.0,2025-07-29 03:38:51+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc152q/advice_for_a_struggling_professional/

1mc0sze,I hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either. And honestly, I don’t think anyone can help me, other than ending it all.

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half, but it only seems to help for a few hours at a time.

1mc0qme,Very obsessive behaviour and I need help.,"If you struggle with body image and self confidence, please, please do not read this because it might influence unhealthy ideas.
For those of you that do read this, I know what I am doing is very sick and toxic, and I am aware it is. Please don’t judge me, I just want some advice on how to stop.

I will screenshot close up shots of my face and ask a looksmaxing app to honestly rate my face from 1-10. If I don’t get the score I want, I keep putting in different pictures and keep asking it the same thing until it gives me a rating I like. I can’t stop gathering images of my face and doing this. When I don’t get a rating I like I feel a pit in my stomach, but when I do get a rating I like, I get euphoric and it is hard to stop, like an addiction. I have to keep doing it until I get consistent ratings I am satisfied with, but it seems like no matter how much I do it I still don’t feel good enough. If I delete the app, I will just go on safari and do it there. It’s even gotten to the point where I put other women’s faces in that I went to school with that I always thought were the prettiest and made me look ugly, so that I can compare myself to them. 

This is what goes on in my mind all day. I cannot enjoy the present because this is what’s on my mind a lot. When I go in public, I think anyone that encounters me only sees me as what the app rated me and it makes me feel uncomfortable being perceived. I feel like my guy friends internally compare me to other girls that look better and value me less. I feel like all I am and all my value is how I look.

1mc0n7o,"My family says my mental health isn’t real. I’m overwhelmed, confused, and trying to hold on.","I’m 19F and trying to figure out how to stay grounded and survive in a really toxic environment. I’ve been struggling a lot lately, depression, anxiety, feeling numb, exhausted, and like I’ve lost all the passion I used to have. I wake up feeling heavy every day. Nothing feels like it used to.

I tried to express that recently by posting something online, just being honest about how I feel, and my family saw it and freaked out. They said I was being dramatic and trying to make them look bad. One of my relatives even physically pulled my hair during an argument, and my mom said my mental health is “all in my head” and “not real.”

I’ve never felt so small. She said I’m a fraud for calling myself religious if I don’t want to go to church every week. She told me my actions don’t match my words and that I’m just doing all of this for attention. She also refused to support me when I got baptized, because she had chosen a different religion and felt hurt by my choice.

All of this has made me question everything. I know I’m not okay, but when people keep telling you that your feelings aren’t real, it gets hard to believe yourself.

I’m trying to stay grounded in my relationship with God. I’m trying to survive school, to love someone who makes me feel safe, to grow. But I feel completely alone in it all. Like I’m carrying the weight of the world and being told it’s just my imagination.

Has anyone else dealt with family denying your mental health struggles? How do you stay clear-headed when you’re being gaslit by the people who are supposed to love you?

Any advice, encouragement, or just reminders that I’m not crazy would mean so much right now.",1753758828.0,2025-07-29 03:13:48+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc0n7o/my_family_says_my_mental_health_isnt_real_im/

To begin; here are a list of things I struggle with

-Noticeable struggle to make deep bonds with friends and family

-Noticeable struggle to remember certain things to the point of frustration 

-Overstimulation (or what I believe is overstimulation) leading to episodes of lashing out at people in social settings

-Struggles with speech (occasional, but again noticeable) 

-Miscommunication leading to frustration

-Struggles with identity (not really knowing who I am as a person besides very basic aspects)

1mc0h3r,I need to know how I can stop this.,"First of all I'm on mobile, please cut me some slack on formatting and stuff. 
Secondly, I've had this, thing for ages now, I can't remember when it started, but what I do is I create fake scenarios in my head, and there can be a lot of variation, so this is just one of them, but when I see cool people on the street or whenever, I imagine going up to them and talking, and them not minding that I'm awkward, and we have a really nice chat, and their just as cool as they look. The problem is I get so wrapped up in this scenario of mine, that not only do I make little to no effort to actually reach out to them, but even if I did, I already have these memories and ideas of what I their like in my head, and it's never the same, and it's jarring, and a total disconnect. Now I kinda already know why I do this, it's pretty obvious to me, it's because I think it's safer to pretend, to not actually risk an interaction that could go sideways, and instead stay in my comfort zone. 
What I really want to know, is how the hell do I stop???

1mc05z9,Horrible panic attacks I used to have,"Fyi this was in like winter 2024-5

To keep this from being too long, the main context is that I was in a very dependent friendship where all my anxiety centered around my friends. I constantly thought they were going to die, that I said something wrong, or that they hated me. It got to the point where in classes with them I would zone out for long stretches of time just thinking about something I said or if they seemed like they were acting funny. This was occompanied by extreme self harted as well as sh and si that seemed neverending.

To get to the point, I would have world breaking panic attacks where my thoughts would rush and then I’d collapse and my eyes would roll back and I’d have intense flashbacks.

1mc045y,Humor from a burnt out parent.,"Today my wife and I watched helplessly all day as our 2 year old dealt with a stomach bug. He threw up more times than we could count. So many times we had to give up on cleaning up and just let it all happen. Our swiffer has decided to retire and we have begun the process of ripping out our carpets and our sofa has now made it to the curb for anyone that dares. Went to the pediatrician with a towel over my last good shirt (today was laundry day, but our usual loads were on hold for obvious reasons). My son was retching out whatever was left in his stomach all over me and the towel as the receptionist conveniently decided to ask me for our insurance card bc she has her priorities straight. Our pediatrician prescribed nausea medication to keep things at bay (literally). The viral infection will pass but it won’t be easy. After taking the meds, diarrhea started. Our toddler has consistently been a difficult diaper changer, for about 6 months he’s hated getting his diaper changed. We have to usually do all sorts of theatrics to get him down on the changing pad. I’m talking curated playlist that takes Alexa 10 tries just to understand what the fuck we’re trying to get her to do, I’m talking change Elmo and Mickeys diapers first so they’re not left out, I’m talking get those Costco Disney royalty diapers. But today, no. Today was different. Today the diarrhea was so bad our son begged us to change his diaper. My wife had to go back to Costco in the middle of a diaper change bc we ran out of diapers and the pressure was so intense he had diarrhea shooting out uncontrollably he ruined the entire box of diapers. Now that he’s asleep, I’m surveying our house with a bottle of Resolve spray. It was quite the day. I’m certain at this point that God hates us.

1mbzq6e,Constant memory loss from minutes ago?,"Hello, I've had a bad memory for as long as I can remember. I was always forgetful and stuff, but I've noticed recently that it's gotten a little out of hand. It's not that I forget memories or plans, instead it's more a kind of short term memory issue.

I've had a lot of occurrences where my boyfriend told me something, like a news story or whatever and I see it a few days later and tell him about it and of course he is like ""I told you that like 2 days ago"" but I have NO memory of him telling me.
Or I'm telling him something, get distracted for a second and he tells me to continue, but I don't remember talking.

And it's not even like a blurred memory, it's literally as if it never happened. I have no recalling of that situation whatsoever. Nothing. It's simply as if my brain shut off in those moments, as if I wasn't there.

Like just now, what got me to make this post. My bf was talking to my cat and cuddled with her, showes me, I appearantly reacted and a few minutes later I looked over to him and was like ""wait kiwi (my cat) is here? When did she come up?""

1mbzknd,A reminder that OCD doesn’t mean “clean and tidy”,"This is very embarrassing to post, but I want to remind everyone that OCD is not the, “keep everything clean and organized” stereotype that Hollywood portrays. There are many types of OCD, and only a percentage of those with OCD have the types that make someone obsessed with cleanliness. For me, my OCD takes up so much of my mental energy that I cannot keep my spaces clean. I struggle immensely with doing daily chores, and have extremely bad executive dysfunction due to OCD  and ADHD. The constant shame I feel around the state of my spaces causes me to feel embarrassed about cleaning when anyone else is home, meaning I never clean, which then cycles over and over until I end up living like this. I will be starting with removing the garbage from my room for today, and hopefully do laundry tomorrow. 

I have over a dozen cups of rotting coffee and fruit in my room. I have clothing and laundry on the floor in my room and bathroom. I haven’t vacuumed my room in 5 months. I have garbage piling up in my bathroom. 

I get anxiety about going into my spaces because of the mess, but more anxiety about cleaning it and being judged while I do. It’s not logical, but mental illness isn’t logical either. 

Edit: I got the garbage picked up!",1753755636.0,2025-07-29 02:20:36+00:00,64,16,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbzknd/a_reminder_that_ocd_doesnt_mean_clean_and_tidy/
1mbzkg7,"I need advice, please.","To start off, I am extremely and unimaginably embarrassed with all of this but I don’t know what else to do.
Since I was 19/20 (almost 25 now) I got put on benzos by my doctor. It has been benzos but just different names, but same class. Over the years I’ve been taking them on and off but just recently I’ve been taking way too much and for the last few months I would run out, go through withdrawals, get them filled again, and it would start over. This has been going on since December of last year, and I started taking so much because of things that were going on in my life that my brain deemed horribly stressful so I’d take one, or two, or five. 
It’s gotten to the point that this month, the 18th was the last time I took any. The last time I took a few, I had a horrible panic attack. I told (not my regular doctor I was speaking to this one in place of my regular one due to him being on vacation) my doctor what happened and that the panic attack was so bad I would like to be SAFLEY taken off, or weened off of them. He instead put me on a different benzo, that was a lot higher mg. I took his advice and took them and had a panic attack after (about an hour after taking) that was probably one of the worst ones I’ve ever had being medicated. This was the 22nd of this month. I spoke with him again the day after and he told me he didn’t know what I was talking about when I said I wanted to be weened off of them and gave me nothing to help, since the 22nd I’ve been having horrible withdrawal symptoms and the one that’s freaking me out is my neck has been tensing up so bad it hurts to move and I can’t sleep, when I can fall asleep I get maybe about at most 4 hours. I’ve been disassociating so bad and I haven’t been able to shower or bathe in anyway because it freaks me out. I haven’t been able to eat without getting extremely nauseous and then eventually vomiting, the only thing I can kind of keep down is crackers. I don’t know what to do. I’m so embarrassed and I feel disgusting. My psoriasis is getting so irritated in my hair on my scalp and my hair is matted and seems to be falling out a lot. Due to me constantly going through the cycle of withdrawals for months on and off I’ve lost so much weight and I feel gross, I’m unrecognizable in the mirror to myself. I haven’t been intimate with my boyfriend due to me feeling disgusting and being disgusting and also being disgusted in myself. I’m scared of dissociating so bad I can’t do anything for myself cause I don’t know how long I’ll be stuck in it for. I literally don’t know what to do but I just want things to be better and to get better and to change. I’ve talked to my therapist about all of this, and he always changes the subject to diets? I want to be able to be okay and be able to be intimate and to be able to look at myself without sobbing and to not feel violently ill. If you have any advice, anything will help.

Is anyone else feeling the same way?

1mbz808,Just venting...hope this is the right place for it,"I was married for 24 years and some change when my ex revealed he was cheating on me and I found out later he'd been cheating for awhile.  Six months at least...maybe/probably more.

He made it out like it was my fault because of something that happened a decade or so before. When I was 35 years old, I got pregnant with a very much wanted second child who I lost around 10 weeks of pregnancy.  That understandably sent me into a tailspin of grief and loss thr took me a long time to get over. 

Ex told me during a fight while we were separated that the cheating was my fault. That I neglected him during the period after the miscarriage. That I wasn't strong enough to stop being selfish and put my own grief aside to focus on him and his needs. 

I was still taking care of our son ( who was 10 at the time), taking care of the household chores, laundry, cooking and caring for our elderly cat while also working part time while he worked full time plus over time and he was gone quite a bit with his volunteer work ( he was a volunteer with a group that worked alongside the local fire dept as well as a local volunteer search and rescue geoup). 

I was a good wife...the best wife I knew how to be...for 24 freaking years. I gave everything to him and he says it was MY fault he cheated because of what happened after the miscarriage?  I don't see how it was my fault but...idk anymore. 

I was raised to be a good woman. To give and give and sacrifice til it hurts then dig deep and find a way to just give more. Taking time for yourself was selfish and a good woman ( again...the way I was raised) is never selfish. 

I gave him everything...sacrificed everything for him...my time, my body and my money ( he thought I was financially irresponsible and I had to ask for money if i wanted/needed anything). For 24 freaking years I gave him...or thought I did...everything he wanted. And if I disagreed or voiced an opinion he didn't like, I was called stupid and mansplained to on why I was wrong.

I loved this man. I was dedicated. I was loyal. The idea of cheating never crossed my mind because good women...good wives...don't cheat. Right?

What did I do wrong to make him cheat? I wish I knew. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for whatever it is I did wrong to make him cheat.

I'm in a much healthier ( I feel like it is anyway) relationship now with a wonderful man who loves me very much. And I keep asking myself why he loves me when I'm clearly an awful partner if I couldn't make my ex stay loyal to me. I'm scared I'm gonna fuck this up too and I don't know if I could handle that. I love him ( my bf) so much. 

If yall made it this far, thanks for letting me get all of this out of my head. I appreciate it. Im just trying to process stuff that's been bothering me for awhile while I'm waiting for my bf to get home from work. I just...idk.

1mbyz81,Why do I feel so stupid when trying to improve myself?,"I struggle with quite severe treatment resistant depression and anxiety along with ADD. I’ve tried dozens of medications and a few therapists and nothing has worked. Everyone around me is trying to give me tips and help. They say I need to try and think positively, look for the good in things and have gratitude for what I do have. I’ve also heard a lot about meditation and deep breathing/mindfulness being a huge help.

My problem is that I literally can’t get myself to do these things. The second I try and meditate to calm myself down or try to show gratitude I end up getting more angry and just feel like an idiot the whole time. I also have developed pretty bad anger issues recently (probably due to my other mental health stuff) which has made it even harder. The voice in my head is just constantly screaming at me that this is pointless and I’m an idiot whenever I try and do anything positive.

It doesn’t just stop with me either. Now whenever someone else tries to help me in any way I get very angry at them. I’ve cut myself off from mostly everything bc of this bc I grew to despise them. It’s a big reason why therapy doesn’t really work for me either. I feel like they are talking down to me and nothing can make me shake that feeling. It’s like I’m allergic to positivity. I don’t know what to do about this.

TLDR: whenever I try and be positive or even just neutral I become angry and can stop thinking about how stupid I am. When meditating my inner monologue is screaming at me how pathetic and stupid I am.

1mbynhk,"Just gonna vent, read or don’t.","So for the longest time I’ve been not right in my head. Recently whatever is going on mentally has gotten worse. I’ve started telling myself I need therapy. At the same time however, I ask myself why I want therapy? I feel fine some days. Happy. Normal even. Some days though, I don’t even feel real. I have insomnia. I rarely sleep & can go days without sleeping if I choose. My brain never shuts up, I can’t turn it off to go to sleep like other people can. My days often feel like a dream, a haze. I’m constantly moving in slow motion & the world around me feels the same. I feel like I’m floating everyday. I feel like a ghost. I don’t want to feel like this. Some people find comfort in these things. I don’t. I don’t like attention, I don’t like asking for help. Part of me thinks I don’t need help, a part deep down does and is screaming at me to find someone who will. I’m the therapist friend. Yk. Always the saver, never the saved. I don’t believe anyone could ever understand me anyways. I always shut down. I want to explain everything, even the things I don’t know how to explain but I can’t. 

I’ve been diagnosed with severe high-functioning depression at seven. That I do know. I got diagnosed after my parents divorced. For context: My dad was an angry, abusive, alcoholic. That’s why my parents split. I’ve forgiven him now because he quit & got help for the sake of my brother and I. My mom however, is very emotionally absent. I can’t remember the last time I’ve gotten a hug from her, let alone told her how I’m feeling. I’ve heard more mean things from her than I ever have good, so I’ve never opened up to her. I’m the oldest daughter so that probably says a lot… I actually am terrified of disappointing her because I often do. I don’t ever want to go out either. I quit my first job a year ago before I even found another one. Big mistake. Now I’ve been jobless, alone with my thoughts. My only friend, since fifth grade, left me for a man and blamed me for the reason she stopped checking up on me, she’s just left me on read or replied with, “sorry I’m busy text you later.” So I stopped reaching out. They often say if you never messaged first who would reach out & truly I can’t think of one person who would think about me if I just stopped talking. I can’t cry anymore. Not a sad cry. When I’m sad I’m really just numb. Blank. I haven’t cried out of sadness for a long time. The only time I cry is out of frustration or stress which is all the time. Stress, lack of sleep, depression, no support. Not even parents who care enough to talk to me or take me seriously. Is changing me. My brain. I don’t think I’d ever hurt myself or someone else. My empathy is much stronger than my problems & I am grateful to be alive. I think getting the chance to experience life is a blessing. But I want a different one. A different reality. I’m constantly in a state of dissociation. One more thing is… in the past year, ever since I quit my job and lost my best friend, I started to create a new persona of myself. A shield. I don’t know what this means. But now I feel like there’s two of me. The first lie I told was my name. Then she became real. Evie. She doesn’t flinch when the world turns cold. She’s Someone softer. Someone lighter. She’s everything I wished I had the courage to be… I don’t know which voice to follow anymore. I have completely lost sight of who I am. I have no one and so much to get off of my chest. So If you read this all, thank you. Truly. :/

1mb8wfy,I can’t do it anymore,"I can’t do this anymore, I’m tired of everything. I’m 18 years old and have absolutely no motivation to pursue my dreams, it seems like too much effort to even take a step in that direction.

I’m 18 and have never been in a relationship longer than 5 months, I’ve never had sex, I’ve never had someone who was truly there for me. I have supporting parents but there love never seems enough and I always crave more  of it, I want a beautiful girl that will hug me and kiss me and tell me everything is going to be okay and that my problems are heard and valued I just want to be loved!!!! I’m going into my senior year of highschool and have no plans and no motivation on what to do when i graduate. I used to draw all the time and now I lose interest after a few minutes of doing it, I haven’t finished a piece of art in nearly 2 years and it sickens me, I want to draw but it seems more like a chore than anything else. All I do is play video games and work at my shitty job where I’m not valued as a person I know everyone there hates me but no one has the guts to admit it and sometimes I’d rather kill myself than work the rest of my shift. Every videogame I play if only enjoy if I’m winning, when I don’t win I lash out and get verbally and physically abusive towards my belongings, I’ve resorted to biting my controller as hard as I can to prevent me from breaking something else

Anytime anyone succeeds with anything I’m overwhelmed with anger and jealousy and I wish nothing but harm towards them and I often fantasize about harming them but I know I will never act on it

Im tired of feeling like this!I take medication but it’s never enough, I’ve resorted to taking nearly 3x my prescribed dose just to feel the effects and when it wears off I get even more agitated and aggressive.

1mb8dp5,I remember every mistake I’ve ever made,"Slightly dramatic, but I (28F) remember and beat myself up for everything I’ve ever done wrong. I remember the one time I ever got in trouble by a teacher for talking in class. I remember getting yelled at for asking my mom permission to sleep over a friend’s house before confirming with friend’s mother. I remember every time someone has scolded me in a customer service job. I remember accidentally letting my cat get out when I was walking my dog (he came back the next day but I still hate myself every day). I can’t stop thinking about my other cat getting sick and dying and I didn’t notice soon enough. Or the time I left my wallet at a coffee place in another state. The time in high school that I didn’t cut my wheel enough and slightly bumped my friend’s car and he didn’t even care. 

I also think about what-if’s and disasters I prevented but what if I didn’t. I think about my ex from 9 years ago almost giving our brand new puppy grapes and if I hadn’t been there to stop it, my dog wouldn’t be here today and I’m crying about it now just thinking about it. It ended okay and I still catastrophize it. 

I remember every time someone has called me ugly, fat, or worthless and the age I was when they said it. I spend my life constantly trying to think ten steps ahead and be perfect and never let anything bad happen. To never allow anyone a reason to correct me or criticize me. When I fail I want to kill myself and just start spiraling about all of the things. Everyone says how our mistakes make us the person we are today, but I hate myself so that’s not soothing. I’m frozen and incapable of being outgoing out of crippling fear of embarrassment and regret but I’m actually a really fun person that loves to laugh and sing and dance (oh how about the time I got drunk at a concert and was playing air guitar and people were all around me cheering? I cant help wondering if there’s some horrible video or photos of me out there).

1mbyflc,Paranoia Reassurance needed,"Hi! It's not much here and not very important, just a small request and vent i guess. I've been very paranoid lately, to the point where I feel like an anxious toddler again. Everything frightens me and I know this is just an episode like it already was before, but still. I'm on vacation with my family now. I had a whole heavy type a panic attack on board of the plane during a flight because I was sure we'll crash; I had obsessive thoughts as we landed and lived here for a bit which was my health anxiety speaking; and now I have a full force paranoia in our room. We spend the second night in here and both times I've had absolutely terrible nightmares that involve cults and all sorts of demonic creepy stuff I guess. I wake up in cold sweat. The first time I managed to stay still and fall asleep short after, but now I literally had to sit down and look around, and in the dark of the room I see things again. Like how I feel that there's a creature with black body and white face standing nearby. I know that this all ain't real, just objects, but it still hurts my sick mind. And being this high alerted my mind comes up with such amazing ideas as some hotel personnel walking in our room any time soon to harm us etc. I suppose it all sounds like a nothingburger and some child's yap, but I've been dealing with all these feelings for a long time, and I'm kinda sure it'll stick to me until I'm somehow better. So then, like, what do I do? How do I stop my paranoia? How do I stop being scared all the time and how do I stop my brain from imagining things? I don't wanna see this black body white face guy anymore, and I don't wanna see endless nightmares, and I don't wanna have panic attacks and bizarre ideas. My parents don't exactly get me, so when I'm trying to help myself they usually yell at me and tell me to stop. So is now. I'm not sure if anyone will see this anyway, but if someone does and by luck you've also dealt with this - could you please give me tips? And if anyone could give me simple reassurance - that'd be more than just appreciated!

Last year I began experiencing what I can best describe as “restless arms”? The closest feeling physically I can compare it to is when I had restless legs while pregnant. It’s a vibrating/ incessant need to move feeling in the muscles/nerves(?) of my hands and arms that is unbearable. It will suddenly come on it seems while I’m doing something that requires small hand movements (typing, writing, painting my nails) and sends me into a rage or sobbing breakdown because I can’t alleviate it no matter what. My physical reaction is to clench my fists and the muscles of my arms as hard as I can, when what I really want to do is punch through a wall just to get what it feels like is an excess of pent up energy or something in my arms. I have tried punching bags, working out, stretching, relaxation drinks such as magnesium, “devils lettuce” (I don’t know what I’m allowed to say here? 😂), I quit caffeine, warm baths and compresses, nerve relaxation lotion, I even quit my adderral for months in case it was the stimulant as a last resort(though it didn’t start when I started the adderal so I have no reason to believe that was it). I have broken things. I have screamed into a pillow. I have made myself bleed. Nothing helps. It prevents me from working because I can’t type. It ruins my day when all I want to do is paint my nails but I can’t, the instant I try to control it to apply polish I want to throw the polish across the room and scream. Typically what happens is I freak out and start sobbing because I feel so much rage that I know is not justified and I don’t know what else to do. And once my emotional outburst is complete the “issue” is gone. Maybe it’s unresolved emotional issues. If that’s the case it seems as if new anxiety medication would have helped. It didn’t. I have had a therapist for months. I have changed anxiety medications. Nothing. I have Xanax, nothing, it knocks me out cold so I no longer have to feel my arms but it doesn’t take away that feeling. 

Any ideas? ",1753749714.0,2025-07-29 00:41:54+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbxhh6/muscle_restlessness_causing_anxietyanger/
1mbxg3l,"Extreme anxiety and depression from boyfriend’s porn usage and taste in women, is there a path forward without breaking up?","31F and my BF M37 of almost two years and I keep struggling with this one recurring issue related to 1) my body insecurities and 2) his ocasional porn usage.
To keep it extremely short, I was flat when we met and found porn in his phone of big tit women, and also racially diverse searches. I am white/hispanic and petite and he had searches of everything but my type. This affected me greatly and I got breast augmentation, which helped my self esteem but I keep chasing perfection without end because my boobs will never look like big natural ones, which is what he likes.
On top of this for over a year he had mild erectile disfunction and I associated it with me being flat or different from his porn searches and not turning him on, until he opened up about past drug abuse and porn addiction. He went to the dr and now is on Viagra, which has helped greatly. He swears his ED had nothing to do with me as he finds me very attractive.
He significantly cut his porn use but when I leave for work trips he does it and it gives me severe anxiety.
He says he can stop it but I know he just says that and never will fully quit. I asked myself what’s my boundary? Once a months twice a year? Never? And I have a hard time finding the answer because no amount of porn he watches seems ok to me but also I recognize most men will use it so wi don’t want to be alone the rest of my life chasing the impossible task of finding a men that does not want porn and checks all the other boxes. My BF. Heck’s all the boxes but this one.

I feel constantly insufficient, even though he reassures me. I know what he likes now and cannot get it out of my head (the models he searched for, the porn searches of big tit blondes and big tit Indian and black girls) and I am absolutely haunted to the point I don’t know I can ever let go of it. I keep thinking these things he likes and everything in my day to day they remind me of it gives me triggers that put me in a terrible mental space. A tv show, a person walking across from us in the street, even his tattoos. I am tired of being miserable.

1mbwvll,"no motivations, stuck in the same loop for 5 years now","i dropped out in like 2020 and since then i’ve just been in the same loop of doing whatever for the last 5 years, playing games, messing with my phone, whatever. it’s very pathetic and i regret dropping out, im seeing everyone i went to school with go to college and making something of themselves while im just pretty much the same as i was when i was in HS, only difference is that mentally im doing worse. 

i’ve tried doing my ged, but even with that im stuck in a loop. been studying ONLY the language arts test for 3 years now on and off. at one point i felt i was more than ready to do it 2 years ago, but i slipped and went back into doing nothing. i feel so pathetic and like a waste. i have family that never finished high school that now struggle with money in their 40s and i really dont want to be like them, but even that isnt enough to get me motivated on the right path. i try my best to be disciplined, but when i do ever get steady on that i always slip off like 2 weeks later. im losing all hope for myself and starting to feel like everything i’ve done, which isnt much, is all worthless. 

i dont know what exactly i’m looking for in posting this, i dont think anyone here can really give advice since im just some random, but i just needed to let it out somehow. i had so many plans this year and its already more than halfway over and i havent accomplished a single thing. sure i OCCASIONALLY exercise and whatever but thats about it thats new for me this year. everything else is just the same old for the past 5 years. i dont want to waste my life away and waste all my 20s doing nothing. i’m almost 22 and i have nothing to show for it. 

another thing, i’ve had people ask me what i like to do and what my hobbies are but i can’t even answer that honestly, the things i do is just being lazy and i don’t think qualify as actual hobbies, and even if they were, i no longer find enjoyment in them anyways. everything just feels so meaningless now. i feel that even though i started my studying again it won’t amount to a single thing. no matter how hard i try

1mbwr9u,I suffer from wanting to be different,"I think I get upset whenever this happens.
I feel upset because there was a business startup idea about making certain t shirts . I went to work wearing a T-shirt that matched the ones I wanted to make…. Then my new friend surprised me with a visit to the office where she used to work too. She loved the t shirt but then she told me she wanted to start a business and make ones like it…
I felt very bad because I felt like it wasn’t so known in my friend group. This friend thinks a lot like me and she sometimes chooses / does the same stuff as me  , I think,  unintentionally…


She now thinks she found the idea of her dreams and wants to start it as soon as possible and I told her I’ve wanted to do it for a while and searched for a place where I can learn and she tells me she wants me to send it to her.

I’m upset because I needed to go and learn something I thought was new to me and my group. Part of me wanted to feel special and known for doing something unique in this particular group. But now she keeps sending me and it’s stuck in her mind.


I don’t know if it’s an issue with me or if it’s okay to sometimes feel like wanting to feel a bit special somewhere… 
I also wanted to keep myself busy since I lost mom not so long ago and wanted to be passionate about something again. 

I regret wearing the t shirt …

I don’t want to lose her and I don’t know how I can go now that she wants to go too. She may be mad at me if she finds out I go alone. 


I want her to forget about it. I saved privately videos about some tutorials and thought it was private but she clearly saw these videos (the app recommended them to her) 


I feel so guilty for wanting to be special and I want this . There’s nothing else that I want to do. I was going to be happy about it…. 

What should I do? Should I go to the workshop alone and learn how to do it? It’s a very unique type of manufacturing…. Or should I go with her? But she expressed what she wanted to do and it’s exactly the same style…. 

I sent her the workshop page and sent her an account that sold the shoes I was wearing  too since she liked them too
But then I deleted the workshop page as I felt hesitant and worried…. I hope she didn’t read the message when I sent it…I’m was unable to know if she read the message before I delete it or not… but I delete it anyway. I felt like she was confused a abit 


I wish she’d forget about the whole thing. 

I have no problem if other people wanted to do something similar since I didn’t invent them but I just don’t like it sines it’s someone from my friend group that wants to do it ",1753747697.0,2025-07-29 00:08:17+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwr9u/i_suffer_from_wanting_to_be_different/

1mbwicg,I don't want to continue with my therapist.,"(18 female)
Although she's just doing her job, she helped me a lot and did some favors for me, and I can't really stop feeling guilty for trying to stop going there.
As for why I'm feeling this way, I highly think that it's quite complicated and wrong, I stopped my antidepressants (SSRI 50g) even while I'm not supposed to, I was only met with better appetite and mood in general, but that didn't come out of the blue.
I go to therapy because of social anxiety, built up depression, panick attacks, suicidal thoughts and active self harm and I guess more according to the diagnosis (I actually started doing self harm seriously after taking medications, which I can't completely explain why).
The reason why I started therapy was my abusive father, it was a recommendation from some sort of, I don't know exactly since it's highly related to my mother's divorce and her rights as someone who's been abused. (Which makes it harder for me to just stop therapy like that)  
I had a fight with my mother, since I decided that I should visit my friend in order to feel better because stress was hunting me nonstop even when my mother said no but then I was only met with hurtful words and got my money taken away from me. (My mother is not a bad person she's stressed as much as I am but that doesn't justify her actions and it doesn't justify my actions too). 
I ended up running away and cutting my wrist, then I started acting stubborn and started trying to stop a car to take me to the hospital, but I looked terrible and everyone was visibly scared from me, it's just that I wanted to see my therapist at that moment, later on my mother dealed with it. 
And to be honest after everything I started feeling terrible for what I've done, especially showing to that large amount of people with such terrible scene, that's when I stopped my meds, because at the hospital they suggested hospitalizing me in a mental health hospital saying that I'm a direct threat for myself and others, that did hurt me so much and knowing that still hurts, it makes me feel scared and unheard, it makes me think that no one is willing to listen to how I truly feel even while I can be considered actively suicidal I still think that I didn't cross that line and still deserve to be met with understanding rather than fear, I know how societies work but I still can't just accept it personally. 
I don't want to continue with my therapist anymore because I know that I'm going to be met with strict procedures if I tell her my story and I just want to be met with peace and some support so I can deal with it all by myself, not to just feel helpless. Now I personally don't know exactly how am I supposed to feel, what am I supposed to think about or if I deserve a second chance with myself, now I think that continuing therapy will just make me feel terrible about myself even while I know that my therapist did everything to help me through these last months i believe that as long as I'm feeling distressed and uncomfortable continuing sessions I have the right to stop.
I already sent my therapist an email telling her that I'm doing good and tried my best to make sure that she knows that I'm not willing to pursue. 
I need advice because even with all of this I don't know what am I supposed to do exactly, I'm not feeling at ease after all, I'm afraid that I might doing something wrong, I'm still afraid and I can't help it.",1753747037.0,2025-07-28 23:57:17+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwicg/i_dont_want_to_continue_with_my_therapist/
1mbwhsc,nothing has felt okay for a decade,"trigger warning: thoughts of self-exit

Hi, this is my first time posting on Reddit. Forgive me if there is an issue with my format. I have tried to be open with others about my struggles however I feel that what I am going through is too much to fully dump onto my friends. To start, a bit about me. I have experienced mental health struggles since the age of 11, however I have never been formally diagnosed. I believe I was experiencing symptoms of either OCD or severe anxiety due to recurrent intrusive thoughts about my religion at the time. As I grew older, toxic friendships and the combination of heavy academics exacerbated my symptoms. I have always been extremely anxious, and sensitive. I attempted to go to therapy, however due to insurance I was only allowed one session a month, which was way too little. Then my therapist stopped contacting me and did not let me know why. This was when I was about 17. I have tried going to school counselors however did not feel that I could be completely open with them since I was at an academically rigorous school that was known to expel you if you showed that you needed ""too much support"". I have a lot of imposter syndrome, and low self esteem. I did not believe I deserved help for a long time but recently I cannot handle this anymore on my own. I constantly break down, wishing for death passively. I wish I would die, in a painless way because I am too cowardly. I lose sleep because of how intense the anxiety gets and no amount of me telling myself that things will be okay and that I am doing better than I think can soothe me. I feel foggy brained and unable to complete work tasks in a timely manner. It is beginning to affect my processing speed and memory. I wanted to ""deal with it on my own"" and tell myself all the time that my problems aren't bad enough to do anything about it. I am now about to start my senior year of college and I feel immense grief, that my life has never felt okay. I feel absolutely helpless and alone. I know other people go through things much worse than me, and I feel worse knowing that as it is something people have said to dismiss me. I often question myself on whether or not I have autism or ADHD (I have neurodivergent siblings). For the first time in my life I do not feel like I can keep masking my difficulties and pretend to be high functioning when I am not. Please, if anyone is going through the same it would help me greatly to know I am not alone. I feel like my anxiety and depression are eating me alive",1753746995.0,2025-07-28 23:56:35+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwhsc/nothing_has_felt_okay_for_a_decade/
1mbwahy,does being with someone every day worsen emotional dependency?,"hi everyone so basically i've struggled with emotional dependency since i was born basically, and i have this very platonic friend i've become emotional dependent on. the thing is: she's a really good friend and knows i struggle with this, i just don't think she knows that im emotionally dependent on her. this summer we wanted to do a lot of things together and we've been spending almost every minute together, if not in person then texting. what's the problem then, you ask? i get jealous of her relationship with a mutual friend of ours and every time the three of us hang out i feel hurt bc my mind makes me think she likes my other friend much more than me, and if i feel like i'm not the most special friend to her then i get into a depressive state and i spiral. it's weird because i only see her as a friend, and i don't know if spending this much time with her has made me more obsessive or more reassured and secured of our friendship. in one hand i feel loved and cared for when we're alone together, but on the other hand whenever we're in a group setting it feels like she doesn't like me as much as i like her, and that's just because she's interacting with people other than me. i know that's fine and normal but i have this instant reaction where my brain sends a panic alert to my whole body and i just feel really sick and anxious. another example is something she said the other day. she invited me to a hang out with her friend and friends of that friend that she didn't know. i said i didn't know if i was really in the mood but i'd think about it, and then told her to tell me where it was when she found out, because if it was close to my house maybe i'd show up. she ended up not going but before realizing she wasn't going she didn't tell me where it was, almost as if she didn't want me to come. and then what she said was ""oh remember that one hang out i told u about the other day that i ended up notgoing? well i got a bit disappointed that my friend cancelled bc i wanted to meet new people to vary"" and it was like she stabbed me. she always says that she really likes hanging out with me but she'd also like to hang out with other people, and i get that bc i feel the same way, but it really hurts because it feels like she doesn't like me enough. my fear is that spending all this time with her made me feel like this, but if i don't spend this much time with her she'll  get disappointed bc we're not doing anything and then summer becomes boring and also i love spending time with her and the feeling of being reassured in general. what do yall think? sorry if this was a bit confusing",1753746453.0,2025-07-28 23:47:33+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwahy/does_being_with_someone_every_day_worsen/

1mbw8lc,i stopped making an effort,"Maybe my mom was right that I’m being too lazy, and my friend is also right that I’m just uninterested in class. I keep putting off work *very* frequently and only doing them until last minute. I get sidetracked too easily—and the only way I could stay on track is if my friend is on top of work, which I then follow through. I guess that makes me dependent too if I had to rely on someone else. 

One of my earlier classes, the one in which I’m taking with a friend, my grade is pretty decent right now. If not better, the topics are easy to understand. Which makes it fun compared to other classes such as chemistry or physics. I guess professors are also a factor because my math professor right now is easy to follow along as opposed to my physics professor(I dropped out of that course because it wasn’t easy but she was also kind of difficult to interact with, not gonna lie). 

I’m not sure why I do this either. I’m close to failing my current class soon only because I’m unsatisfied with my work too, BUT I also just can’t seem to do it either. The progress may be perfect, but I fear that the final product is not as perfect in my eyes. So I just don’t do it (until I actually have to).

A previous class I also took together with physics was also rough. I think I did okay in the first two weeks until everyone was forced to take class at home for just one day. I got sidetracked and everything fell off ever since.

1mbw65u,Am I becoming a misogynist? Help!?,"So basically the story starts a few months prior, It would be a very long read but I made a post about it and you can read it if you want more context, but I'm giving you the short version here. I'm Indian but I don't look like the Indian you would Imagine in your head (a bit pale skin, light eyes). One of my friend's girlfriend dished out a tirade of racism against Indian men, unaware I was Indian, and guess what she's Indian herself. She's not apologized yet!

This has left me seething and I've now gone full psyop on twitter and reddit with women hating posts and most of my hate is centered around women, especially Indian! I'm getting flashbacks of all my interaction with Indian women and how they've treated me before and after knowing I was born and raised in India! (some of it might only be in my head TBH). And the recent uptake in Indian hate and constant attacks here in UK(and australia) has not helped my mental health!

It was alright till it was online, but now its spilling out into the real world! I've started giving a tough time to my friends and my throat and stomach just fills up with warmth, if I see a woman cracking even the slightest of joke at the expense of men (any man) whether it is offline or online!

I've gone to many subreddits and mostly people who have similar tendencies are frustrated due to their dating life, but that has not been the case with me as I used to regularly ask out women and at least score a date. I gave up later due to all of them failing or just turning into hookups and ghosting!

But this newfound hate is just towards Indian woman. I'm getting bombarded with misdeeds of Indian women on twitter lately and it just makes me seethe for a full minute! By seethe here I mean, I get annoyed and then give witty/borderlline derogatory answers to my co workers (mostly women and a lot of them are indian as well) which has led me to meet my senior once past week!

1mbw4ro,I'm 28 and alone for over 6 years and I can't bare it anymore,"I can't stand being alone anymore. I ALWAYS avoid eye contact when I feel like someone is really looking at me personally.

I think that's why I never feel close to other people, and that's what I mean by being alone.

I bet it sounds pretentious, but ironically, sometimes a lot of people look at me and smile nicely when I'm talking to a friend and laughing, for example.

So yes, I have a friend, and now you might think I'm not alone, but three months ago, he and others in a group of friends kicked me out because I felt I was being treated unfairly and ended up talking a little louder and more intimidatingly. I know it wasn't right, and I did it because I felt belittled all the time anyway, and I was depressed about it. Nevertheless, there is no question in my mind that I was treated that way at times, even if I handled it wrong. The friend I still hang out with apologized to me for it and said that kicking me out wasn't planned and that it was excessive, even though it looked very planned (everyone supposedly voted for me to leave).

That's why I still find it difficult because I wouldn't treat anyone like that as a friend.



I would love to have a girlfriend I feel comfortable with



I think that's possible because, ironically, I often get clear signals from girls that they see me that way too. I know that might be hard to believe, but it's true, and I almost feel like being alone for so long and somehow enduring it makes it attractive.

Nevertheless, I never try it, because I always want it to feel “right” for me, so I know that I can just react naturally without having to be afraid, so I intuively know that “something” will come of it.

As I said, I think that's possible, but it takes a really long time. On the other hand, it's also difficult to focus on it too much. I don't know what the right balance is, because I don't want to feel like I'm artificially creating something.

It just feels so weird when, on the one hand, I want to feel naturally connected to the person, which can only happen on its own, and at the same time I'm always analyzing “what's possible right now” in that moment (how I should act so that I “get” the girl). It's a contradiction.

1mbv9qu,My friend's girlfriend has been cheating on him for a year and he doesn't want to believe it,"Greetings to those reading. Before I begin, I will tell you in advance that the text will contain changed names to avoid loss of anonymity. 

I don't even know where to start first. Recently, rumors have started to appear in my social circle that my close friend's girlfriend is cheating on him with her ex. I am a person who tries not to believe in rumors floating among the Russian-speaking community (which is actually not very big), and not to continue spreading them without a good reason for me or evidence (photos, video, voice in extreme case). But this time the rumors started about my friend. 

Just a couple of days ago, sitting in a hookah bar I got a call from a mutual friend of ours, and asked me to urgently go into a group call, as the situation concerns my friend. Without suspecting anything, I go into this group call, where they start asking me questions, like (if you know he's being cheated on, why don't you tell him directly? I had to explain to the guys that I don't support this bullshit with rumors and other nonsense without solid evidence. They suggested that I call her ex and find out how it really was, as if he wanted to tell me everything because of the recent disagreement. I agreed. After fifteen minutes of conversation in my gallery I had several screenshots of correspondence between the girl and her ex, where she drunkenly begs him to come to her house and one photo of a racy nature. After a bit of thinking, I call my friend and ask: ""Buddy, is your girlfriend with you? He says he's lying next to him right now. I had to ask him to move away and to open a telegram, where I had already sent everything I had. I had to ask him to step back and send a telegram, where I had already sent everything I had. 

A few hours later, I tried to contact him to see what they had decided. Turns out my friend didn't want to believe what I texted him. At least in that correspondence. I didn't understand, but I decided to ask about the picture, and he told me that he forgave her and decided he could live with it. For what it's worth, I thought he was just afraid of losing her and that she wouldn't do it again.

It would seem that everything, we can finish the story. It would seem that everyone is happy, the friend has decided everything for himself and nothing else will change. But not in this case. I ran into this ex-boyfriend while grocery shopping today. We had a few words, and he asked, ""So what did your friend decide in the end?

I had to tell him that I hadn't made up my mind, that I'd left it at that. The guy's eyes popped out. And at that exact moment, he told me all the times she cheated on him. Not only did it start a year ago, it fucking lasted until the acquaintances mentioned in the beginning called. He showed me some more videos and pictures of them spending time together while she said she was sitting with her friends and no guys were with them. 

And eventually, I texted my friend again. Said I couldn't just forget what I'd learned today. Tomorrow morning he and his girlfriend are going to the sea in another part of the country. We agreed to go to a bar with him after his return and now I want to ask for reddit's opinion. What should I do in this situation? Should I leave things as they are and wait for her to break his heart or should I tell him the truth?

Ask any questions in the comments, I will try to answer them immediately. ",1753743781.0,2025-07-28 23:03:01+00:00,7,8,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbv9qu/my_friends_girlfriend_has_been_cheating_on_him/

1mbv1ek,Saw a comment that said “Self-blaming didn’t work? What have I been doing all my life then?”,"Someone left this comment under my post here, and here’s what actually does help over time:

✅ Name your inner critic. Literally give it a name. ""Oh, there goes Boss Julio again, yelling about how I’m worthless."" It helps you create distance and realize those thoughts aren’t you.

✅ Replace blame with curiosity. Instead of “Why am I like this?”, try “What might be going on under this reaction?” Curiosity invites compassion. 

✅ Practice self-talk out loud. Not in your head. Out loud, like you’re talking to a friend who’s struggling. You’ll hear how harsh you really are — and you’ll want to change your tone.

✅ Write letters to yourself from a kinder voice. You don’t have to believe it fully at first. But the act itself rewires how your brain relates to you.

✅ Treat guilt like a signal, not a truth. Guilt isn’t always accurate. It’s often just a leftover emotion from childhood where we took responsibility for things we couldn’t control.

1mbkhuy,What the hell man. Help haha!,"I honestly have so much to say for this to make sense but I don’t feel like writing it. Ive done that multiple times already. 

Long story short, Im 17, Im very depressed, I don’t like shit, I don’t go outside(great album), I have no friends, I’m insecure, Autistic and very very negative right now. I go to therapy and I have a good therapist. Been going a few years now. I will never have the guts to commit suicide but if I keep going the way I am right now, I’ll probably just rot away. And don’t bother with the ""Pick up a hobby"" or ""small steps, one at a time"". I’ve tried multiple hobbies but they never go my fucking way. Wanted to learn how to skate, became to insecure because some asshole mocked me for it. I bought a pc recently because Ive always liked games. Turns out, our house doesn’t have RCDs so I can’t even connect my pc to out outlets. It’s to expensive for my mom to fix right now so I just got this metal box on my desk now. Great.

Honestly I’m beyond desperate at this point for something. Just something. If you scroll down on my account, Ive been posting stuff like this occasionally since january 2024. Living like this sucks. I don’t have any guts to approach anyone at all and my brain has basically accepted this way of thinking so it’s almost impossible at this point to change my mind.

1mblqnc,Looking For Help,"-i'm not looking to diagnose myself or have the internet or someone over the internet diagnose me, this is harmful. I'm just looking to see if I fit anywhere-

So I'm diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression, Anxiety and PMDD. I'm also awaiting my Autism assessment though taking tests the doctors and mental health practitioners have given me, I've been told it's pretty much set in stone that I'll receive an autism diagnosis - I'm still processing this and it took me a while to come to terms with this.

However I just don't feel...right. I feel like I have something else going on and I don't know if one of my illnesses explains this or if it's something else I should look into with a mental health practitioner. Let me explain: 

My brain feels literally heavy (not a headache, no pain) and foggy, I feel like I can't visually focus on anything (I'm short sighted so wear glasses, but I have this problem with and without glasses). I feel like I'm always zoned out and not fully present, my mind wanders easily. I Maladaptive Daydream all the time, an unhealthy amount of time, and I can lose hours. 

I also have different personalities, like they're still kinda me but also kinda not. Here's a breakdown of them: 

There's Snow, she age regresses and loves kawaii things like Disney, Rilakkuma, Hello Kitty. She's sensitive and scared of anyone raising their voice, loud noises or anything that doesn't feel safe, cozy and colourful. Snow likes to wear Disney sweaters and collect toys like L.O.L dolls and Aphmau Meemeows. Her favourite colour is pastel pink. Snow loves the Spring.

There's Neon, they are non-binary. They love Cyberpunk, Neonpunk, Grunge aesthetics and dress accordingly. They hate wearing dresses and anything too 'girly'. They love gaming, collecting hotwheels, watching movies like Tokyo Drift and loves Formula 1. Neons favourite colour is neon green, they are obsessed with Suicide Squad and Cyberpunk Edgerunners. They love underground street racing, cars, trucks and doing mechanics & DIY. Neon is the dominant personality. Neon also hates summer, they love Winter/Spring/Autumn.

Then there's Lana, she loves anything trippy and hippy. She loves wearing John Lennon style sunglasses, heavily patterned harem pants and always wants her hair in locs (but after last time we are never loc-ing our hair again). Lana loves Spring/Summer. Lana is also the least dominant personality.

Each personality goes waaaaay deeper than the descriptions I gave, they all have their own hyperfixations, interests and style.

There could also be another personality but I've kinda just lumped it in with Neon and sometimes Lana as it could just be shared interests.

Here's the thing though, I don't go by any of these names, these are solely just in my head. In every day life I use my legal name and nothing else. But naming them in my head helps me keep tabs of all the things I got going on. I also don't refer to myself as we. I've tried explaining all of this to friends but it's just kinda ended up as a joke (we have a messed up sense of humour I guess).

Either way it's exhausting constantly feeling like a different person day to day, it can switch up during the day like for example I'll wake up feeling like Neon but by the afternoon I'm Snow.

Is this just me being stupid and naming my interests or is this something worth looking into? It's exhausting and I can't remember the last time I felt present in my life.",1753721959.0,2025-07-28 16:59:19+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mblqnc/looking_for_help/
1mbmpus,I lost the fire in me after High school!,"I was good in studies since my childhood, rather I was taught to be always perfect in studies, I used to be very ambitious and marks driven student till my 10th. During my high school also, I had the fire , that urge in me to take up the challenge thrown to me. I was made fun of my weight,I was so freaking determined that I lost 15 kgs in 1year. 
But the only thing which destroyed me was LOVE! 
I fell in love in my 12th, everyone says it was just a fling everyone has in their teens. But my emotions were raw and absolute for that boy. I had a ugly breakup after my 12th boards where he literally ghosted me without saying anything. I went into severe depression, loneliness, and overeating. 
On top of that I took a year drop for NEET which I couldn't crack for obvious reasons. 
After that things never got better, I always hoped thinking that everything changes for good but nothing happened. I got into a worse college, pursuing a worse degree, getting worse group of classmates and almost no friends. 
I always kept telling myself to get better but that urge I had, that ambitious nature waslost somewhere completely, even though I pushed myself in my mind many times but could do nothing in real.
Yes I got into another relationship with a guy but maybe I had become so much damaged till I reached him, This relationship is also not working and we go days without talking to each other.
College placement was none. Only 1 company came offering a nonsensical amount of money. 
Here I am sitting at home again preparing for govt exams, and everyday listening to the taunts of my father that he shouldn't have kept much expectations from me.
To everyone who have read this far , please tell where is my mistake that I am suffering so much? And what shall I do to improve my life again!?",1753724074.0,2025-07-28 17:34:34+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmpus/i_lost_the_fire_in_me_after_high_school/
1mbuy54,"My girlfriend just broke up with me, or it seems so.","So, she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship right now and said we should just be friends. She mentioned that maybe there could be a chance for us to be together again if she's ready in the future, but I'm not sure if I should believe that.

We had already planned our future together, even though we're just teenagers, and now she left me. We were only together for a month and a half, but she already meant everything to me, and now I don't even have anyone else to talk to. My family doesn't care, and I don't really have any friends. All I ever wanted was to be with her — that was my goal in life. Without that, my life feels meaningless.

I don't have any hobbies, I'm afraid to talk to people, and I don't even know what kind of job I want to have in the future. I don't have any goal to live for. She told me that I should find someone better than her who would care about me, but I don't want anyone else — I want her and only her, and it hurts so much.

I hate myself so much. I hate that I care too much about everything, even about people who’ve hurt me the most. I hate that my life is just an endless loop of nothing. I hate being ugly. I hate living in this fucked-up world. I hate that no one cares about me. I hate that I'm afraid to die, and yet I still want to. Why can't I just be perfect? I hate that I've done nothing wrong, and life keeps kicking me while I'm already down. Why does everyone hate me so much? I literally have no one anymore. I hate having mommy issues and struggling with them.

1mbp4sh,"So Lost at 32 — Depression, Burnout, Loneliness, and No Way Forward","TW: depression, suicidal ideation, emotional outbursts, animal harm

---

Hi all — I’m a 32M and I’m completely lost in life. I’m writing here hoping someone has been through something similar and has advice or even just perspective. I’ll try to give all the context I can.

---

1. Life feels impossible to manage

I look around and see others handling life: work, kids, relationships, hobbies, workouts, social events, and I genuinely don’t know how they do it. I am drained by work from Monday to Friday, on Saturdays I clean my home, get groceries, prep for the next week and on Sundays I crash in bed and do absolutely nothing to recover.

That’s it. No hobbies, no fun, just survival. It feels like I'm constantly running on fumes.

---

2. Financially and socially left behind

I didn’t get handouts like many peers — no flat, no car, no financial head start. Meanwhile, some of my friends have inherited property or live rent-free, have dual incomes, travel often, and build lives that feel miles away from mine. I’m stuck renting, with student loans, and no real savings. If I’m super strict, I get by. If I “live a little,” I risk debt.

---

3. My job pays okay but kills me mentally

In my work, I constantly have to fight with coworkers to follow rules. It’s exhausting to be the watchdog that nobody wants. I didn’t even choose this career — I just somehow ended up here. It’s not fulfilling, but I don’t know what else I’d even do. I would love to work with dogs, but see the issue with that below. 

---

4. Dating and loneliness

Dating has burned me out. Every time, I give too much and get little in return. Hence, I’ve become hyper-independent. I want someone, but I'm too tired to try anymore. Relationships feel like gambling — people pretend early on, and eventually it breaks, always. 

---

5. Depression, burnout and getting worse

I’ve been in therapy for 4 years. I’ve taken fluoxetine and bupropion. One therapist told me I may never stop taking antidepressants, because my brain doesn’t make “happy chemicals” naturally. Honestly? I believe her now.

Nothing brings pleasure anymore. Even basic joy feels like work. I stopped meds in February this year — I felt okay. But in May I went on holiday to a Mediterranean country with my then-partner. It was warm, beautiful, and for a moment, I remembered what it felt like to enjoy life.

Then we came back. Cold weather. Back to work. I spiraled hard. Eventually I broke up with my partner because I had nothing left to give.

---

6. Red flag moment

It got bad. Really bad. I noticed I became aggressive. I broke things. I used to reach breaking points before, but nothing to this extent. I swore constantly. Then one day my dog picked up something off the street — I lost it. I snapped. I hit him. In public. 

I don’t even remember how hard or how much. I just blacked out in rage. That terrified me and I realized: I’m not okay.

---

7. Where I am now

I’ve thought about suicide. A lot. I’ve made arrangements for my dog to be taken care of by an ex. I know he’d be better off with him. 

I’m not actively planning anything, but I’m getting close to that point. Life feels like a loop of suffering and pressure with no end, no joy, no purpose.

---

8. Has anyone been here and made it through?

What helped you when therapy and meds failed? 
How did you get out of burnout? What was the thing that allowed you to start caring again?

Thanks for everyone who reading this and replies. ",1753729385.0,2025-07-28 19:03:05+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbp4sh/so_lost_at_32_depression_burnout_loneliness_and/
1mbq03b,Suffering through emotional and educational neglect for 4 years,"I just turned 19 a few days ago. For awhile now, I haven’t been enrolled in high school due to educational neglect thanks to my parents. This year would have graduated. But thanks to my parents, I never started the 9th grade. 

I’ve been rotting in bed while I watch my older siblings excel, graduate, get jobs, get ID's, while no one bats an eye to my issues. Whenever I bring up these problems to my parents they either verbally attack me or try to justify how it's not their fault, even playing victim. They had plenty of opportunities to put me in online schooling but didn't, and I cannot get my GED or a job unless I have an ID and money to get an ID, which they neglect to give me too. 

And yet my older siblings, gets the opportunity to go out and socialize with their friends while I'm stuck at home lonely and miserable, never allowed to go outside because my parents see me as incompetent and a child. I feel like I'm perpetually 14 years old, without school or any work experience I never had the chance to properly grow. No one has ever taught me how to be an adult. 

I can't socialize with anyone anymore, I'm too scared to talk to the cashier at the store or family members, and I feel stupid (academically and socially). 

I'm so empty and I’ve had moments where I’d contemplate suicide—which is something I struggled with ever since I was 13, so it's nothing new, even though it's more insistent now. I hate it, I don't want to think about it but I can't help it. My situation feels so hopeless, even though I constantly try to reassure myself. It’s hard to stay positive. My parents have always shut me down whenever I struggled with depression and never took my mental health seriously, so they were not a proper source to vent these feelings to. 

I want to get away from my family, even if I have a good relationship with my siblings I don’t want to be with them and they don’t do enough for me. I feel bad for thinking this way, but I can't help but feel at ease whenever I fantasize living somewhere far from my family with someone who understands and sympathises with me. 

I have many other problems with my siblings and my identity, but I don't want to make this post longer than it has to be... 

Maybe I'm letting my circumstances control me? I hate feeling like the victim, I try really hard not to be so negative as I know that’ll only make me feel worse and less motivated to do anything—but I can't help it. What can I do in this situation? ",1753731333.0,2025-07-28 19:35:33+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbq03b/suffering_through_emotional_and_educational/
1mbqfwt,I (25M) feel emotionally stuck and isolated in my family — don’t know how to move forward [CW: suicide],"When I was 4–5, my dad >!took his own life!<. My mom had me at 35, and I have two older sisters (4 and 6 years older). My oldest sister took on a second-parent role and told me not to burden our mom, who was always stressed. My other sister bullied me emotionally. My mom is a chronic worrier who assumes the worst.

At the dining table, I rarely spoke. If I did, my comments were ignored, called boring, or corrected. Eventually I stopped trying. I felt different from other kids too — quieter, less confident, and like I didn’t belong. I hoped that would change in university.

At university I became more social, but it didn’t feel meaningful. I struggled with connecting because I’d built years of emotional defense mechanisms. On top of that, I chose a hard field, and when I started failing, my mom panicked. But instead of talking to me, she talked *about* me to others. It's as if she wanted to help me by asking others, but in the end it felt like she was the only one who felt better by doing so.

I’ve been living in a dorm since I was 21–22, but I’m home for the summer now. One night she showed up at my dorm during a LAN party and blew it out of proportion. I was gaming and trying to have fun connecting with people, but her behavior just kept isolating me more. I’ve also often felt like my mom and sisters had private conversations — possibly even about me — and excluded me from them entirely.

She once opened up about my dad. I shared a little about how I’d been feeling, and she got emotional, saying it made her feel like a bad mom. It wasn’t meant to guilt-trip me — she said other things too — but it made me afraid to be honest again.

My mom once told me it felt like I was “just renting a hotel room.” What I wish I could say is that it feels worse — like I don’t belong at all. But I feel stuck: stay silent and build resentment, or speak up and feel guilty.

The worst part is I know they want to be supportive — but everything they do sets me back. I understand it was hard for everyone in this non-standard family, and I don’t think they mean harm. But being around them brings back the worst in me — like I’m frozen in an anxious version of myself that wasn’t who I was meant to be.

All of this has turned me into a hypersensitive, anxious person. I know it’s partly my fault — for being too sensitive, not communicating better, lacking initiative, maybe even being paranoid. But that’s what happens when people don’t talk with you, only about you behind your back. I am to blame too, but I don’t know how to fix this.

When I was around 16, I told a close friend I thought I’d been depressed for a long time. He dismissed it entirely. He came from a totally different, very social world — but his reaction made me second-guess what I was feeling.

I do have friends now, but not many. I’ve pushed many people my age away — I couldn’t afford to be social or distracted after academic setbacks. I just couldn’t risk failing again.

I’m on track to finish my master next year, so that’s something. But emotionally, I feel lost and unseen. I don’t feel safe or seen at home. Some friends are in some way draining.

P.S. I have gone to therapy and may go again. He's the one that made me realize what I've gone through is emotional abuse. 
For the gymrats: yes, I go gym.

If anyone’s been through similar emotionally complicated family dynamics, I’d love to hear how you moved forward.

1mbqt34,I’m so sick of this BS,"This is gonna be very long and keep in mind I’m only 17 years old. I had to drop out of school because of some legal things.

the suicidal thoughts began because I was just discovering that I’ve been abused my everyone in my life and that there should be no reason as to why they are making me kneel on hard gravel while holding heavy objects for 6+ hours even if I had school the next day. Majority of my 3 grade year was spent taking care of my younger sister because my stepmom was working night shifts and my dad would rather let that baby sit in her own shit for hours screaming her head off then wake up out of his sleep and that’s when I realized he was a sick person. I started to do everything I could to get a way from him i spent majority of my teen hood in dirty clothes and I had to wear my underwear with no pad and just wash it over and over again because no one cared to but me pads and I hate that entire family which is why I avoid them. I notice that this is a pattern for people that want to help me “ out of the kindness of their heart”, first my mothers cousin she didn’t want me to be like her kids she wanted me to be a maid because when she was in Haiti at her mothers cousins house she was treated as a maid by her and her children so no one in her house is comfortable if she invites you to live there you’re gonna suffer. 

And now I live with my moms old friends girlfriend and he’s no better then my moms cousin this man is fucking narcissistic he had this obsession with his image of how much of a giving person he is but the minute you don’t listen to him or you criticize him about his behavior he looses his shot and just the other night he wanted to kick me out because I criticized his behavior and treatment of people in his family or social circle. When you really catch him in a corner on his BS he tries to shift blame at first he was saying oh I was putting thoughts into his girlfriends head when he was cheating on that lay for months and even got his mistress pregnant and then he wants to say that his girlfriend is the one that is among me disrespectful because she used my phone to cuss him out.n

I don’t think I can trust anyone this man threatened to beat me multiple times and if I wasn’t a minor I wouldn’t stay here or be under anyone’s control and I feel like my mom doesn’t care about me like sure she asks me how I am but everything boils down to money I come from an immigrant family so we send money back home and my mom is the only one sending and that shit is gonna kill her and sometimes I do want to commit suicide because my life is trash  and I just want to block everyone in my family I can’t do shit for myself with my money that I make because someone in Haiti is hoping for it to feed them and I get so angry that I can’t do things like get my hair done because I have to much sympathy. Every conversation we have leads to money “how much money am I making”, “did I get paid yet”, “when am I getting paid”, I can’t be a normal teen because this is what I have to deal with.

I talked to my mom a while ago and she said that he said he was gonna call her so idk and I told this man that my mom has enough on her shoulders and I feel like I’m the worst child a mother could have, I’ve smoked, gotten drunk how many got damn times and tried to commit  and nothing seems to work so I just like being left alone and people can’t respect that.

i kept trying to heal by myself but it felt at first good im someone who is good with fixing stuff really am a fixer kinda person so it was easy to catch on whats wrong and work on it and guess what.... it went VERY well at first! 

the way i viewed myself and life really improved i felt way better but as soon as i realized its something i am good at i kept diving deeper and deeper in places i shouldn't really go into alone

started subconsciously from healing to overanalizing myself in a terrible way like cycles and cycles of reasons to why i am fucked up and should fix myself so subconsciously dissociatied ALOT to the point i got a panic attack for almost a whole day

i stopped myself today retreated myself and told myself its okay and its hard and i can do it and everyone falls at mistakes its good that i recognized when i dived too deep before i actually got to drown but i started questioning my sanity and if i could trust myself with healing myself anymore dont know if i should stop for now till i get a therapist or continue

1mbuivv,Dark thoughts only when I sleep.,"I’m saying this is the most non concerning way, in simple terms 6 months ago had a shitty break up. Raised my exs kid as my own for 3 years since he was born. Fucked me up went to a dark place tried suicide. I’ve become extremely resilient in a way that I know exactly how to talk myself out of it. I have suffered a lot throughout my life with depression. I’m opinionated about the use of meds and honestly believe they may fix a person in hindsight create another problem on top of that. I won’t take them but anyway when you have battled with your head and your life so many times I’ve hit a point now where I know exactly what to do to avoid falling back down that low. I’ve learnt how to just move forward. I still question sometimes whether maybe I’m delusional and I’m just putting a Band-Aid on the problem and long term I’m fucked.

But anyway the last 2 weeks every night with out fail going to sleep I start thinking about killing myself. I know I won’t do it, but it replays over and over again until I fall asleep. No other time of the day just then. I’m at a point now where I’m bloody scared to go home to sleep because I don’t want to sit there for hours thinking that shit. So I sit at the beach.

But it has became a problem, now I’m starting to imagine my imaginary characters in real life. To the point where I can have full blown conversations to literally nothing. I now have no control of when I daydream and people have caught me talking/muttering/laughing to myself. These ‘people’ follow me wherever I go, as soon as I get bored I slip into a daydream where it tricks my mind into thinking they are in real life with me.

I feel like I lack a lot of emotions, a lot of people also said that to me. I barely feel anything, sadness, jealousy, envy, empathy. I don’t feel those. The most I feel is happy because it’s good for my mental health, I don’t care of someone is hurt by my words. I don’t feel guilt. And it has become a problem.

1mb21tx,I feel completely broken,"I’ve spent years feeling like I’m not enough. Like I don’t deserve love. I often feel like I’m too much—too loud, too emotional, too intense, too fat, too talkative—and not enough of what people expect to make someone lovable. I’m too difficult, too sensitive, too honest, too everything.

It’s not that I believe I’m worthless. I know I have value. But it feels like being exactly who I am means I’ll never be loved. That to be accepted, I’d need to become someone else entirely. Someone easier to handle. Someone quieter, lighter, more agreeable. Not me.

I’m 36, and I’ve only had one relationship that didn’t start on a dating app. It was a complete disaster. He was deeply broken, looking for a mother, not a partner. Six months in, he moved to another country and emotionally manipulated me into staying with him long-distance. It drained everything I had left.

I’ve waited for texts that never came, for plans that were never real, for people who were never truly present. I clung to crumbs of affection, just to feel visible for a moment. And slowly, that need made me disappear. I became lonely, depressed, surviving more than living. Most days, I do things alone. I live alone. I travel alone. I’ve even taken myself on dates. I’ve done all the “empowering” solo things. But honestly? None of it fills the hole of not being loved. It doesn’t ease the pain of not having someone to come home to. Of not being chosen.

I’ve been in therapy for years. I’ve taken meds. I’ve tried different professionals, read all the books, done every kind of inner work. But what I carry inside feels like a soul-deep emptiness, and I no longer know how to fix it. I don’t know what’s left to try.

Trigger warning: suicidal ideation and past attempt

I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for weeks. In November 2024, I attempted suicide. It wasn’t just a moment of weakness. It came from years of silent pain. From feeling invisible. From carrying the weight of being unwanted for too long. Sometimes I stop myself because I think of my mother, who recently begged me not to do anything that would destroy her. But the thoughts are still there.

I’ve lost more than I’ve gained in the last few years. One of the deepest wounds I carry is the relationship with my brother. After 30 years of being close, he cut me out completely. I still don’t fully understand why. My parents ask me to reconcile, but I can’t. He’s hurt me too many times, and I don’t feel safe with him anymore. That innocence I used to have—the belief that things could heal—it's gone. I don’t believe he’ll change. I’m tired of reopening wounds that never really heal.

I keep going back to dating apps. Not because I believe in them, but because I’m so deeply lonely that sometimes even fake attention feels better than none. I end up talking to people who don’t really see me, who play games, who disappear. It only reinforces my belief that there’s something wrong with me, even though deep down I know I’m not broken. I just want to be loved. Truly loved. Not for what I pretend to be. Not because I make someone’s life easier. But for who I am.

And honestly? I’m tired. Tired of giving love and never receiving it back. Tired of always being the one who survives, who tries, who rebuilds. Tired of not mattering to anyone in a way that feels real.",1753662320.0,2025-07-28 00:25:20+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb21tx/i_feel_completely_broken/

All my friends are in relationships and getting married. I hate it as well since I kinda currently have conflicting feelings for an online friend and I hate myself for it. I feel like such a creep and a weirdo and I’m so confused about what feelings I have. I would never do that to him tho and never go there since he a couple years younger than me. And whilst I do want relationships and stuff like that, i freak out if I get close and idk why. It’s like I get embarrassed with myself like “why are you in a relationship? You don’t deserve anyone. You’re a dork. Why would anyone like you? You’re an embarrassment and you shouldn’t be in a relationship.” It’s not them it’s me, and it was like that the few times I did get close ( a few years ago) to someone. I don’t go out either. I wish I did. It was my dream as a kid to go to theme parks or have sleep overs and stuff like that with a group of friends as a teen but I never did. I wish I was like all the other girls who go out and look pretty and get in relationships and have fun all the time. However I’m never invited. My whole life I was never invited. It was always for “close friends” and no matter how much I tried I would never be invited. I was always weird as well. I never got makeup or hair or fashion and focused more on tomboyish stuff like sports and movies and comics. I hate it. I hate me. I have diagnosed social and general anxiety and have since basically my whole life and recently depression. It’s gotten to the point that in the past few years (after a really crappy stressful job) I throw up nearly every time I go out whether that’s to restaurants, musicals/ concerts, or even if I need to do important stuff like appointments. It’s like my body goes into fight or flight and overreacts and makes me sick and now can’t even tell the difference between anxiety/nerves and excitement. I hate it and now I can’t go out without it ruining it. I am in therapy, read stoicism stuff and take meds and it’s like I’m ok with the “mind” stuff with anxiety but my body still reacts. I just wanna be normal. I wanna be like the other girls. I’m into “boyish” and geeky stuff and I’ll never look or act like the typical girl no matter how much I want to. I just wish I understood it ya know? Even if I try to do my hair or makeup or dress like them I suck and still look dorky or tomboyish no matter what or how hard I try.

1mb21m3,please can somone help.,"Hello. I\`m 24 years old, and having what some would call abit of a crisis at the moment, I want to reach out and see if I can get some better knowledge, and/or advice of how to deal with what im going through right now. I feel as if I am at my limit.

My mother was Diagnosed with a condition called ITP around 10 years ago now. it affects the plattelet count in your blood, causing bruising and bleeding as platlettes are (from what i understand) what thicken the blood. She has gone into remision with it and come out, it has nearly killed her countless times over the years with her platlett count dropping to 1 (the normal amount is around 150). There are various steroids and other medications that keep it at bay and help maintain a healthy platlett level. However, last year she became immune to the medication she was on, so they put her on another, and she became immune to that. She is now taking an injection, she takes it once a month I belive, but this is the last known treatment for this illness. With her age (54), and the vast amount of complications she has with it, I cant see how she will live another 3 years. 

At the same time as this, my sister has a multitude of health problems aswell. She suffered bad mental health issues growing up and into when she was about 25 (she is 27 now), through multiple suicide attempts, head banging, going into comas from overdosing. She then started having seizures, getting diagnosed with brain inflimation and EDL.  My mother struggled massivly mentaly aswell as she had to work as she was a single mum. Alot of keeping them sane and from exploding at eachother and themselves, was down to me, which does feel like it has taken its toll in many ways. Recently, her stomach has become paralized and she cannot keep food down, not only that but it is leaking stomach acid into her body which is getting filtered to her brain causing her to loose all her periphireal vision, mentaly they are both amazing now, which is why its even harder that their pysical health is failing.

I\`m a chef so I work long grafty hours, I thought I had a good system of dealing with my trauma, seeing the possitives that come from it, appriciating the little things in life, underastanding that its nobodys fault and that things might get better. This naive view has crumbled now.

I just feel so sad. neither of them are officialy dying, yet I feel as if they are. I dont know if im even justified to be feeling this way, but at the same time whenever my mothers plattelets drop bellow 5, which is around twice to three times a month now, there is a good chance she wont come out again.

Im so sick and tired of turning to hope. Its what you turn to when all the evidence suggests otherwise. Hoping things get better for them to only get worse kills my soul, despite the fact I have clung onto it for what feels like forever now. I feel I have to be strong like I have always been for them, but I just can\`t anymore, and that feeling is scaring me now. I saved some money and Im handing in my notice soon for work, as I want to take time to spend with them and try and get my mental state back to a normal place. I cant stop crying, I want to isolate myself from my friends and almost relish in the sadness of it, which I feel ashamed to admit.

1mb0t4m,What do do if I struggle with the problem of right of identification?,"Well, I struggle with answering the question ""what is your ethnicity"" because if we judge of it by my first language and surname, I feel like they were imposed onto me, or I don't associate them with a culture. People of my own ethnicity often tell me that I probably originate somewhere else or that I am weird. I do feel better in certain other ethnic groups, with whom I even share more cultural views and opinions than with my own.
I know my family history, and moreso, I know that the language I use, and religion were adopted by us because of political reasons(now on the opposite it is very bad to be of my ethnicity because it is being seen negatively but honestly I don't want to die on that hill).
Nonetheless I still don't associate with my family. I say that for me the family is who I care about, where I feel that I belong inside, an inner affliation. 

And when people ask me where I am from, I do not want to be associated with my father or language, or surname. How can one act in this situation? I just wish I had rights to belong where I want. Psychologists and people go like ""Accept your origin"" and I start to go into metaphysics, saying that my origin is not just origin of my physical composition. All of this imposed identity, the family I was born into, everything, must be some kind of a plot.  I do not want to accept what life imposed onto me.

1mazy71,I don't want to be a person I wish I could be a robot lol,"To start off I am EXTREMELY autistic along with having a multitude of physical and mental disabilities that make it hard to live. Just a bit of background.

I constantly get overwhelmed by every task given to me. I need to do laundry? Hard but that's fine. Oh but I also need to do dishes? Okay so I should just end it all. If I'm given more than one thing to do I break down and can't function, I can't even do my original task.

I try to explain this to my family members who are also autistic and yada yada hoping they'll understand but they never really do. They try to support me but in the end it's just ""you have to do it."" Which makes me really frustrated because like....I could just kill myself instead? The only reason I haven't yet is because I would feel guilty and I'm honestly scared of what happens after death.

I don't want to do people things, they're exhausting. I don't want to work, I don't want to clean, I don't want to eat, I don't want to talk. I want to not exist the way humans do.

I've realized I really like robot characters. Think Glados, AM, the likes. Dr House is also in there too but he's not a robot I just thought it might be funny to mention him. A couple months back I told my family and they asked why, which I couldn't answer at the time. I realize now it's because of how they act. They're the embodiment of everything I wish I could be. Hard, cold, and metallic. Uncaring sometimes. They don't need the approval of others. They cant do whatever they want, they are the god of their domain. If someone disobeys they can just hurt them. They don't have to worry about being liked. And most importantly robots don't really have to worry about keeping themselves alive- a lot of fictional robots just survive off some unnamed power source. 

They don't feel pain the way humans do either. My joints would never hurt. My back wouldn't kill me in the morning. Hell I wouldn't be ""depressed"" it would be some other fancy word for hating humans. But I cant be like that, I'm not like that. I have to get a job and keep up appearances and care about people and care about myself so I don't end up homeless. That's what they always tell me ""you'll end up homeless if you don't get a job"" Then I'll kill myself how hard is it to understand that?

Why do I have to be a person? Why can't I be a cool fictional robot who controls some evil and fucked up facility? Even if the hero would kill me in the end I would enjoy tormenting them. Why do I have to be real???",1753656476.0,2025-07-27 22:47:56+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mazy71/i_dont_want_to_be_a_person_i_wish_i_could_be_a/

I have a very strong habit of getting stuck in a negative mindset and staying there. This summer I had to move away from everyone for the summer, and I’ve struggled the most. I now realize that I have this issue, and am looking for any advice on how to help it. One thing I want to find is an app that will encourage me to write a positive thing down every day, but I want it to go off at different times.

1mbtvpa,My 14 yo brother keeps on having terrifying panic attacks because of his fear of death,"I am desperate, that's why I'm here. My family is poor, we don't have any finances to afford a therapist for my brother. And it seems I'm the only one who's truly concerned and trying to take some action, because their methods aren't working. They're trying to use psychology, when it's clearly a psychiatry case.

It all started, I think, very early in his age, probably before he was even 10 years old. I would boldly state that I am pretty sure my brother has death-related OCD or thanatophobia.

The symptoms that I can identify:
1. It started with his obsession with his health. He has a weird fear of showing his belly button to anyone because once he thought it was dirty and then just became overly obsessed with it. Our family laughed it off and just considered it a little odd, when only now I realize it's more than just a weird obsession.
2. As a kid, he would cry some nights and tell us he was scared of death. Very openly, but it wouldn't happen very often. Interestingly, I remember myself being a kid and feeling the same way, though when I'd become a teen I would be obsessed with horror movies and all the gore stuff and be as snug as a bug in a rug after. It's still weird how we're total opposites, both are obsessed with death in very different ways. I love criminology and forensic science and I consume the information that most folks find terrifying daily and feel just fine and unbothered.
3. We would never tell him anything about his health because he becomes so anxious about it. He would then ask many questions, randomly bring it up, cry over it. Even though he never had serious issues.
4. As a teen, he became a gaming addict. He would spend days and nights playing games. He never hangs out with his friends outside, tho he does have online friends. He doesn't do any kind of sport. He is always here playing games. And it intensified with the attacks that he started to have more seriously.
5. He would yell at me to shut up whenever I would talk about death. And not just death, but ANYTHING that is about human body and its vulnerability (?).
6. He ONLY sleeps with the bedside light on.
7. I'll describe his episodes. They happen every single night once or twice. Sometimes three times. I never saw it, but I hear it every time. He screams out of nowhere, sounds like he's in agony. Then he throws his pillow somewhere and my grandma rushes in his room. He then proceeds to calm down very quickly. But he can never sleep well.

To me it seems that he uses gaming as his personal compulsion. Even he told me himself, ""I play games so I'm not thinking about death"".

What do y'all think? What can be done to prevent it? Is his mental state dangerous to him or our family? Do you think he is able to harm anyone in this erratic state?

Anything would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

P. S. My grandma is also beyond anxious. She has insomnia overthinking every night. And now my brother having these attacks is only making her state even worse. I also suppose I have an anxiety-related disorder. I can never make mistakes, I'm a perfectionist to the core and I will push my limits to get to a point where I feel worthy. Sometimes it seems we all are insane in the same way, just basically have various types of the same disease.",1753740282.0,2025-07-28 22:04:42+00:00,1,3,mentalhealth,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbtvpa/my_14_yo_brother_keeps_on_having_terrifying_panic/
1mbtt3c,I wanted to just talk about 3 times I was depressed. Don't mean to bring anyone down. Just no friends to talk with.,"I remember I used to watch even Stevens on Disney channel and it made me feel like I had friends. Like I had a social circle. I was very much an outcast in middle school. Bullied because I was bigger and taller for no reason. 


Right after high school I had a falling out with some people I thought we were friends but were working against me behind my back. I remember staying up all night watching a cheers marathon and halfway crying pretending I was there where everyone knows my name. Sounds pathetic right? 

Then my childhood hero, someone I luckily got to meet several times JDF Tommy the green ranger etc. Passes in the worst way. It broke my heart. I laid back in bed pulled the covers up and remember staring out the window. I want moving and my wife and kids just thought I was asleep. I began to have a real bad F*** it attitude. My health has declined. I'm trying to myself out. 

I have no adult friends besides some that are states away. I sometimes feel so stupid for letting bad people make me think they were my friend. I've been tricked and used repeatedly. Lost jobs for ridiculous reasons and left with dreams that are just dreams. 

I'm currently counting calories and seeing doctors to correct my health and I love my kids and wife so damn much. They are the best part of my life. I just get bummed when I dont have friends to hangout with sometimes like the good ole days.

1mbtso4,I am no longer a human being,"So, about a year ago I started watching Tik Tok videos and basically every celebrity was speaking to me through my phone. Now, I’m a complete robot…every emotion I feel is now controlled by another person, I feel no internal joy based off of what I do from my free will. Everything I do is quite frankly, forced, fake, and just emotionless. I really don’t know why I’m typing this, it’s a cry for help I guess but I know nothing will change. Elon Musk has gained complete control over my body, mind, and now absent soul due to him. I never knew someone could be so evil as to actually play God and take someone’s free will away like this. I hangout with people to not hear Elon Musk, I don’t connect with anyone because you have to naturally FEEL a connection with them, I don’t feel internal joy unless Elon GIVES IT TO ME. The give of this situation is NOWHERE NEAR the take from this…..no emotion I feel is from my internal being, it’s given to me by Elon Musk…the psychopaths even make a joke about this saying “I guess we can give him this” in terms of emotion and things like that. Do you all understand this? This is an undeniable truth, I SAW CELEBRITIES SPEAK TO ME THRU MY PHONE FOR DAYSSSSS… other people don’t hear voices saying “oh well we’re going to take your nervous system away or your brain power away” and then it’s ACTUALLY TAKEN AWAY…..it’s just mesmerizing how every single human abides by this at this point but I get it because them telling me the truth would just make it worse. I truly don’t feel joy in my life and thus, I hate my life….every emotion is GIVEN TO ME… how or why WOULD I FEEL ANY PRIDE in myself when EVERY. SINGLE. EMOTION. Is not natural. My God I miss drugs, it’s a major step up from this hell I live in. And Elon will continue thinking this is cute….its all just a game to him and that’s it CUTE…being a literal demon is just cute to him….and no one does ANYTHING about it.

1mbsqrq,I live in a constant state of derealization — but sometimes I catch a glimpse of the world as it “should” be,"Hi everyone,  
I’ve been struggling with chronic derealization for many years now. Most of the time, it feels like I'm looking at the world through foggy glass — everything feels distant, dreamlike, and not quite real. I function, but it’s like I’m detached from life, like I’m watching it from the outside.

But occasionally, usually just after I wake up, I get these short, vivid moments where everything looks incredibly clear and beautiful. I look at my hands or the room around me and it feels like I’m truly *here* for once — present, alive, and connected. It feels so intense and real that I almost want to cry. Like I’m seeing the world the way I used to as a kid. Nothing feels fake in those moments — just raw, bright, and real. It only lasts a few seconds or minutes, but I can’t stop thinking about it afterwards.

I think I used to see the world like that all the time when I was little. But something changed when I was 14. I had to be hospitalized with peritonitis, and because of the infection and the stress, I had really bad hallucinations and trauma. After that, I had nightmares for months, kept waking up thinking I was trapped in the Matrix or losing my mind. It was terrifying. The intense fear eventually faded, but ever since then, it feels like a part of me disconnected. That vivid perception never fully came back.

Now I’m not even sure what “normal” perception is anymore. The derealization feels like my baseline. I don’t know if what I feel now is trauma-related, dissociation, or something else entirely.

Has anyone else experienced something like this — where the world sometimes suddenly feels real and vivid, but most of the time it’s flat and distant? Is this just chronic DP/DR? Can it heal?

1mbsf72,"I feel like something is wrong with me emotionally, but I’m not sure if it’s normal or should I seek help? Is this normal teenage things or?","I’m 17F and I’ve been struggling with how I handle my emotions. I don’t really know what’s “normal” and what’s not, but I’ve been feeling like the way I react to things is not normal, mainly bc I’ve never met someone who is like me. I’m not self-diagnosing, I just want to know if this sounds like something worth looking into.

Here’s what I’ve noticed:
	•	My moods change very quickly and usually depend on how someone treats me or what they say. A bit of background: it feels like someone is always mad at me for something I did or didn’t do. I live in a place where a lot of people my age know each other, so rumors or comments about me get back to me through friends. When I hear what people I don’t even know say about me, it ruins my mood and makes me want to confront them. If it’s something stupid, I usually just rant and let it go. Also, I can’t stand my mom, every conversation with her stresses me out and irritates me, though the feeling goes away pretty quickly afterward.

	•	When I think someone might leave or pull away from me, I panic. There was this guy I only knew for a month, I wasn’t romantically into him, but I desperately wanted him to stay in my life. When he pulled away, I texted him over and over, begging him not to leave. Till this day, I still think about him and sometimes want to reach out, ask if he’s happy, or doing ok. He was mentally in a bad place, and I thought I could help him, but when we got closer, he ran away because he was scared to get attached. I don’t meet many people I feel that strongly about, and I’m young, so I don’t know if that’s normal.

	•	I have intense verbal outbursts, especially with my boyfriend I’ll have a full mental breakdown and cry and yell. Most of the time it’s not his fault. it’s really about things I wanted to say to someone else but couldn’t. Even after I let it out on him, I still think about what I wanted to say and can’t move on. I just want to get it out, no matter the consequences. Usually these things I want to say are confrontational, mean, or spiteful, but they feel necessary. When I can’t say them, it’s like my skin itches.

	•	At night, I sometimes feel empty and think about running away or even how I’d die if I wanted to. I would never act on it, but those thoughts are there. I then just go to sleep, it takes a while to fall asleep and it’s usually not even a good sleep. Is this like normal night time low serotonin low mood and stuff or something. 

	•	I’ve been told (and I know) that I’m “too much” sometimes. My boyfriend often says I’m being dramatic, and maybe I am, I probably am, but I can’t help it, I just need to confront yell or do something to someone. Sometimes i over explain things a lot, i just don’t think anyone understands me.

	•	The only person I feel somewhat safe with emotionally is my boyfriend, but even with him I try to hold back because I know it’s a lot to handle. 

Does this sound like something I should bring up to a professional? Or could it just be normal teenage emotions that I need to work through on my own? Part of me feels like if I had a diagnosis, it would make me feel better because at least then I’d know what I’m dealing with. I’d rather something really be wrong with me than just me being me, I wouldn’t want to be me. My impulses has affected my relationships with ppl around me and my days and my mood I guess. 

Any advice or insight would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading.",1753736826.0,2025-07-28 21:07:06+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbsf72/i_feel_like_something_is_wrong_with_me/

1mbrr0d,Has anyone successfully committed a loved one during a psychotic break? I’m desperate for guidance and words of encouragement.,"This is my second post about my brother (36M), and I’m growing more desperate. His behavior is increasingly erratic and delusional, and I genuinely believe he needs psychiatric help before something truly dangerous happens. Waiting it out is not working, and I’m terrified.

I’m hoping someone can guide me through the process of getting him placed on an involuntary hold or offer advice, encouragement, or personal experiences. I’d like to not feel so alone in this.

***Background:***

Two weeks ago, he began claiming he was drinking “bone marrow from ancient giants” (actually a vitamin powder), fasting because “the government is poisoning food,” and ranting about celebrities trafficking children through McDonald’s burgers. He believes vampires, demons, and conspiracies are real.

On 7/20, he came to my house at 2:30am demanding we purify spring water with crystals. He said he met a time traveler with a magical staff and traveled through seven dimensions. His delusions have shifted from spiritual to extreme Christian interpretations—he now believes God is revealing apocalyptic secrets.

The next day, my dad (who lives with him) said my brother lost his phone and wallet, later found over a mile away. He returned soaked, saying my dog chased away Hell Hounds. A neighbor saw him screaming at the dog to flee from demons. He now insists the dog is a human soul trapped in a dog’s body.

His symptoms worsen at night: he claims he moves the sun and moon, hears six voices, talks to God, and can make people disappear.

Yesterday, he forcibly took my gemstone collection (worth $500+), including pieces gifted from deceased loved ones, saying they were cursed and tried to burn them. When my dad intervened, my brother punched him and broke his glasses.

He believes my son (6) has a demon inside him and that my ""crystals"" (my gemstones I use to make jewlery and just use as decor), tarot cards (which were given to me by a deceased friend, I have never played with them or used them), and his ex-gf’s alleged curse have brought darkness into our home. He insists the world will end next Wednesday and that he will “come get us,” but we must leave everything behind. He swears he is not crazy, just awakened. I do not want to wait til then and see what happens when the world doesn't end or see if thinks it does.

He’s been sober for 10 years. I’m 7 years sober myself. Our dad searched the house and his truck, no paraphernalia. This doesn’t appear drug-related.

**Colorado Law:**

Under C.R.S. 27-65-105, someone can be placed on a 72-hour emergency psychiatric hold (M-1 hold) if they're a danger to themselves or others due to a mental health crisis. This can be initiated by law enforcement, a licensed physician, or a qualified mental health professional.

If more treatment is needed, C.R.S. 27-65-109 allows for short-term involuntary commitment, but that requires a court order and evidence of grave disability or continued danger.

**What I'm asking for:**

* Advice on how to initiate an M-1 hold safely
* What documentation or evidence helps
* Legal insights into protecting ourselves and ensuring his care
* Personal experiences: what helped, what didn’t
* Words of encouragement

I’ve contacted NAMI and gotten some guidance. But I’m scared. He has one of my dogs, knows my house codes (I don’t know how to change them!), has already hurt my dad, and can get very violent. I love him, but I need to protect my family.",1753735287.0,2025-07-28 20:41:27+00:00,2,5,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbrr0d/has_anyone_successfully_committed_a_loved_one/

I feel like such an outcast from the group. I don’t want to be me anymore. I keep having suicidal thoughts and feel I am getting closer to it. I’ve tried to talk to people at home but my sibling is very high achieving (they play sports for England while requiring extra attention acedemically for dyslexia) while I am average and have gotten more judgement then help.

My friends all say it'll happen one day and I'll find the one but yet at only 16 I feel like I shall live the rest of my life alone (when it comes to love), it also doesn't help that I over think everything about the person I like (mostly how they'd react if and when I confessed my feelings to them).

1mbqx1e,It never gets better no matter what I do,"No matter what I do, my life hasn't gotten better. In middle school I lost all of my friends and became depressed since then I have been so miserable. I am turning 19 soon, and I know I am young, but seven years of unhappiness with no sign that things are getting better will drag you down. I wasted my youth. No friends, no enjoyment in school, no accomplishments, being invisible to everyone, no girlfriend, trying and failing. I haven't just sat around and done nothing either. I have tried so much. I've joined clubs in school and out, had two long term jobs, tried three natural antidepressants, gone outside and tried to be active, switched schools, spent tons of time with family, gone to hobby spaces to meet people, lost weight and improved my appearance, tried to make a major life change, and I even started therapy a few months ago. It doesnt change anything.

I know people like being around me but I am incapable of forming deep relationships. I don't fit in with people bc Im weird and haven't developed the way they do. I'm in fucking community college doing random classes because I have no direction despite graduating hs with a 3.9 and knowing I could do something great if I had the motivation. I go to therapy and have nothing to talk about because really I don't do much and nothing I do really matters, and it ends up just being a stressful embarrassing waste of time and money. I don't know what else to do. I feel like I have done everything I am supposed to and it has all failed.

I am going to buy a gun soon (completely legal and easy in my state). I feel so fucking bad for my family. But god there is nothing else for me to do. They don't get it. I'll try and make it easy on them but I can't stay for them. I have tried so much and it all failed. For almost seven years I have been telling myself that it will get better, if I just keep trying then it will get better and I can be happy again. At this point my idea of being happy is based on vague memories of when I was eleven. I don't know what to do. There is nothing left for me to do.

1mbqmgm,Apathy and emptiness with depression. Nobody around me seems to fully grasp it.,"I'm just tired of trying to explain this to people. People that either don't listen, don't understand, or assume that the problem is as easy as flicking a light switch. 

It's not just that my hobbies aren't fun or interesting anymore, though almost all of them aren't. I haven't washed my hair in days. I think I get two or three hours of sleep on average. 

I keep getting asked to hang out with friends, and I keep having to politely decline because I can't bring myself to do anything. If I force myself to do things, I only end up hating those things. 

Video games aren't fun. Crochet isn't fun. Art isn't fun. Studying isn't fun. And if I didn't work at a grocery store, and I had to actually plan trips to buy food, I'm convinced that I simply wouldn't eat most of the time.

I'm always tired - due in part to my lack of sleep. But even when I've rested for a full six to eight hours, I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to do anything major. 

I don't care about things that I should care about. I get genuinely annoyed by most things now. 
So many games on my computer. So many art projects that I should probably finish. Plenty of crochet tutorials that I would just love to throw myself into. So many new recipes to try. But I'll start doing any of these things, get a few minutes into whatever it is, get distracted or start feeling miserable, have one of those moments of ""what's the point anymore?"", and then give up. Every time. Without fail. 

I don't think I've completed a personal project in months now, and even though I can get my tasks done at work quickly and efficiently, I'm back to being an unhappy, useless bag of rocks when I'm home. 

But I'm not choosing any of this, and if I am, I'm not aware of it. So to hear one of my friends constantly sound almost inconvenienced by this has kind of hurt. Having them go "" please go take a shower, 'for me'?"" a few times has made me resent them a little. Hearing that I should just do things and push through even if I don't enjoy them just sounds foolish. Because I'll *definitely* enjoy hanging out with my friends or cooking or making art whatever if I force myself to do it. This is the same friend that's said things like ""cheer up"" or ""calm down"" in the past in some pretty inappropriate situations, so my opinion of their methods might be a bit biased. 

It's not just this one person. My parents have never accepted depression as a real problem, even when they catch me staring into space for way too long, not eating for a day or two, or  only leaving my room for work. 

I don't know how best to explain this. It's frustrating to know that there's something wrong with my head, but I can't make people see what I see or feel what I feel. I don't want people to suffer, but I just don't want to be seen as either a lazy liar or some fragile, sickly thing that they have to walk on eggshells around. 

I am not okay. I haven't been in years. And 2025 has been genuine hell for plenty of people, not just me. So why is it so difficult to believe that maybe I'm not slowly sabotaging  my life and pushing away friends on purpose? I can't keep apologizing and trying to force myself to act normal when something inside of me is so fundementally ruined. It doesn't feel like I'll ever be okay sometimes.

1mbqgfw,Have you ever felt frustrated by an impossible or unrequited love?,"Hello, I’m David, I’m 24 years old, and I would like to tell you a little about an unrequited love I had with an old friend. Two years ago I met online a boy from Spain named Miguel Ángel, I’m from Mexico. At first he seemed to me something intense that I thought he wanted him to be his partner or something like that, but as the days went by I began to like him a lot, since we could talk openly about whatever it was without getting uncomfortable, or even talk as if we were boomers. What I liked about him was his beautiful heart, his positive way, his desire to improve himself, his humility, that he was someone who did not always capture my attention because I almost never notice anyone.

I really liked talking to him, it seems that from the beginning he captivated me with his person. The only bad thing there was that he didn’t fall in love with me, but with another guy who had no other skill or talent than to show the meats online and that after the days of formalizing his relationship the guy left him two days after that.

At some point he told him what he felt for him, but he was not having a good time because he began to have emotional problems during an Erasmus in Belgium, after that his ex left him. In addition, he was not interested in those long-distance relationships, although if it had been the opposite, I would have been encouraged to be his partner like that. Previously I had moved away from him because I felt that he no longer cared about being my friend in part, until one day I apologized to him and he also apologized to me. That was nice. From there she told me everything she was going through and that she was having a hard time.

Months later, like in February 2024, I told him that I was interested and well he said not because of everything that was happening and that I was trying to overcome and days later I walked away from him again. In addition, when you declare yourself to a friend you feel that the friendship will no longer be the same.

It seems that I still miss him or that I still like him, I don’t know. Although a long time ago I decided to release something that damaged me and that could not be in reality, there are days where I get nostalgic when I remember everything I lived with him as friends or that my feelings for him were obvious when I flirted or flattered with him. For my part, I recognize that in the end I acted badly without saying things as they should be and I ended up leaving without saying goodbye to the friendship. Sometimes I think that I shouldn’t have answered him the first time he wrote to me online to avoid all the chaos and not to have fallen in love with him for not having been reciprocated, not because I hated him, and I have never hated him.

I saw him as my ideal person, and to date. I feel that if I met someone else I wouldn’t feel the same way I felt for my old friend. There were times when I dreamed of it after ghosting it.",1753732380.0,2025-07-28 19:53:00+00:00,2,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbqgfw/have_you_ever_felt_frustrated_by_an_impossible_or/
1mbqaxw,Oh hey so I do need my meds.,"My state insurance cut off because they're convinced I work a job that I held for two weeks back in October of 24. 

Because paying out of pocket was a lot, I decided to ween myself off and see how well I would do without them.

The first few days were fine. Now my anxiety is so bad I feel like I'm dying. I can't sleep because I keep thinking I can't breathe. 

I finally has the pharmacy go ahead and fill the anxiety meds. And I called the mental health hospital in charge of my refills to try and get my depression stuff refilled. Unfortunately you're supposed to see the psychiatrist every two months to keep getting the refills. I can't afford an appointment and told her nurse that I'm trying to get insurance back. She treats me like an addict that does deserve fucking Cymbalta because I haven't had a 15 minute conversation with the doctor about how everything is mostly the same. Last time nurse said she'd give me a month of med, but only did 15 days. Like wtf.

I called and left nurse a message today saying that if I can't get back on it, I'm going to end up in the ER at this rate.

The nurse does this all the time. She treats every patient like they don't deserve meds.

I don't know if I should stop down at the office and try to talk to a supervisor or what. I just wanna feel better.",1753732030.0,2025-07-28 19:47:10+00:00,1,2,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbqaxw/oh_hey_so_i_do_need_my_meds/
1mbq8sa,I just am not important,"I just don't matter to anybody. I'm pretty sick and no one cares to be there for me. To comfort me. To help me through my battles. It's just been such a struggle. I've lost the only two people that gave me hope in life. One is gone from this earth and the other has just clammed up on me big time. The walls are closing in on me and I fear I cannot stop them from doing so.

I just wanted one person I could rely on 100%. That would hold my hand until the end. That would hold me and tell me together we could conquer everything. I guess that is just too much to ask for. I'm just not worth that investment and it hurts me like you wouldn't believe. I'm feeling very left behind. I just can't find the will to go on or a very good reason to at that.

My health issues are out of control and I'm uncomfortable all the time. I really just want it all to stop. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of people just telling me it's just how it is. I just want love and support. Maybe some resolutions with my health too. I'm just not getting that. I told someone I'm close to that I just wanted to be held and told we could conquer anything together, but they just told me they were fine alone. That they didn't need me to be happy. That gutted me. No yes we can persevere together. No i'm here no matter what. Just a statement that alludes to me needing to deal with things alone.

I knew looking for the support I need with the problems I have was a long shot. I just thought I deserved it. I thought that maybe things would sort themselves out. It just isn't happening. I feel more isolated than ever. I don't think I'll make it like this. In fact I know I won't. So long as my neediness is looked down upon I am truly doomed. I just wanted another chance. I wanted to at least try for a good life. I just can't have that. Nobody can offer what I believe I need. I am going to cease to be before long. I've already lost myself.

Please pray for me. My name is Stephen. I need so much help no earthly vessel seems to want to help or be able to. I pray for strength. I pray for healing. I pray for forgiveness. I pray that someone truly amazing comes into my life. I just don't think it's going to happen. I doubt, but I foolishly still believe. My hope is gone. I'm now just driven by fear. Fear of the end, fesr of being alone, fear of my illnesses. The fear is winning. 

I will take hope anywhere I can get it. If anything or anyone can offer me that I'd be eternally grateful. Whatever higher power there is only knows what my outcome will be. I just want to be content. I just want to not worry all the time. I just want to be comfortable and not in pain all the time. Things are so very bad. I cannot do this on my own. Even with another it will still be immensely challenging. I have issues that will not improve. Only worsen. Because of that, I fear I will be alone. I fear I will meet my end soon and it will be alone.",1753731891.0,2025-07-28 19:44:51+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbq8sa/i_just_am_not_important/

1mbps97,I want to disappear because I gained weight,"I just turned 19, so I’m a grown woman now. I have a normal weight for a healthy body; I’m neither fat nor skinny. In the last few months, since I started university, I’ve gained a few kilograms. Stress, hormonal changes, chaotic eating on the go, and a lot of sitting due to studying—all of this has ensured good academic performance, but also a few extra kilos.

Right now, I hate my body, I hate myself, I hate looking in the mirror. Every acquaintance who sees me says, “Wow, you’ve gained weight.” And even though I know it’s true, it hurts. Especially because I’m actually working to lose weight. I exercise, I maintain a calorie deficit. But losing weight will take a few months, and I hate interacting with people out of fear they will judge me for gaining weight.

At 16, I had about the same weight as now, and because of bullying I lost so much weight that I fell into anorexia. I was anorexic for a year and a half, then reached a weight that put me in the “skinny” category. Now I’m no longer skinny, I consider myself ugly, I believe no one can love me because I don’t fit beauty standards.

And to make it even worse, my mother tells me that I’ve “put on weight.” My mother, who has been overweight for as long as I can remember. It hurts so much. It feels like people define me as a person only through my physical appearance and see nothing else.

Now I find it hard to leave the house, to socialize. I just want to disappear until I lose weight.

1mbpqeb,Advice needed to stop worrying,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for almost 4 years now. I feel I’m doing the right things and have made progress, so I first need to highlight that. I’m not on medication, my psychiatrist stopped my lexapro dose (it was a very low dose anyway) because I have been doing better. I’m in therapy too and I really have done overall better in realizing when anxiety is coming on, acknowledging it, saying “I don’t need you right now, thanks for being there though”.

But I have a ways to go. Currently, I find I worry a lot. I have an almost 2 year old son (I’m 32M btw), so I’m always in a constant state of awareness because, the way my therapist put it, “you’re keeping alive a human who, unknowingly, actively does things that could end his life”. I kind of chuckled at that because, well, they’re not wrong lol

Anyway, I worry I a lot. Not just about my sons safety, but everyday things. What used to be a fun annual “boys” trip hiking is now causing me distress. We’re three weeks away from the trip this year and I’m worried I’ll have a panic attack, or just general anxiety (because it has happened before. I ran a marathon earlier in the year and was literally vomiting 48 hours prior to the race because I was so worried/anxious. I finished btw, thanks to my wife who wouldn’t let me quit when I did have a panic attack between miles 14 through 20).

If you have any advice to combat the worrying, I won’t even use the word “stop”, just combat it it a bit, please share.

Its about my friend, lets call them S. Me and S were through a lot of stuff. We dated. We hated eachother. I comforted them, they comforted me. There was a period of when we didnt talk at all because for some reason I blocked them. I dont know - I was stupid back then.

They reached out to me first, even tho it was totally my fault. But im so grateful they reached out first, and we made up. It was great - daily talks, matching pictures, matching energy, just how it used to be.

We were friends. Dont get me wrong, we still are..but kinda not. Let me explain.

We dont talk anymore, but we never stopped talking if that makes sense. Neutral..I guess? But I think they hate me. After a bit of silence on both ends, I reached out. I said ""HEYY"". They were online, yet they didnt reply. I decided I wasnt gonna chase them.

Days passed. No reply. But theyre still online, hell - they even changed their pfp. TO A MATCHING ONE.

They clearly seen my text, but didnt even bother to answer. Am I not enough?? Do they deem me lesser than their other friend? It makes me wanna cry.

1mbpl05,I can feel objects in my mouth when I look at them or when I imagine them. What causes this?,"I just found out that this isn't normal.

So my friend sent me a selfie of herself with the wide lens and it made the texture of her skin very visible. And I keep feeling her nose in my mouth. I told her that I hated that it made me feel that way and she told me that that's not normal.

Since I could remember, I've always felt things in my mouth when I looked at them or imagined them. My favorite is a good glass marble. I actually start salivating when I imagine them in my mouth. Anything smooth and rubbery is welcome too.

Although I do have a disruptive urge to put things in my mouth, I'm able to control it when I'm around people. It helps when I chew on my tongue. Anyhow, it's still very disruptive. I'm often overwhelmed when the urges to just put things in my mouth are not satisfied.

All this time I thought that this was normal but I discussed it with my friend. We came to the conclusion that this is probably disruptive and all.

1mbova2,I'm angry.,"I don't know how to properly tell my emotions or how I am feeling. Everyone around me has always said that my mom has loved me, and that every time she's ever mean to me or ignores me, it's because she is tired or sick. 

Love for me is unconditional, and I don't feel loved by her, I feel taken care of. I feel like as long as I'm fed and there's a roof over my head, that there is no reason for her to care. I never truly had a good relationship with her, we've never talked, she's never told me she loved me and meant it, she never told me that I was worth her time. 

She said the exact opposite, that she does NOT have time for me. I want to be treated like the adult that I am, and not a baby like she thinks I should be treated. She hasn't allowed me to go outside at all, only to go somewhere that she approves of, like my brother's place. 

I felt so good there. I felt so free there, and I felt capable. 

She said that I could stay all night and for as long as I wanted, but she called and told me that I needed to go home. I didnt want to leave. Its gotten to a point where she told me that my labs came back, and I have a vitamin D deficiency. She had no idea why. 

Maybe because you never allow me to go outside?? I hate laying in bed all of the time, I don't want to do that. I want to be active, I dont want to eat junk food all day. Please stop buying it. I'm not a picky eater, I just forget to eat. 

I hate it. I absolutely hate it so much, I hate the way I am being treated. She has never ONCE given stuff to my siblings, its all to me. She has hit my siblings, she has yelled at them in public. Never at me? Why?? 

Why don't I matter to her? Why am I so useless to her, that she has to do everything for me? ",1753728821.0,2025-07-28 18:53:41+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbova2/im_angry/
1mbov51,Issue I don’t know how to fix,"So tbh I don’t know how to start this off, but I haven’t had the best of upbringings. (I’m 17) and I haven’t had the best of friends my whole life, I can’t remember a thing from younger then 14. Recently, everything that’s happened to me personally has been affecting me big time. I’ve been struggling to get up and out of bed recently, even to see the one person I feel understands me. I’ve lost my appetite completely, everything I enjoy isn’t any fun anymore, and I feel like I’m not living, I’m just existing, taking up space. I don’t know why this despair has started, but I can’t stop thinking about things that have happened. I haven’t been eating for days in a row, I haven’t been brushing my teeth etc. I suffered from an eating disorder for around a year before I was comfortable eating again, but it’s all coming back again. I don’t know what this is if there’s a name for it or if I can fix how I’m feeling, but quite frankly I’m sick of feeling like this. It’s been about a month and it’s showing no sign of going away. Sorry even if you can’t help I just needed to write it somewhere

1mboor2,"I'm 19, and I feel like I’ve lived a whole lifetime already. I’ve been through a lot, and I’m finally ready to talk.","

Since I was 12, I’ve felt emotionally neglected and unsupported. Things got a lot worse when I turned 16. I was always made to feel like I didn’t matter, like speaking up was disrespectful. I was never asked if I was okay. I wasn’t comforted when I was hurting. I was just told to stay quiet and stop complaining.

The emotional neglect affected me deeply, and it even shows physically. I have health issues I never should’ve had. I’ve also felt disconnected from myself as a girl/woman because of how little care and support I received. Meanwhile, my parents gave their attention and energy to others while I was left behind. They say they “tried,” but I know they didn’t.

When I graduated from high school, people gave me money and gifts. I wanted to buy something small for myself. But my parents took it all and spent it on cigarettes and coffee. Now, when I say no to giving them money, they call me heartless. But I was never given warmth to begin with.

I lived with silent depression for years. I still deal with it, especially when I stay in this house too long. The environment here drains me. The denial, the emotional pressure, the gaslighting. I tried to speak up recently and was told I was being dramatic. But I wasn’t asking for anything special just basic respect and acknowledgment.

My father changed after losing his job became passive, bitter, cold. When guests came over, he acted warm and caring. But with me, there was nothing. I often came home dizzy and starving after tutoring sessions. He didn’t notice or care. But when cousins visited, he treated them like royalty.

When I was 16, he brought a 22-year-old male cousin to live with us. None of us were okay with it, but he insisted. That changed everything in our home  it got darker, more hostile. My mom accused him of betrayal, and even though I don’t know everything that happened, I know something wasn’t right.

That same year, my brother failed school. He couldn’t handle the pressure. My dad didn’t support him just blamed him. I passed my exams the year after, but I don’t remember much from that time. I blocked a lot out to cope.

I no longer want to save my mother. I tried, but she didn’t want to leave or face the truth. Now I just want to save myself. I want to heal and rebuild my life. But being in this house makes that hard.

I’m not looking for revenge. I’m not even asking for sympathy. I just want to move forward. I want to get better. I know I don’t need medication or a diagnosis right now I need clarity and a sense of direction.

So I’m asking: What can I do to start healing and feeling better, while I’m still living in this house and can’t leave yet?

If anyone has been through something similar, I’d really appreciate your advice or even just your thoughts.

1mboexg,Sometimes I end up wishing the Holidays were here,"I have a long and neverending string of depression and anxiety most of the year. Its rare that I feel any genuine sense of comfort, especially for long periods of time. But for some reason, November and December are the exceptions. 









I feel like the world makes more sense. Everything suddenly feels okay. I'm a sucker for 1940s christmas music so its nice going to Walmart or Mcdonalds or some shit and just sitting there listening to it on the radio. I love when it snows (as long as I don't have to walk in it) and I really love Christmas. As soon as Christmas ends is when those feelings go away, though. Right back to extreme depression and all hope is gone just like that.








The only time this wasn't the case was 2018, my grandma died a few days after Thanksgiving and thats probably the lowest I felt in years. 








Is it that way for anyone else?",1753727817.0,2025-07-28 18:36:57+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mboexg/sometimes_i_end_up_wishing_the_holidays_were_here/
1mbocpv,How can I support my girlfriend's mental health while we're both struggling with uni?,"I'm a 1st-year university student and my girlfriend is in her 3rd year. Lately, she's been going through a really tough time mentally. She recently reposted some TikToks expressing how drained and unhappy she feels at university. One of them said, *""Can we please normalize college not being the best years of your life... I've never been this unhappy and I just want to be home 24/7,""* and the other one was about the overwhelming pressure of trying to juggle mental health, grades, family expectations, and friendships.

She keeps telling me she can't do this anymore — that she needs to go home and leave uni. The thing is, I totally understand her pain, but I don't know how to help. I'm just a 1st-year student myself, and I don't have a job or any way to support her financially if she decides to leave university. I can't just tell her to quit and go home, even if that seems like what she needs.

I care about her deeply and want to be there for her, but I'm honestly lost on what I can do to actually support her mental health during this time. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What are some practical or emotional things I can do to help her feel even a little better?",1753727683.0,2025-07-28 18:34:43+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbocpv/how_can_i_support_my_girlfriends_mental_health/
1mboarz,"Social life: Is it my depression, am I now an introvert, or am I just getting older?","Hello, (24M) I have had major depression for almost a decade now. Length primarily due to lack of therapy, but the meds are working great.

I'm concerned about a shift in my social life. I think it could be either depression, a change in personality, or maybe it could just be life. 

For the past few years I noticed a shift in social activity. Last semester I went to dorms in university and I spent most of it alone. There would be times where I felt too lonesome and would hang out with people on my floor; I'm no hikikomori. 

The problem is that I love to meet new people. In highschool I would hop from clique to clique to talk to everyone. 

It's not just new people too. I used to spend everyday chatting with friends on discord, but recently it's once a month; I just don't have the energy for it. 

It's weird to me. Sure, life is more busy now that I'm taking school more seriously, but I can't tell what is happening. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

1mbo1c5,My partner has treatment resistant depression - I don't know what to do,"My partner 35 (M) has had depression for most of his life and says he has had bad episodes in the past and is now better. We've been dating 6 months and recently he had a bad episode where I had to take him to the doctor and the hospital. I had been telling him to go get help earlier but he let it get to the point where he had a mental breakdown. 

There is history of mental illness in my family and the women becoming caregivers for the men because of their very bad mental health. Including my mom and dad ( which later caused them to split up) 

I love my boyfriend very much and he's lovely to me. He is also very anxiously attached and unfortunately not very good at coping with his depression. After this episode he is more proactive with getting help and looking to see a somatic therapist on my recommendation etc. 

I am terrified I will become my mother and that I will have to care for a man who will not be capable as a partner or father. That I will have to constantly be a caregiver to him and I will always have to look over my shoulder for the next breakdown. 

Now, he's amazing and deserves to be with someone who can support him. I worry that because of my own trauma I may not be the best person for him and him for me. Although he says that I'm perfect for him. This is eating at me, I don't want to hurt him nor do I want to continue staying in a situation which will harm both of us inevitably. I'm struggling. 

I don't even know if I want advice, but open to hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation and what you did that helped you/ the relationship.

It’s like a weird form of emotional release, happening almost without me realizing it. Why is it having this effect on me?

1mbnd6l,I (22 f) insulted my bf (23 m) while blackout drunk,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 years, but were best friends for 3.5 years prior to that. Our relationship started out amazing, as most do, and we tackled long distance (750 miles away) really well. About a year ago, my bf started a job in consulting (he was in college until 2024, I’ll be graduating in 2026) and since then has been working 60+ hours a week. It has undeniably taken a toll in our relationship. There’s a lack of consistent connection and passion, and I’ve been unhappy for a while. His working hours, while not directly his fault, are largely due to him taking on projects out of fearing for his job security. While I understand and respect this, the lack of overall connection we’ve been able to have due to his schedule and exhaustion has been a point of contention. About a week ago, I told him that I was feeling a little burnt out, and was unsure of how I felt towards remaining in a relationship with him. The core of our existence in each other’s lives is as best friends, and we’ve always strived to protect that. He’s been extremely supportive of my uncertainty and everything I could ask for. To provide a little further background, I’m half Salvadoran, and grew up speaking Spanish and being immersed in Latin American culture. However, as I’ve grown up, my mom stopped speaking Spanish to me and earlier this week, I realized that my maternal grandmother is losing her memory very rapidly. I’ve been devastated and mourning the loss of culture that will inevitably happen as my grandmother’s condition progresses, as my mother ages, etc. Meanwhile, a friend of a friend connected with me recently and I’ve been really excited/eager to befriend him because he’s Latine as well. On Saturday, I went out to a bar and got incredibly drunk. I have almost zero recollection of this, but I called my boyfriend at around 1 am and apparently insulted him, laughed at him, and made comments along the lines of “Why can’t you be brown like ____”. I am utterly disgusted with myself, horrified, and heartbroken. I am at a loss for words. When I woke up yesterday, though I didn’t remember what I had said, I immediately knew I had fucked up. I called my boyfriend and he didn’t elaborate much on what I told him on the phone, but he said “I’ve never been more offended and disgusted by you”. He’s asked for space, and I am doing so after I’ve of course profusely and sincerely apologized, and outlined actionable next steps for me (therapy, big break from drinking, reaching out to friends, etc). I know there’s not much else I can do from here on out. I am just truly and completely gutted at my behavior. I think I’m going to lose him, both as a partner and as a friend, and I hate myself.

TLDR; I got blackout drunk, called my boyfriend, and said some extremely damaging thing. I don’t remember pretty much any of it. Have been unhappy/struggling for a while, but working on it and moving through. Don’t know how to navigate this or live with myself going forward.",1753725519.0,2025-07-28 17:58:39+00:00,5,1,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbnd6l/i_22_f_insulted_my_bf_23_m_while_blackout_drunk/

I feel nothing most days. I take care of myself physically — shower, get dressed — but inside I feel like a ghost.

My family is complicated. My mom left me with relatives for years in another city. I felt abandoned. I wasn’t allowed to express anger or sadness. I was scared.

Now, even when someone cares for me, I get angry. It feels fake. I don’t know how to accept love. I think I don’t deserve it.

I want help. I want to talk to a therapist, but I’m scared they’ll say I’m just fine.

1mbn20s,29M Struggling with plagiocephaly and feeling lost,"Hello. My purpose with this post is not to ask for help with antidepressants or therapy, but something physical. I have plagiocephaly on the right side, just above the ear, right on the corner of the head, and also a dent in the center, on the back of my head. I’m 29 years old and I’ve been trying to survive with this somehow..

I don’t enjoy my life. I’ve never had a girlfriend or even a good friend. Not because I can’t, but because most of the time I just don’t want it. It’s weird because when I’m home, I feel like going out, being with people, doing something. But then when I’m finally around people, I always feel one step behind. I look at the way they talk to each other, how they laugh and have fun, and I just feel like I don’t belong to them. 

No one understands what it’s like to live with a weird-shaped head. It’s like I have two different heads: the left side is normal, peaceful, like I don’t feel anything, it's really like heaven, but the right side feels like there’s something inside, or like something is pushing. It gets worse when I’m cold, tired, anxious, or didn’t sleep well and I just hate this.

Sometimes it affects my concentration, but apart from that I’m “normal”. No one would guess I have this, because it’s covered by hair and not that noticeable.. But I feel it all the time, and I honestly can’t live like this anymore.

I often imagine myself dying, like different ways I could do it. I imagine the funeral, my mom crying and how tragic it would be, and even though I think she failed me a lot as a mothe, especially when I was born with this very noticeable head shape and throughout my life, I know she loves me and she did everything she could as a mom, and I love her in some way, so I don’t do it. That’s what has kept me here until now.

Right now I’m solo travelling. My grandmother is the one who made this trip possible for me. I’ve been travelling for one and a half months, but these last two weeks have been tough. I’ve felt no motivation to be around people, i’ve cried before sleeping, and after waking up, just thinking about how much pain it would cause if I killed myself. It’s not even about me anymore, it’s about them.

That’s actually the mistake I always make. I smile, I try to look normal, I pretend to care about socializing, but in reality I just want to be alone. I just want to isolate myself and play games, do nothing. Time goes by, I’m almost 30 now, and I feel like I didn’t live and didn’t accomplish anything. I just want it all to stop.

I never talked about this before. One of the reasons I’ve hidden everything is because I know my brother also has mental problems. Can you imagine being a parent and having not just one, but two kids with serious mental struggles?

What makes me sad is also that I’m somehow an attractive person. I like my body, I’m a tall guy, and just the idea that I could be a normal guy if I had been born with a normal shaped head makes me very emotional. It’s just a shame… It’s frustrating because I feel like I could have a good life, a girlfriend, be confident, just like any other person. But this one thing, something I didn’t choose, completely ruins how I see myself and my future.

I don’t know what to do. I just had to write this. If I ever manage to get out of this hole, I want to help other people with mental health problems. But right now, I don’t see a bright future. And it’s hard when this feeling has been around since I can remember.

1mbmsm9,Reported abuse. Therapist quietly removed from website. Trainee who defended him promoted. Is this justice or PR optics?,"I had reported a boundary violation involving a male therapist who emotionally entangled me while I was in a vulnerable place.
 The owner of the organization removed his profile from their website but not other social media and made updates saying no therapists are affiliated with their organization. They just promote therapists on basis of votes and who is most ethical.

But here's what I found disturbing , the trainee who was working under that therapist and was aware of the unethical behavior was not publicly addressed. In fact, weeks later, this same trainee was promoted on the organization's official page. 

I had specifically told the founder that I did not want the trainee punished, only that things be handled with integrity and care and trainees should be taught well but this feels like erasure, or worse like loyalty to even unethical therapists is being rewarded. 

Is this common in the mental health world? 
Do organizations protect their own and rebrand scandals as progress? Or am I misreading it all?

I never talk to them, they don’t speak — it’s just a strong sense of their presence. It started as harmless daydreaming (like imagining myself as the main character to music), but now it’s daily, automatic, and I can’t shut it off.

Sometimes I even imagine how these characters would react to seeing me — which recently became disturbing. For example, I had an intrusive thought in the shower where a fictional ""observer"" reacted to me being naked like I was ""clean, good material."" That thought disgusted me, but now I can’t unsee it, and it comes back every time I undress.

I understand these aren’t real and I’m still functioning normally — I go about my day, I know reality is reality. But these thoughts feel intrusive, uncomfortable, and constant. I don’t hear voices or believe in conspiracies. It’s more like a background mental noise that won’t go away.

Is this a form of OCD, maladaptive daydreaming, or something else? I can't afford therapy right now, so any feedback would help.",1753723872.0,2025-07-28 17:31:12+00:00,2,3,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmmjb/i_feel_like_someones_always_watching_me_every_day/
1mbmlq5,Feeling extremely lonely,"I feel terrible for really long time niw. Weather is terrible and I have summer break. I was waiting for this moment for a long time, It was in fact the only thing I was waiting for and now I don’t even really know why. I think I didn’t want my summer break to start, more like wanting to everything else to end.

Now I feel like no matter what happens it just doesn’t get better but anyway. I am really actively trying to get better, I am doing so many things; learning ro play guitar, drawing, speak Spanish, making new habits, cooking, everything. So now I think I am just lonely. I installed tinder to solve that but obviously it is crap. I got maches, I was talking to some people but it comes to an end really quick. I think it is because it is so unnatural and strange? Also I am not a type of person to hang on phone all day.

What do I do? Should I go to some party alone? I just want to have someone to talk to but I have to have contact in real life. I want to tell someone about my drawings, accomplishments and thoughts. I really think I am not an awful person; I have friends but now everyone is going to different schools and my new friends live really far away and everyone have their own life, other friends, fancy trips etc. I don’t why it is like that.",1753723825.0,2025-07-28 17:30:25+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmlq5/feeling_extremely_lonely/
1mbmbcy,I'm unattractive but not physically,"I (19f) have been insecure about my appearance for a long time. I've been rejected by guys a lot in the past which makes me afraid to make a move. I've been in a relationship three times during my entire life which isn't bad, but I don't get approached often by guys and men are often very mean to me for no particular reason and treat me different than they treat other women. I thought this was due to me being physically unattractive but I don't even look that bad and Im actually pretty average, I also often get DMs from men online but am rarely approached in person. I probably have some sort of neodivergency- I've never been diagnosed but I have tics since I was little, and those tics are very noticeable and uncontrollable, I can't control the tone of my voice so I always sound like I'm yelling, my body language is generally very weird, I need a lot of time to process everything that is going on around me, and I have a hard time noticing and understanding social constructs. I think my tics and my body language and my voice is what makes me unattractive no matter how great I look. Even if I do my makeup and dress up nicely, no one will look at me twice. I also have a hard time making friends and I barely get invited to hang out. I only have a few people that Im comfortable to text or invite to hang out because in the past, people found excuses not to hang out with me and just never told me directly that they didn't want to. I just think I'm too weird and don't know how to fix myself. I study at my dream college and I still feel like the biggest loser on earth. I also feel like I'll die alone and like no one is interested in me. I feel unloveable, as if I'm uncapable of being seen in any romantic or sexual sense. People all think that Im very confident and no one even has an idea how I feel about myself. Some people I know often make jokes about my appearance thinking I'll take it well because I seem confident on the outside but jokes like that actually damaged my self esteem a lot. I feel disgusting all the time. ",1753723183.0,2025-07-28 17:19:43+00:00,5,5,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmbcy/im_unattractive_but_not_physically/
1mbmb3b,Self-Identity issues - what is the real me?,"I (M21) have been struggling with my sense of self lately, I can’t seem to figure out who I truly am at my core. 

People describe me in very positive ways - confident, optimistic, mature, kind. 
Yet, I really struggle comprehending that and believing those things since I truly think I’m not a good person. 

My thoughts are negative, judgemental, mean and just all around bad, even towards the people closest to me.
I just choose not to act on those thoughts since I know it’s morally wrong to be that way, especially to those undeserving and innocent. 

So, do my actions define my character and who I truly am at my core? 
Or is the real me the one within my thoughts saying all these negative things?

I've floated through life with the path of least resistance. It has finally blow up in my face. I'm essentially starting over in my mid 20s. I'm going back to school now for a career change. I'm single now and have no real financial obligations. It will be a long and hard process but I'm going to take this as an opportunity to improve myself and learn how to live a full life for myself. I'm going to add periodic (maybe daily if I remember) to track my progress. If that sounds annoying let me know and I'll stop but I figure here could be a good place for accountability but also to maybe offer hope or encouragement to someone.

1mblt8x,I (25F) love my father but feel very anxious when I’m around him… like I want him to be happy and safe but I want to be far away from him,"Over the past few years up to this day, my father has been pushing me to agree to a marriage. It’s common in the South Asian community that when you’re 22+ generally family tends to look for potential partners. Last few years have been bad because I don’t like any of the matches my family has brought. He gets very frustrated when I say I don’t like the people he brings. Few days he got violent and almost hit me. He asks me why I don’t like them, he says they have eyes a nose and a mouth what else do you want. In ‘23 I just agreed to a guy because he said he’d marry me off to someone whether I like it or not. I didn’t like the guy at all… but I made up my mind. Anyway it didn’t work out (thank god) but we almost got married. That’s a different trauma. But he keeps bringing random people from a website, they don’t match my educational standards or life standards. I can’t even hold a conversation with some of them… he seems to be okay with the gap and he just wants me to say yes to someone. 
I definitely don’t want to get married to someone I don’t like. My dad was out for about 5 days for work… I felt so much peace at home. The rest of the family is also not in good spirits with me because my the rocky relationship between my father and I are affecting them. But still I felt so much peace. He just came back and I feel like I’m so close to having a panic attack even though he didn’t talk to me yet. I have this chronic cough that won’t go away and honestly for the past few days it was gone… and today it’s back… I love him and he’s done so much for me… if id ask for a rocket he’d still get me one. All except for this marriage problem. I feel horrible for not wanting to be around him… just hearing his phone ring makes me feel uneasy. I need to overcome this… ik you will ask me to move out but I can’t, I’m not stable enough… I’m a teacher and my salary is not enough to… no job in my country pays well enough so that you can move out so soon. 
Please give me some suggestions to battle my anxiety… ",1753722099.0,2025-07-28 17:01:39+00:00,3,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mblt8x/i_25f_love_my_father_but_feel_very_anxious_when/
1mblsb6,"I have to start taking lexapro, and was wondering if anyone has had success with it?","I currently take 250mg (25% more than the FDA max dosage) of Zoloft. Zoloft was fine, and it worked for me, until one day I released that it didn't anymore. I had slowly slipped back into old habits, messy room, not doing homework (I just turned 40 and still haven't finished my undergrad in computer science that I have been working on for literally 20 years no exaggeration). I was doing good, 8 years ago I started back on my ADHD meds (Adderall and Zoloft) and had several great semesters. But the past few years I noticed I take a single class per semester, and half the time I don't pass it.

Anyway, after talking to my doctor (or psychiatrist or w/e) they thought I should start Lexapro. I agreed, and was all in, but now I am worried. After reading the side effects and how common they are I am scared to take it.

1mblmqr,My mum's mental health is getting worse,"Idk if this is the right subreddit to post this, lets try.

I (19F) live together with my single mum. She is unemployed, I work fulltime to support us. She suffers from depression and anxiety since about 25 years, she was always on medication and used to go to therapy until about 10 years ago. In the past two years, her overall mental condition has worsened. She completely changed, she doesn't go out of the house or meet with friends anymore, she is quiet, she rarely talks to anyone except me, she refuses to take medication and overall is obviously depressed. 

About three months ago, her psychological symptoms became psychosomatic. She was feeling sick all the time, had high blood pressure, stopped eating, wasn't able to take any pills and ended up in hospital 7 times in the last couple of weeks. She got so weak that she is only able to move around in a wheelchair, she needs help showering and going to the toilet. Every time she gets out of the hospital she was feeling better for a couple of days before everything went back to 'normal'. We never got any specific diagnosis from doctors except a referral to a psychologial rehabilitation clinic, we are currently waiting for them to admit her (which can take weeks according to the doctors). 

In the meantime, we both suffer from her mental problems. I try everything to make her feel okay and loved. I cook her whatever she wants to eat (if she wants to eat). I make sure she take her pills, I take her for walks in the wheelchair, I comfort her ect. I know that I myself can't change her overall problems as they are way to bad, but I'm still wondering what I at home can do to support her better.

1mbllcl,I’m tired of being told I think to deeply into things when all I’m needing is understanding. This is who I am as person.,"Hi there,
I’ve been in this state for a while now not knowing exactly how to feel about anything. There is a load of mental confusion that has me now randomly bursting into tears in public, feeling judged, belittled, not enough, hateful, unsupported and i feel that I am hyper emotional. I’ve always been constantly denied to the room to open up and am usually rushed off as annoying or not worth hearing. The feeling of being unaccomplished put the cherry on top.

I had a moment yesterday where my mother asked my little brother to pass the syrup from his plate. I could see his hands were busy as he was rushing to scarf his food down, so I thought I would help by passing it to her for him. Trying to be helpful. He yells “why couldn’t you let me pass it to her?” I didn’t think there was a reason to speak to his older sister like that but it made me feel stupid, unneeded. Such a small thing suddenly became a big matter for me in a couple of seconds. I felt the emotional breakdown coming. I started to tear up doing my best to swallow my tears. Because I knew what was to come next. My mother’s judgement.

“Why does your face always look so vexed?” “You can’t ever go out and have a good time.” “You’re always thinking too deep, it ruins the mood.” “We can’t take you anywhere.” 

The thing is I know she’s the cause of why I’m like this. It was drilled into me growing up “think before you move.” “Think before you talk.” “Watch your mouth.” Note it was never because I was disrespectful. It was when my response is “no” or if it was to make someone else comfortable.

I am now always thinking about everything. I feel I have sacrificed myself emotionally and mentally for everyone else and feeling of when I feel it’s my turn to have someone listen, no one is willing. I am tired. Tired of feeling neglected, tired of feeling I am the black hole, tired of the fake love, tired of everyone pretending to care. I feel a deep sense of hatred coming from the pit of my gut and I would rather it not get to that point.

I am writing this as I’ve just got done bawling my eyes out in the airport bathroom and having further negative thoughts that this will all just end. I want to drop off the grid. Not have to seek anyone, call anyone (family or friend), just be by myself.

I can’t do this anymore.

1mbll8m,How do you guys figure out what meds are worth it when nothing is working?,"Genuinely curious how people make these decisions. I’ve been on and off different meds for months now while some helped a little, some made things worse, and some just did absolutely nothing?? It’s honestly exhausting trying to figure out what’s actually doing something and what’s just noise.

I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t even know what’s a symptom anymore and what’s a side effect. Like am I tired because of the condition or because of the med? Is the brain fog from my body or my treatment? It’s such a mess to untangle. Lately I’ve been doing everything I can think of like tracking symptoms every day, comparing notes with people who have similar issues, reading way too many Reddit threads, I even ran my med history through this online health tool EurekaHealth to see if anything would stand out and It actually flagged a few things I hadn’t thought about before but of course before giving me any medicine I need to consult with a doctor and that’s kind of the problem I haven’t found one who’ll really dig into it with me without just brushing me off.

Do you guys go off gut instinct? Give it a strict timeline or keep trying stuff until something feels right? I feel like I’m just throwing darts and hoping one finally hits the target. Would love to hear how you’ve approached it especially if you’ve been in that same nothing’s really working phase.",1753721634.0,2025-07-28 16:53:54+00:00,40,10,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbll8m/how_do_you_guys_figure_out_what_meds_are_worth_it/

1mblc1v,Laughing uncontrollably when nervous,"I have really bad anxiety, especially in school it’s deeply rooted in that and certain public spaces. I’ve been recently noticing a pattern with myself where if I’m talking to someone and I get anxiety I immediately start laughing.. and then it never stops. I’m not exaggerating at all it sounds funny but it’s put me on the spot in such bad times 😥 No one I know has this problem and every time an episode of that happens people look at me like I’m crazy and then eventually it’s awkward and they ask me why I’m laughing.. but it’s never on purpose and I really can’t control it. It’s usually when there’s silence with a lot of people or one-on-one conversations which is horrible it’s a nightmare. 

Trying to describe it it’s kind of like my throat closing and then I feel myself smiling and giggling and then it never stops.. and usually people try to play it off as a hahaha and then it ends as what are you even laughing at? I did this at my friend’s house because we were eating with her little brother and suddenly I couldn’t stop. It was bad like I couldn’t even take a bite of my food.. it’s just the sensation of my throat closing and then it’s never ending and EVEN THEN I’ll still giggle about it sometimes. 

This usually happens with non-funny things by the way.. or like something I didn’t find funny but I laugh anyways. Does anyone have the same problem or feel the same? I try to laugh like that at home because it makes me feel better, but I can’t it’s only in those scenarios that it truly happens. It sounds stupid but it’s kind of becoming a “serious” problem and I’m going back to school soon so how do I stop? It’s the most prevalent in school or with one person conversations. Water doesn’t help either because eventually I won’t be able to swallow and deep breaths make it worse. It’s those silent laughs kind of that you can’t control, except I literally can’t.

1mbl1k2,Dealing with psychosomatic symptoms and feeling hopeless. Is there a way out?,"TW: SH.
 Hi, I (20F) have been struggling with unexplained physical illnesses since around 2022. I always believed I had some underlying physical problem, but recently I consulted a psychiatrist for the first time and I was diagnosed with psychosomatic disorder.

I’ve had serious symptoms like gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal issues. These aren’t just “in my head” they’re real, painful, and disruptive. But I’ve noticed a pattern: whenever I’m under intense stress, I fall sick, and when the stress goes away, so do the symptoms.

It all began during a course I took a few years ago. I dropped a year, felt pressured, and from that point on, I developed several physical issues that lasted until the course ended. Then, I joined university. Things were fine initially, but after a year, I developed stomach problems again, which only stopped after I changed my living environment. Now, I’m in my third year, and once again, I’ve developed new physical symptoms ,this time musculoskeletal. It’s like my body responds to my emotional state by shutting down.

My biggest trigger right now is my university life I simply don’t enjoy it. And whenever I feel stressed or don’t want to go, I get physically sick. This cycle has become exhausting, and I just want it to stop. I still have three more years left, and I’m terrified of continuing to suffer like this.

I come from a chaotic family background. My parents fought constantly, and I never really felt safe or happy growing up. I didn't get to live like a normal child, and it deeply affected my mental health. While my dad is supportive now, he has his own issues, and I don’t feel comfortable burdening him. I also can’t open up to friends they wouldn’t get it. I feel completely alone in this.

Despite endless hospital visits and medications, doctors often tell me I’m physically fine and that I’m just overthinking which only makes me feel worse. Lately, I’ve started getting panic attacks and struggling with insomnia. It feels like I can’t control my brain, and I don’t know how to stop this.

My family doesn’t believe in therapy, so they won’t support me seeking help. That’s one of the hardest parts when the few solutions I try to reach are blocked by the people around me. I’ve become constantly frustrated, angry, and emotionally drained. I never used to feel this way.

1mbkxan,"its me, your mind","*It’s Me, Your Mind

It’s me, your mind.
I’m trapped in the body of someone else—a vessel that moves with energy and wears a gleeful smile, but holds no soul to see.
The darkness isn’t just around me; it’s within me, consuming every thought, every breath.
I am the sad song, the story of a shattered heart. There’s nothing left to see, nothing left to save.
It’s me, your mind—a ||fucked-up|| machine caught in an endless loop of despair.

Everything feels doable in the light, or so they say. But I wouldn’t know. I’ve never felt the light—not truly. I sit here, in the darkness of myself, unable to see, unable to hear the sounds of saviors and aid just outside my reach. The emptiness that defines me pulls me deeper, down into the event horizon of ||death||, where escape feels impossible.

When the light shuts off, it’s just me against myself. A body at war with its brain, a soul waiting to be discovered, a heart left to ||bleed|| and plead—with no aid to be given. What am I now? Just another broken song. A hard shell with a soft, crumbling core inside.

The night—the darkness—devours me whole, and it takes its toll. A fleeting light flashes before my eyes, like a promise of escape, only to vanish as quickly as it came. A tale sealed in time, a story never to be told.

Life is ruthless and unforgiving. People come and go, their presence as fleeting as the wind. And at the end of the day, no matter how many hands reached for you in the past, you’re left with only yourself. You took your first breath alone, and you will take your last the same way.

“No one cares when you’re alive. All the care comes after you’ve passed.”

And that’s the cruelest truth of all.*

1mbkpde,Overcoming anhedonia?,"I was wondering if anyone had any advice for overcoming a feeling of anhedonia and lack of motivation to really do anything.

For the past few years of my life I’ve started to find a complete lack of motivation to really do anything, it started off small and overtime has gotten gradually worse to the point where I’m just constantly bored searching for anything to do.

Right now it’s the summer and I’m in high school which obviously means I have a lot of spare time but I have very little interest in doing anything I feel like I should do.

I have normal interests like video games and tv shows and reading but I can never even open a game for 10 minutes or read a page of a book without getting overwhelming bored and quitting.

I always imagine myself completely the task in my head but immediately quit when I actually try to do it.

I’m not like this in school, when I have a set task like studying or writing an essay it’s very easy for me to focus on it and get it done asap. I’m also not depressed in the emotional sense, I don’t feel hopeless and I really just want to get better and improve my self and I feel like this is just temporary. Though I know depression is complex and can show itself in many ways.

Oh and I don’t have any distractions really, I don’t have TikTok or instagram or twitter and I just installed this app today for this post. Otherwise I just watch YouTube videos sometimes. Most of my time is spent just listening to music and thinking and talking to people.

Any advice would be really helpful, I’m considering seeing a therapist maybe.",1753719687.0,2025-07-28 16:21:27+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbkpde/overcoming_anhedonia/

My cousin recently cut me off from her life on the grounds that we haven't been talking as often as we used to. FYI, we both have busy lives and I started university Fall 2025 while she went away for the National Gaurd. She has also stopped talking to and blocked all of her other family memebers, including her young sisters who range from toddlers to middle schoolers. Before blocking me, our last conversation was about how she was planning on marrying this guy she met during basic and moving in together. Btw, shes only 19 years old (the guy is give or take a year older than her). I didn't think she was serious about it but i just recently saw her post on her instagram that they got married with a venue and everything (it was just the two of them tho, no guests, atleast none were in the photos). The only person she follows on Instagram is her new husband. Her parents don't know where she is cause she doesn't talk to them and yea i'm just concerned for her safety. She also cheated on him multiple times in the relationship and he doesn't know about it. Maybe its just a personal issue shes having with her family or a mental health problem because ik shes has had issues with her parents for a while but yea. Maybe if someone could just share their similar experience and what ended up happening and anyway I can ensure her safety.

1mbkgk8,How do I explain my short employment and long gaps due to mental health?,"I'm 31f, from England. I've suffered with mental health problems since I was a child, gone through all different types of help, and had lots of temporary ups and massive lows. I managed to get through university with a first-class honours degree nearly a decade ago, but in a creative course that focuses on television. It's kind of a nothing degree for me at this point that unsurprisingly doesn't open any doors.



Since uni, I've never been able to keep a job for long. The longest I've ever stayed at a job before having a complete breakdown is a year and a half (this was my last job). Other than that, the average is about 6 months or less. Whereas the gaps in between jobs have been between about 6 months to a year or so, with the worst case exception of the current gap I'm in now, a year and 8 months. I left my last job because my manager drove me out and preyed on my mental health issues (I'd never told a company before, and never will again after that). I've come from a lot of horrible work environments, but I honestly can say that my mental health was a key factor in why I left every job that was meant to be permanent.



With so many gaps, such short stays at companies, and my current huge gap in employment, I feel like I've been blacklisted. I mostly go for work from home roles and part-time roles as I'm still always dealing with my health to some degree and feel far more capable of coping and doing a good job in those roles. But 99% of jobs that I apply for don't respond to me, and the incredibly rare 1% that I get to speak to don't want to know anything about me other than the gaps and short-term employment. And ""personal reasons"", ""health reasons"" and ""temporary employment"" don't seem to cut it. I can tell as soon as I try to explain why I left a role or why I've been out of work for so long so many times, my application is straight in the bin.



It doesn't help that I'm someone with very low self-esteem, social anxiety and introverted. Being constantly ignored or rejected is not helping my confidence in finding work. I can't change my past and can only hope and try to for my mental health and time in work to improve, but not if I can never even get to an interview stage. So my question is, how do I spin the negatives on my CV to actually get employers interested and not write me off? Do I lie about the reasons? Do I just make up or delete a bunch of my history? I'm at a loss.



Please no mental health judgement, I just need advice on how to come across better when applying for jobs. Especially from anyone that has been or is in a similar situation and feels they can help.",1753719143.0,2025-07-28 16:12:23+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbkgk8/how_do_i_explain_my_short_employment_and_long/
1mbkedo,i feel like im mentally delayed,"I dont mean the title in a bad way, i genuinely think somewhere innmy mind i got stuck as a child. I feel so behind everyone my age and always have, i even feel behind people younger than me. Not that im stupid or anything, but my priorities and interests have always been so different to everyone around me.

In the first couple years of highschool, while everyone else was focusing on their social media or clothes or relationships or whatever else, i was still playing pretend being a cat or dog or whatever when i was at home. When everyone else got hobbies, i was still playing with toys and prefferred them over anything else up until i was 16 (i still do prefer toys over most other things tbh..). I feel like im so behind everyone else. I get so excited to set up my toy collections and organise them and make pretty outfits and watch kinda childish youtube videos and watch children's movies. I do like doing 'adult' things, like going to the pub or whatever, but thats rare and i prefer to stay home or be with my best friend.

I mean cognitively im definitely 19, but i feel like im stunted somewhere in my mind. Ive felt behind since i was maybe 10-13ish ?? Im leaning more towards 12, tbh. But maybe thats when i realised something was wrong with me.

I have BPD, OCD, PTSD, depression, anorexia, general and social anxiety and suspected bipolar. Could any of those be causing this? Is my mind permanently regressed?? I feel like i definitely regress sometimes, idk how to explain it but i lose interest in anything but playing with toys or watching movies and drawing and my art even regresses when that happens and usually it happens when im stressed.

I have no clue whats wrong with me, or if this is all normal and im just stupid🫠",1753719012.0,2025-07-28 16:10:12+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbkedo/i_feel_like_im_mentally_delayed/

1mbk38z,i sont wanna live anymore,"I should have said this a long time ago, but I couldn’t keep it bottled up anymore. I just can’t handle all the things I’ve seen and been through. Since I was 10 years old, I was sent away to a boarding school until I was almost 18. During those years, I had to take responsibility for everything — always watching my brothers, doing all the household chores, cleaning up. And no matter what, I was always the one who got blamed. As the years passed, all this became normal. I never had anyone on my side.

My family was abusive — shouting, hitting — and I was left completely alone. It’s so sad. I used to think that one day the pain would just go away, but that was the dumbest thing I ever believed. The scars stayed, and the loneliness stayed.

My mom and dad also always took money from me. I haven’t spoken to my dad in years, and honestly, I barely even know him. My mom hasn’t changed either. When I was 17 or 18, I was stuck at home while she went out, having fun and enjoying herself, acting like I didn’t even exist. She posts on social media like she’s living the best life, happy and perfect. Meanwhile, I’m left invisible.

Now I’m 18, here in Turkey — which I didn’t want, by the way — forced to be here because she needs to take care of her paperwork. And I’m expected to watch the kids like I always do, like it’s nothing. Like I don’t have my own life or feelings.

I can’t keep living like this. I’m exhausted. I’m broken. But I want to get help. I want to be able to say all this to someone who will listen and actually care. I want to learn how to heal, how to build a life where I matter.

That’s why I’m going to tell the doctor everything. Because I can’t carry this alone anymore.

Also, I’m wondering — should I take the step to tell all of this to my doctor? Or is that not the right choice? I feel like I need help, but I’m scared and unsure if it’s okay to share everything. I want to do what’s best for me.

1mbjwbe,Rumination and infatuation,"I have a problem, and I let it ruin my friendship.

I tend to obsess over people. They become the center of my universe. Everything I do revolves around them. I'll be up all night, day dreaming about them. It's exhausting, especially when you don't want it. It's involuntary. Compulsive. It seeps into my dreams, tricking me into believing that that person is my destiny. Even though this has happened more than once, and I know it isn't real, I still wake up believing it. At least until I come out of my sleepy stupor. 
The rest of the morning is spent replaying the dream in my head, getting caught up in the fantasy, and then feeling guilty for finding pleasure in a lie. 
Typically I can tell the difference between infatuation and the real thing, and eventually my brain will move on after some time has passed.
But this time, I let it go too far.
I fell head over heels in love with the fantasy of being with them. I'd cook up entire novels of delusions. Ruminating over and over. 
I'd feel guilty for giving into it, but would ultimately decide it didn't matter because it was all in my head. Harmless. 
This was a lie. The more I daydream, the more sick I get. I convinced myself I was in love with them. Convinced they were my destiny. So convinced that I almost uprooted my entire life to be with them. 
Instead, I ruined a friendship. A toxic friendship, yes, but I can't deny I had a part to play in it's downfall. 
Now I'm left with the debris. My body has moved on, but my brain still can't let go. I dream of reuniting with them, over and over. They forgive me for all my transgressions, and I forgive them. We hug and cry and decide to try again. 
And that jump starts the cycle. Not as intense, because I am self aware, but still there. In the back of my mind. 
I just want to move on and give my brain a chance to think about something else.
How do I let go and stop thinking about it?",1753717936.0,2025-07-28 15:52:16+00:00,1,2,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbjwbe/rumination_and_infatuation/
1mbjvu2,Today is my birthday and i wanna die,"Sorry this is long but I need to get some things off my chest.

Today i turn 23. I have a lot of suicidal thoughts everyday and i was gonna do it a couple of years ago but didn’t because i got scared.

I was bullied a lot through out my childhood especially that i was a fat kid and sometimes it came to touching in an uncomfortable way, i never told my parents because i was scared to tell them and just kept in and never told nobody in general because i find it extremely hard to tell someone i know.

I never had confidence in any way shape or form and it became much worse when my father passed away a month after my 17th birthday, he passed away due to cancer and he had it for two years and i saw a lot of bad stuff happen to my dad and it was traumatizing in a really bad way. 

At that point i started having suicidal thoughts and it was so difficult because i couldn’t tell my mom because she had enough going on with her and didn’t wanna bother her or my brother (I’m older than my brother) because he too was so depressed and i didn’t find it in my heart to tell him.

I still feel worthless and unloved even though my mom is the best and everything is going great but i still can’t find value in myself. Today when she got me a cake and also made another desert for me I just wanted to cry because i don’t feel like i deserve any of it.

I go to church every Sunday and pray but i don’t feel like I’m a good person to ask god for something so it’s really hard for me and i just feel like a statue standing or sitting in church without any emotion.

I spoke with my son and when my husband came home our son was so excited to see him- he didn’t have any apprehension etc. also we would talk on the phone the whole last week before he came home- so I didn’t quite understand the whole situation.

After the blow out I’ve had several dramatic texts from my mom and sister about how they “always support me” “are especially understanding with me” it all just feels gross and I want to be happy. I don’t want to live in their negative space and have things held above my head when I’m trying to make things work in my own little family. 

My mom loves to mention how she “financially supports” me bc she offered to pay off my car ..I never asked. I don’t accept money from her bc she loves to say look what I did for you.

About a month ago, he opened up to me about his mental health struggles, and I responded with empathy , I told him I understood and thanked him for trusting me. But since then, he has changed. He stopped initiating conversations and only replies when I reach out first. I'm worried he might’ve misunderstood my reaction and thinks I don’t like him anymore, or maybe his condition has gotten worse, since he doesn’t like talking about it much. I really care about him, and I’ve been thinking about opening up to him as well, and maybe sharing a self-help book that helped me when I was struggling. But I’m afraid of making things worse or making him feel uncomfortable. What do you think?

1mbirbh,Adjusting for Love: How Much Is Too Much?,"Sometimes I wonder if my feelings are valid or if I’m just being too demanding. I’m a romantic — I love affection, surprises, symbolic gestures. I’ve been in a serious relationship with my bf, who is South Indian, since November 2022. From the start, I was the one who fought the hardest for us.

We met in Rome during my Erasmus. He warned me that distance and cultural differences made a relationship impossible. But I didn’t give up. I returned to Rome, asked him to be my boyfriend — he said no again. Only after I went back to Madeira did he finally say yes. My family met him early on and, despite initial doubts, gave him a chance because they saw I truly liked him.

I met his mother and sister much later — only because I insisted. He’s always been cautious about his culture’s expectations, sometimes assuming the worst. For example, he feared his mother wouldn’t accept me because I’m European — but she did, and now we talk regularly.

We did five months of long-distance, then I moved to southern Italy for an internship to be closer. When it ended, he came to Madeira — but only because my father invited him. Later, he moved to the Netherlands. I couldn’t find a job there, so I moved to Brussels for an internship to be near him. We agreed to live together once he got a job, but when he did, he changed his mind: we should wait until after marriage, for his family’s sake. I was upset, but I accepted.

So we planned a traditional Indian ceremony for January 2026. Afterward, I’d return to Madeira, finish a 12-month job contract, then move to the Netherlands. But I left that job due to workplace harassment, which changed the timeline. Then he said we should get legally married before living together. I disagreed, saying indian ceremony was enough, and once we live together we would plan madeira cerimony carefully. He resisted but eventually accepted.

Later on, i decided for madeira cerimoney to be march 2026. I asked him to begin the legal paperwork needed for the Madeira ceremony. He said, “Tomorrow, today I want to rest.” Only when he saw I was upset did he start — and now it seems the document will take longer than expected.

And the proposal... I want something symbolic and romantic — not a formality after everything’s planned. He keeps saying it’ll happen before the wedding. But by then, everything will already be arranged. I don’t want to ask for these things. I want him to surprise me, to show desire, to make me feel chosen. But most of the time, I feel like I give more than I get. He admits it and always says, “After the wedding, I’ll give back three times more. Please adjust until then.” But why do I have to keep adjusting?

Even small gestures — like posting a photo of us — he avoids, saying it’s not done in his culture before marriage. “You chose to be with an Indian,” he tells me. “This is the reality.” His family doesn’t share couple photos publicly before marriage — that’s the rule.

But I’ve made so many sacrifices: I returned to Italy, then moved to Brussels, and accepted living in the Netherlands. He’s said outright that if I didn’t want to move there, we wouldn’t work out. It feels like everything is on his terms.

Even when telling his aunts about me, he waited to do it in person. I understand cultural pressure, but I also know my own mother faces judgment and still supports me because she sees my happiness.

Am I being unreasonable? Should I simply accept that this is his way — shaped by culture — or is this just who he is?",1753715350.0,2025-07-28 15:09:10+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbirbh/adjusting_for_love_how_much_is_too_much/
1mbiq0z,M36 I dont want to find out anymore,"So let's start im a m36 and I guess I need to give a bit of background first 
 i was in a 13year relationship wiith a girl who was the same age as me.
 I was abused constantly this ranged from saxually where she would get mad if I sad no and if I did she would just wait till I was asleep so she could do what ever I got woken up more than a few times like this. 
She used to hit scratch bite at one point when I tried to get out the flat away from her she grabbed my hair pulled my down on the stairs put her knee on one side edge of a step on the other and pulling my hair while screaming at me about where do I think im going.
She appeared with a knife one time then stabbed a load of holes in the wall and said next time... wheel stareing at me.
She has im fairly sure spiked me as there has been a few times i felt like I got slammed by a tonne of bricks and soon as I sat down id black out. Extream stalking. Entrapment. Threats. Faking being attacked for anyone who could hears benefit (i did film these for when the police turned up i filmed most interaction because I figured it was the only thing stopping a her word against mine issue (it dident) .

There are meny more but that would be a book it was over a long time after all.

So thats the background or so I thought too 
I have adhd and dyslexia and im not going down the path or treating the adhd to make my life a little easier part of that is therapy and this is where my problem arises 

First issue much as I can rant about what she did to me like above I find hard to atchully hate her or even dislike her some times like i have to read an old message and be like ohhh yeah i remember. I keep finding out more things I dident relise were abusive behaviours that were haplning to me or it makes me remember more about it i get this is or can be part of the healing prosess.

But what is this suppression crap like it turned out I was s/a as a child but would to of appeared to not relised it or what ever reason I dident tell im not sure but I remember it vividly now and I really dont want to. 

I've really had both sides of the coin growing up and I guess ive just used to taking 
The good with the bad and my dad was a military hard ass so I got a lot of ill give u something to cry about ect. 

Me and my dad ha e reconciled all of this so that part is fine just a hit more background. 

Im just getting worried about finding out more how am I forgetting or blocking this stuff.

Its affecting the way I think everytime I find something out its killing me inside. 
Im not sure how to pose a question here except those who have found out stuff like this or delt with suppression and its starts coming out how do you deal with your own head at this point 

she died she according the the coroner's report she was in the region of 4x the drink drive limit ( this was said for us to understand how much was there as apposed to the mil of alachol to mg of blood) and drowned in the bath when this happened I had been out the house and separated for about a few months o was never told I found out a day before her frunal and when I called her mother the whole thing was slammed on me the death was listed as missadventure

1mbi7o0,"My whole life is based around the problems others around me have had, and accommodating how they feel.","It's difficult to sort of express exactly how I feel, which is why the title is so wordy.

And this post is unlikely to be seen, I don't know, no one ever seems to read these.

I just feel shitty about my life at present. I've come to realize its less of my own issues, my ""own"" problems in life, but rather the problems I deal with indirectly, which are those of the people around me.

I know this might sound shitty, as if I expect people to be all rainbows and sunshine. Which I don't. But I just wish they'd make time for how I feel too, or maybe make me feel like I atleast matter some to them, when things are alright for them.

For the most part of my childhood, my parents were (and are) at odds, staying together for the kids. In a way, they did things for me, but I also have to deal with their complexes. I never got to live a childhood like the rest of my friends did, which I don't have complaints about; I have a better life than most nevertheless.

I have very few friends. One guy friend and my girlfriend. When the former hit a rough patch, he didn't talk to me much, which I understand. I just felt really bad on days when I wanted someone to give me company for an hour on a walk. When my girlfriend goes through something, she has a tendency to hit out at me.

When I go through something, I don't say anything to anyone, because I know they either can't do anything about it, or that they'll get hurt, or maybe they'll get offended. It's not a good coping strategy either, but I can't have rough days. I just can't, because someone will be hurt or feel helpless or whatever. I just rush through the days. I rush through life. And some days it comes crashing down on me, and all I can do is feel like I'm alone and I'm bound to be alone.

How can I do that?","I grew up and recently graduated in a rural K-12 school and felt within school that I was always the lesser by the student body that was there. I felt there wasn't a lot of opportunities for my high school and that my college readiness is pretty subpar as well, I had a high GPA but didn't do exactly well on SAT or even SAT readiness which my school was trying to push towards. What was also subpar was the social dynamics of the school and within the educational dynamics I was constantly being dealt low quality hands with me not being at the top. I wasn't a popular sports player, valedictorian, or even a member of an honor society that I was invited to. I wanted time for me and the people in my life because I was just me and wasn't interested in those aspects of my education at the time. There isn't anything wrong with that.

Even though I know these things, I can't seem to convince my mind that I will be anything less than a subpar person.

I'm not; I loathe myself so much, I hate my physical appearance, I think my personality is annoying, I don't know why anyone would want to be around me? These thoughts don't ever go away and part of me wants to withdraw from everyone and just sit in my room and wait for death. I play DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) usually each week but more and more I'm just like ""I pretty much feel like I fucked this up for everyone"" so I want to just be like ""No I'm not coming anymore"" 

I've also started drinking heavily again, I don't care what happens to my body, I just keep wishing for death nearly every day. Yes I'm already on antidepressants I'm also on an antipsychotic drug too but honestly doesn't seem to get rid of this depression.

Ontop of this, my friends hate the way I describe myself or when I talk about myself in any negativity, like cmon open your eyes, I'm just speaking truth.

Also, pretty pathetic but I got my first boyfriend at 27, he broke up with me and now I'm just like ""what's the point of a relationship?"" It just seems like it comes with me putting a partner through a lot of pain when they can do so much better than me.

1mbhia4,"Sibling with concerning long-term mental health issues, and my own mental health","I (28F) have a sibling that has made concerning statements about her mental health for a long time; but lately it's really starting to wear on me. Not sure what I want to do. 

When I say a long time, I mean a long time. I've spent much of my life worrying about her. We both had it rough growing up. I've seen her get multiple prescriptions for anxiety through a psychiatrist, I'm not sure if she does talk therapy or anything like that. We don't have much of a support group or supportive family, and our father passed away about a year ago- the only parent we were close to. 

I've watched her make not exactly the best choices in life, and feeble (or late) attempts to help herself. I.e. covering herself in piercings and tattoos before having a stable career/income plan for the next few years. She's been at the same job with unstable hours for several years, and is currently in place to chase what she really wants to do, but it's a hard grind. 

She lives with someone of whom I know doesn't really  offer her any emotional stability and I think he resents her because she is not able to pay towards any bills and essentially feels she has nowhere else to go. 

It's just extra hard on me to hear her tell me that she considered writing goodbye letters the other day. I've been struggling myself; big time since our Dad died. I'm really pushing myself lately to fight and feel my way out of a depression with a full time office job that takes up a decent portion of my life. 

Recently, she has tried a special drug therapy trial for treatment-resistant depression; I don't know if she still does that or if it even helps. She has said so many things to me over the past several years implying that she's dangerously close to snapping, and she's the only close family I have. Lately, since our Dad is gone and she's gotten more descriptive with these ""warnings"" (?); I feel more and more overwhelmed.

I’m angry today and it’s annoying. Sometimes I wake up and feel like war! I want to fight everybody, and my patience is nonexistent. You don’t think fast enough, you don’t know something, or you just annoy me in some way. I make sure that you feel it. It’s not only in my private life, but also at work. I’m verbally quick and strong, and I know my stuff because I’ve forced as much knowledge as possible down my throat since childhood. 

I have this obsession with understanding EVERYTHING (which is impossible, of course but I need to know). I don’t know why I’m telling you this, but maybe it helps you understand the bigger picture. 

Anyway, the worst thing is, I get away with it, because I have this “invincible” status at work, same in my private life (though less invincible). Overall, I’m a good human and I care for everybody, Iam often the ""glue"" that keeps people together without being the front man or anything. I nearly never complain with choices etc. 

I help everyone at work and am usually patient. Also, I don’t judge which is a huge thing, especially when it comes to outsiders. I treat everybody the same.

1mbg8zp,I hate myself.,"

I turn 20 next week, but I am not excited for my birthday. It’s not just the number that scares me. It’s the day itself. A 20th birthday should be celebrated at a club with a big friend group or maybe a surprise party that they arranged, but it’s not going to be like that for me. 

I have never been to a club, the young adult in me wants to go, but the me doesn’t. Too loud, too many people, I’d rather just stay home. Staying at home doesn’t help me achieve anything though. I can count the times I’ve done something special in the past few years on one hand. I have never done anything that makes me truly happy, I only do things that keep me satisfied, just to maybe one time feel something a little more than just regular. 

I can’t believe the result of my teenage years is that I hate myself and anything I’ve ever done. I have two friends. One of them is on the other side of the world, living her dream- our dream actually- just that she’s doing it and I’m just dreaming about it and never even gave myself the chance to do it.

I try to blame the pandemic, but it’s been years since it ended and it affected ALL people my age. Everyone lost those two or three years, but they all moved on now and I never did. 

I still feel the same way. I still like the same things basically. All that changed is my age and that now instead of high school, I am in college. But I am still that same fifteen year old child. 

I want to do all these teenage or young adult things like having my first kiss, going on vacation with friends, partying, relationships and everything, but apparently I don’t. If I did, I would actually do them. I don’t even like these things, I just want to observe them with the dream that one day I might be that way, just so I could be a little proud of myself. 

I try to believe in something. That I’m a good person, that there is something out there that wants good and that is rooting for me. That something is watching over me and guiding me, but there probably isn’t. It’s just me and it’s always going to be me and I will never be able to achieve anything.

I am currently in the 3rd year at IISER-M and had 3 baclogs during the start of the fourth semester and in the fourth semester my girlfriend whom i was from the start of my college life(and man she was the one really) just said that she doesn't feel anymore for me and doesn't even like to spend time with me. My mental health was so fucked up by this that i didn't even bother to study and at the end got 4 more backlogs(there were total 5 courses in the semester). I know you can thought that i was making excuses that i can't study but really it was so much bad. Then now comes the summer semester and inthis we were ment to do an internship but i didn't got one so i lied to my parents about it and stayed in the campus for a whole of 3 months and was also clearing by backlogs. Now 4 are left at the end of the semester. Remember i told about getting 4 backlogs in the 4th semester that result i altred and send to my parents and they now thought all my backlogs are cleared cuz i showed them taht i got none. But today the post from the college came and they got to know about it.

1mbfjme,Finding Professional Help as a Dependent with Unsupportive Parents,"I'm 24 and am currently working for a certificate in order to become independent in the future with my own place, as I come from a family of Christians who are transphobic, biphobic, homophobic and have on and off opinions around mental health. I am detangling from Christianity and am also bisexual, and can't safely tell anyone but close friends I trust. 

My parents in the past paid for a psychiatrist for me, and I was super grateful for it, but the psychiatrist has since retired. My parents paid for this, yes, but there have been times where they've guilted me for not telling them what I say in there, then told me it's my own business and then questioned the medication they have given me while emphasizing fear in what this could mean for me taking it. I have once caught my mum eavesdropping on my counselling meeting and when confronted, she guilt-tripped me for not talking to her and never apologised. They have in the past tried to instill fear of what he'll give me, or diagnose me with, and in one memorable event advised me to not talk to professionals as they could ""sedate me and strap me to a bed"". 

My psychiatrist has told me that I show signs for being diagnosed potentially for OCD with psychotic features, which basically means that my insight into believing my intrusive thoughts can slide from knowing they're just intrusive thoughts to believing in them in high stress situations. When this does happen, I have absolutely no one to go to, and my safest option is to close doors and either pace or lie restlessly with these thoughts till they pass. 

I have sexual intrusive thoughts that I'm mostly convinced at this point guarantee that I need extreme professional help in the near future. I am a prisoner to my thoughts all day, every day, and hate myself profusely - and my family would rather I pretend to be okay and force myself through episodes, so I can be like everyone else and have a job, get married and not be ""lazy"" or ""childish"". 

I've had multiple bad episodes where I've almost called someone and been left in a state where I'm so exhausted mentally, all I remember is pacing and leaning my head on walls and nothing helping, all while hiding myself from family so they don't pass judgement or try to convince me I'm okay when I'm not. 

I have no job, the last two jobs I tried left me either passing out in the hallway with shaky wrists that lasted for days, or made me relapse and have an episode believing that I was harming cardboard boxes. My family is contradictive but overall do not want to understand, and calling for help feels like if I do, my parents will be humiliated and therefore shame me for asking for help or guilt me for not telling them first. 

How do I get help? How do I move out, get a financially stable job AND get therapy alongside it, crossing my fingers that the next job doesn't leave me in a similar state? I feel alone and stuck and scared. I don't know what to do - I'm dependent and no longer can take my medication, which I only take in emergencies as I don't have an endless supply anymore. What to I do?

It may help me cope but it still hurts me knowing those characters are just made up and all that i really have is myself, I hate being a loser who fantasizes about having friends. I really really wish they were real.

1mbfh13,"I opened up about my mh and now I feel guilty, what should I do?","TW: Might talk about sh and su!c!dal thoughs

This is gonna be a long one so buckle up.

So, I think I might have undiagnosed adhd and depression for like years now, and I've just recently opened up to my mother about the adhd (I didn’t tell her about the depression because I honestly don't have a valid reason as to why I think I have it, but I do know having sewersidal and sh thoughts are not normal). 

So now, we're trying to make an appointment with a psychiatrist—which is so much more harder than I thought cuz all the vacant times are either weeks away or the doctor is just out of town. And I don't think I can handle waiting another month or so or else not only will my grades plummet but also my social life and my.

My mother has been so patient with the appointment making tho. She has contacted several psychiatrists and tried to make appointments. She even flew here to the city from the province (I moved to the city for my senior years in highschool and am currently living with my aunt) just to be able to accompany me to my first session.

But recently, the appointment we made with the psychiatrist was moved to the date that my mother is supposed to go back to the province. So, she got stressed cuz not only did they already agree on a convenient date and just decided to change it last minute, but also because now we have to look for another psychiatrist that will take me before her flight. 

So me being me—seeing how my mom got so stressed, her BP rising and all—i cried. There, on the spot. I just felt so so guilty. If I wasn't like this, then she wouldn't have to stress so much on top of everything else she's already stressing about. And now, I really do just feel like a burden. It's gotten so bad to the point that I was researching stuff that i shouldn't even be researching, one in which I haven't thought of doing in years. I wouldn't do it of course since it'll just be more expenses for her if it works or not. I just really feel guilty that she was given a kid like me. If I was normal, she wouldn't have to suffer like this too. 

So like, I just wanna ask on what can I do to ease this guilt and help my mom as well. It's just been so hard that it's even affecting my academics—the only thing that I have to put effort on but can't even do so anymore...",1753707516.0,2025-07-28 12:58:36+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbfh13/i_opened_up_about_my_mh_and_now_i_feel_guilty/

1mbf3no,"Why is it still so hard for men to talk about emotions, sex, and mental health?","Unfortunately, I see a strong pattern—especially among boys and men—where it’s really difficult to open up about personal things like emotions, sex life, self-esteem, and mental well-being. It feels like something we’ve inherited from previous generations. A pattern that’s deeply ingrained and incredibly hard to break.

Men often have fewer close relationships, fewer regular social plans, and smaller support networks—which makes us extra vulnerable when life gets tough. That’s when our survival mechanisms kick in. We escape into hobbies, chase women or sex, or turn to alcohol… sometimes even drugs.

That said, I do think something is starting to shift—especially among younger guys. In certain spaces, it’s becoming more okay to speak up. To share our vulnerability without fear of being mocked, shamed, or seen as “less of a man.”

But change is slow.

I’ve been going through a really difficult season emotionally separation, job instability, and a lot of internal turmoil. I had started feeling like I was finally getting back on my feet: journaling, gym, even finding moments of clarity. But recently, I relapsed into drinking again badly.

I don’t know if it’s addiction or a lack of self-control, but I feel like I’m losing grip. After each episode, I’m left with shame, anxiety, and a deep sadness that doesn’t seem to go away. I’ve been through therapy before, and I genuinely want to heal but right now, I’m struggling.

Has anyone been here where you thought you were making progress and then fell hard again? How did you get back up?

No judgment, just looking for honest advice or insight.

1mbf154,DBT training advice,"Hello all, I’m coming off a divorce and a failed relationship. There was a lot of problems in both, drinking and doing coke was a problem and I don’t handle my emotions well when I’m not sober. I have cut that out of my life. But I grew up in a toxic household where name calling and vocal abuse was normal. Where my step dad would call anyone anything, come home and throw shoes at us, yell at us for doing the smallest thing wrong, belittle us. I often was the protector of the other kids and I was his step kid, I was told I wasn’t loved as much as the other kids. And I would often yell back at him and call him nasty names as well. It was normal and I was not taught healthy boundaries and relationships. That has transformed into my adult life. Sober, I’m calm cool and collected, very affectionate and make my spouse feel safe. But if I feel threatened or attacked, I lash out. Not let the other person have space and want to solve the problem in two seconds And say things I don’t mean, sober, this isn’t very often, but it can happen. I know drinking just isn’t an option anymore for me, and I’ve accepted that and I’m ok with it.  but I don’t want to ever raise my voice to anyone ever again. This is really only towards  a spouse, I don’t yell outside of a relationship or to kids.

1mbelq9,I made sexual jokes to and in front of people who were younger than me and I can’t forgive myself.,"For context, I’m 18, my friend is 16 (We have a 2 year 1 month age gap) I’ve known him online for around 3 years. In that time, we’ve made inappropriate and sexual jokes towards each other.

I’ve recently realised how wrong it was and frankly feel fucking awful. I thought we had a smaller age gap (maybe like less than 2 years) but even then I always thought less than 3 years was the limit when it came to shit like that.

I’ve apologised to him, he says he has no issue with it whatsoever and that we’re fine (I’m 19, he’s 17 now).

Another reason I feel so guilty, is because I also made a few inappropriate jokes in front of others. When I was 18, I was playing VrChat and I joined 2 peers and we were joking about a porn game the other was playing. A 12 year old that one of them knew joined, I felt uncomfortable but I can’t remember what I said in front of them, I think I asked if a certain character was in the game and made a joke about the other guy supporting what he loves. I think I thought the 12 year old left at certain points and thats why I felt comfortable making those jokes. Afterwards, I told my friend we shouldn’t have those types of discussions in front of him again.

I also joined one of them in a VrChat Smash Or Pass game, in which other minors were present, because I wanted to hang out with him and thought that since he was there it was okay for me to be there. I silently voted, made a joke that I like what I like after choosing smash for a weird character, and humped the screen a few times as a joke. It was jokes I made in the heat of the moment.

Finally, while playing a prison game in VrChat a 16 year old I knew (I was 18 and we had a 2 year 6 month age gap) dropped the soap and I breathed loudly behind him. I didn’t know we had such a large age gap and thought he was a peer but I still shouldn’t have.

I should note I later cut off both of my peers for saying extremely inappropriate shit to the 12 year old and reported them.

The reason why I ask is because even though I know this was wrong, I don’t know if it’s unforgivable or not. I can’t live life feeling like I’m some disgusting dangerous person.

1mbelca,i can’t keep helping my ex every. single. time.,"my (13nb) ex (13f) broke up with me in april over text, she basically said that i’m too good for her. she really struggles with her mental health, she has for as long as i’ve known her. she’s already tried to kill herself once, and i’ve reported her mom for child abuse to the school twice and nothing has happened as far as i know. she regularly texts me, usually in the middle of the night when i’m asleep, asking if she’s enough or if she should just kill herself, and every time i have to scramble to cobble together a bunch of lies and false promises and pray to whatever the fuck is listening that it’s enough to keep her alive for now. she just texted me that she’s gonna cut her wrists soon. i still haven’t opened the text, im considering deleting the messaging app altogether. 

i can’t keep doing this. i have my own problems to deal with, albeit not as much as hers. my grandma keeps berating my parents for not being up to her standards of a middle class family, im still questioning my gender and my whole family except my dad is pretty transphobic, i’m autistic and got bullied a lot for it last year, i’m pretty sure i might have developed cPTSD from it. i already have to tell MYSELF not to kill or cut myself semi-regularly, it’s hard enough without having to do it for her too. 

I just don’t know what to do. if i tell her not to contact me again, i’m almost certain she’s gonna try to kill herself again, and who knows if she’ll be successful this time. if i keep doing this, it’s gonna keep destroying me and who knows if i can keep telling me self not to kill or cut myself for much longer like this. i just don’t know what to do",1753705015.0,2025-07-28 12:16:55+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbelca/i_cant_keep_helping_my_ex_every_single_time/
1mbeixm,Trying to figure out my life,"TLDR: 25M with little to no friends and no luck with dating. Very introverted and prefer being away from people which is then causing the loneliness.

I, 25M, feel extremely alone at times. I have had some friends over the years but it has always been based on having to see them every day at school. Now that I’m out of school, I’ve drifted away from pretty much everyone I called a friend and barely keep in touch with anyone. I always focused on school and never really any sort of social events as I often wasn’t invited or I was busy the one time I was asked.

I am also introverted and work a job where my social battery is drained frequently so I typically prefer just chilling at home and watching Netflix or YouTube to pass the time. Lately I have been self conscious about this making my life boring. I am doing taekwondo as well twice a week but when I’m not working or at taekwondo I sit at home and just rot.

I have also been trying to explore dating. I was with a girl for a month a year ago who was very unwell mentally and I thought we could help each other as we both were “broken”. Unfortunately she just made my mental health worse and we eventually broke up.

I am now trying to explore dating and started talking to this girl. Since it was the first serious match in a long time I put all my emotion into her and hoped this would be the one. We had good chemistry at first but she would respond once a day, and now once every two days, which caused the emotions and momentum to die. She wanted to start as friends and see where things go. I am now worried that maybe she is already moving on with other guys as she has been posting herself at different events and has had her followers count on insta go up every now and then.

I am definitely overthinking a lot of this but need to get this off my chest as I’m in a really low place right now and need someone to hear me.

1mbei5o,Is it normal to revisit painful memories on purpose just to feel worse?,"I’ve noticed I sometimes intentionally think about the most painful experiences of my life, especially at night. It’s not a flashback — it’s voluntary. I go back there to feel pain.

I asked a small group, and the majority said they’ve done the same thing.

It feels self-destructive, like emotional self-harm. But maybe there’s more to it?

Why do we do this? What’s the psychological reason? Have you talked about this in therapy?

I’d love to hear from others who’ve experienced it and maybe found some insight or peace.",1753704755.0,2025-07-28 12:12:35+00:00,4,1,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbei5o/is_it_normal_to_revisit_painful_memories_on/
1mbehyl,"Need advice, how to support someone and I have some questions. Please read. Thank you.","My boyfriend, who has Aspergers(very high functioning) struggles with alcohol, he’s not a daily drinker it’s more of a “binge” when he does. Well when we first met we were both child free, young, got our first house but both suffered mental health issues. He is diagnosed anxiety and depression and he took a seizure due to the alcohol at this point we were drinking everyday but this was years ago and long forgotten, since the seizures when he is drunk. He doesn’t seem to have to drink allot either, he had 2 pints of beer and drank 3 cans 8% on the way home which was a 2 hour walk. When he got home he didn’t know who I was he thought I was his brother and kept trying to get me on a bus to go home? (I was in my house) he was fully convinced I had been out at the pub with him and his brother when I wasn’t, I was at home with the dogs and had been texting him so he knew this anyway. But the switch just flips constantly he was so so angry with me one second then his face will complete change and he’s telling me he loves me then he will be really sad then happy in a matter of seconds/minutes. He has decided to stay sober because this is really affecting both of us now. My question is, does he have underlying psychosis that is brought out by alcohol or is this alcohol induced triggering an episode. I ment to add, he wakes up the next day and doesn’t remember pretty much anything and is exhausted physically days after, not a hangover just exhausted completely.

It got to the point where I couldn't stand or see straight because my panic attack was so bad. After my panic attack, I was left tingling all over especially my hands, feet and sides of my face.

1mbe61j,I don’t want to go out of my home at any cost.,"I’m 16F, I’ve been bullied when I was 11-13 so maybe that’s why I feel like that. I’m not diagnosed.

I just feel pathetic. Like subhuman. I’m ashamed to exist and go out with my face.
Even when I’m dressed the best I think it’s too much. When I’m dressed poorly I think I don’t have a right to go out.

Every time in public I overthink, my heart starts beating to fats, everything seems too loud, my hand are dripping in sweat, and my armpits and my feet. All of my body. 

I can’t function in public. 

Every time I think about people my age getting a job, I think of myself not being able to do it, because I have really sweaty hands.

I’m afraid of wearing some clothes because it will show my sweaty armpits. My life is a hell, I’m not able to do anything with my sweaty body, especially sweaty hands.

I’ve tried to go to psychologist(I’ve begged my parents for 2 years to go to) and I was really disappointed, because it wasn’t going anywhere, I felt like I rented a “good friend” to have with her shallow conversations. Maybe I’ve been here only 3 times, but it made me feel really bad and worse and helpless.

I would like to be diagnosed or something but also my parent are weird about it. Like saying “oh I wish I’d go to a psychologist with all of my problems” like mocking me. 

I’ve stopped going to my karate classes because of my sweaty feet and sweaty footprints they left. I don’t do a lot of things because of it. I wish I could function as a normal human being.

I’ve had ambitions but after I shake at the desk, and not knowing how to solve a math shit problem with my sweaty hands, shaky legs and hands. Holding my sweaty math book.

I have 3 people in school who I talk with. But honest they are boring and I only do it because it makes me less anxious, like minimum bearable level. They started talking to me first. And I never talked with others in my school.

And I tried to do something about my sweaty hands. I was at the doctors and she said to take a blood test and when it turned out to be okay she said there is nothing I can do about it. I asked my parent to take me to another one because it’s ruining my life and they said that we have been to a doctor already and if we go again they will say the same thing.

And it gets worse with every year. So I don’t know how I will handle this school year, and I cry and I don’t want to.

And I always play it cool, don’t show it, act like the closest to normal human being I can, and nobody knows I feel anxious and I won’t tell anyone, though after i return from mall or school, I just sit in my room staring at wall and cry about it.",1753703774.0,2025-07-28 11:56:14+00:00,1,2,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbe61j/i_dont_want_to_go_out_of_my_home_at_any_cost/
1mbdzjo,I think my Mum’s mental health has been declining recently,"TW: mention of d3ath There’s an extremely low chance of this getting back to anyone close to me to make things awkward but I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible. I am a 22 year old woman still living at home with my parents (Dad 66 & Mum 58) Mental health struggles are of no stranger to my family, particularly my Mum’s side, with her brother, a cousin and both parents struggling throughout their lives and spending time in psych wards and my uncle committing “s word” earlier this year. My mum has dealt with depression for essentially her entire adult life as far as I know, it’s not my business to share stories. Mind you some background context, my parents don’t have a great marriage, no abuse or cheating or anything like that. It’s just that I see them more as business partners rather than people that have been together for over 35 years. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 18 months ago. My mum is really understanding and supportive, which is refreshing considering mental health is usually quite a taboo topic to people her age it seems. Even before I was diagnosed myself, I noticed behaviour of hers that were ringing alarms bells in my head that she was struggling with a similar thing, more intense than the mild depression she already suffered. Some symptoms I have noticed include extreme energy shifts, she goes through a phase where she wants to go out exercising and running and is very sociable, to shutting down like a switch was flicked to quiet, wanting to stay inside (which is not really her) and extremely low energy. We fight a little bit, nothing too crazy, just mother/daughter stuff, but she gets angry quite fast and switches to extreme sadness, and then is suddenly extremely happy soon after. She also barely sleeps. She has voiced su1c1dal thoughts to me before and then within minutes you wouldn’t have thought a person acting like her would feel that way. She puts a funny, confident, always happy front on in front of others, but I see her struggle when she’s behind closed doors. As I am an only child too, I have an amazing relationship with my Mum, I love her so much. I really want her to talk to a doctor or something as I’m really getting worried.

1mbduh3,"Darkness, my only home","Darkness, My Only Home

The doors open, and the shadows creeps in,
The gloomy nights that pin me in,
No path to see, no hope to begin.

All light ceases to exist as the darkness engulfs our existence,
The grim reaper reaping at a distance.
It's me sitting at the windowsill,
Sitting sadly, holding sleeping pills.
Death staring at me from a distance,
The light begins to fade in an instant.

The countless stories left to be told,
As the final glimmer of hope turns gold.
No breath left to take, no soul left to save;
The pathway ends—nothing left to pave.
Falling and and becoming my minds slave
We all sit down in a pool of our tears,
When there is no one left to hear.
We plead, we bleed, we fall,
As the final beams of light stall.

It’s me with the darkness holding my hand,
The reaper looks at me as I stand.
I fall down and land in his hands,
His embrace is cold, yet feels so light,
Wrapping around me like the depth of the night.

I wake up from the haunting nightmare,
Trying to find the noise or so i dare.
I can't feel like anyone cares,
Yonder light shines its last beam,
As everything I touch turns into steam.
The rope staring into my soul,
As I stumble and look for a pole.
I fall and weep, as the rope slowly puts me to sleep.
My breath grows weak; my thoughts turn grim,
Drowning in whispers, my vision dims.

I wake up in a room of nothing; my body feels like a burden.
I am lost in the thoughts; my mind is a hurdle.
Voices in my ears get louder and louder it seems, as the souls begin to fray,
There is nothing left to say.
The voices in my head sound so eerie,
A choir of demons, whispers so clearly
My final attempt—a Hail Mary.

A call from the void, unanswered weary
As my eyes open and I regain my vision, I see;
I see myself lying on my deathbed,
Covered with bandages upto my head.
Blood pooling beneath my eyes,
All I see is red—my demise.

The sounds of the machines catch my attention,
The nurses on top of me attempting resuscitation.
The machine makes a continuous sound;
I see myself lying there, dead on the ground.

The beam of light halts its stride,
I cower down and hide,
Yet it calls my name, pulling me near,
A voice so soft, yet filled with fear.

This is the story of my dark past,
As I lay there and turn into ash.
Death became my home; my mind took its toll,
As my mind took a stroll.
Now I sit here in my grave,
With nothing left to save.
With a degrading state,
Watching the clock tick, sealing my fate.",1753702766.0,2025-07-28 11:39:26+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbduh3/darkness_my_only_home/

1mbdtft,Its me my mind,"

The abyss swallows me whole—my mind pays the toll.
Light fades as the gloom takes over; I drift in an empty rover.
The voices in my head begin to rise; all I hear is death—my demise.
The shadows stare deep into my soul; I don't know if I can take this anymore.
I stand at the crossroads, left alone to begin—
All I have left is this grim skin.
No souls remain to speak; I stand alone on this empty peak,
I reach for a hand, but the chains in my mind pull me deep.
Drowning in silence, too broken to shriek.

When the clock strikes midnight, my mind starts to roll,  
It halts its steps, searching for someone whole.  
It steadily gets harder to stay afloat,  
Just like a sinking boat.  

Everything I do just turns out wrong,  
It’s getting harder to stay strong.  
All light fades down a darkened path,  
It all just feels like an acid bath.  

It’s steadily growing harder to hold on,  
I reach for the truth, but it's always a con.  
The thoughts rush in faster than before,  
I can’t do anything but endure.  

The gates open as the voices consume me whole,  
I stumble and look for someone to hold.  
A subtle gloominess in the night,  
All I can do is just hide.  

The growls start to get louder, it seems;  
Oh, it's Freddy—what a scheme.  
The voices start to speak to me, it feels,  
It's getting harder to heal.  

They start to talk to my lifeless soul,  
I am just someone with a gaping hole.  
My shattered mind speaks louder to me, it's true,  
I can never make it to see the light’s view.  

I’ll never be enough, I'll never make it far,  
I feel like cracked strings on a guitar.  
I am the one no one wishes to be,  
All they wish is to flee.  

No one wants me for who I am,There is nothing left in this broken jam.  
All I hear is the voice of the reaper—it reaps,  
I'll be dead in the dust before the sun shines its beam.  

I am worthless; a waste of space,  
No one wants me to be in their place.  
My eyes get heavy, and I pass out cold,  
Maybe this is the end—I cannot hold.  

They are still watching; they never sleep,  
They are always watching over the heaps.  
I cannot flee,  
All they wanted was someone as vulnerable as me.  

Outside the window, they watch my every move,  
They want to take me—to prove.  

Their eerie smiles steal my breath,  
Choking me closer to my death.  
They will be staring at me from behind,  
And the moment I look away—I’ll be dead before sunrise.  

Eyes so dark, they resemble the void,  
They play with my thoughts—oh, how they enjoyed.  
Three of them wait outside, nowhere to hide,  
They will find me and consume me whole,  
That’s their ultimate goal.  

This was the story of a messed-up mind,  
There really isn’t anything left to hide.  
I might not even make it through this night,

1mbd0le,"Is what I’m doing normal, or is something wrong with me? Feeling stuck, numb, and always overthinking","

Hello. I’m honestly just trying to figure out what’s going on with me. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes very emotional. I’ve become emotionally distant from my family, and lately, I’ve been extremely lazy — even though deep down I know I should be doing something to help myself.

For example,  I scroll on my phone a lot and listen to phonk music, imagining myself as a kind of “hero” or “savior” — like a leader everyone admires. It gives me a rush, but also feels like I’m escaping from real life.

I’m in therapy, and I’ve tried reducing screen time, but I always fall back into the same pattern — 6 to 7 hours on my phone. I know I’m the only one who can really help myself, but I still feel tired and unwilling, like I’m stuck in a victim mindset.

This year, I skipped a lot of school. I also have anemia and haven’t been taking my iron or vitamins — I just kind of ignore it, even though I know it’s bad. Everything feels like a task or duty, even basic things like cleaning my room or doing homework. I feel like my family sees me as lazy and irresponsible.

Another strange thing: I spend hours every day thinking, analysing everything — events, movies, books, friendships, my past trauma. Today i was watching ""girl, interuppted"" and again analysing and analysing different disorders. Then thinking ""do i have empathy"" ""do i do like her"". Also  I imagine that I’m talking to a psychologist in my head, explaining my emotions and what happened. Even small things, I replay in my mind like I’m telling a story. Then I realize I’m thinking about the same things again and then I start thinking about thinking. It feels exhausting — like my brain never stops. It’s like I’m always narrating life instead of living it.

Now I’m on summer break, and I’m supposed to decide on my future. I’m torn between two paths: psychology or engineering.
Psychology could help me understand myself, but I’m not sure if I really want to listen to people’s problems every day.
Engineering might give me financial stability and help me numb my emotions — but it feels too robotic.

But even thinking about researching these careers feels like another task I don’t want to do. I avoid it.

I wonder if others feel like this too — constantly analysing everything, detached from real life, living inside their heads, tired even when doing nothing, unsure what they want, unable to move forward.
Also, I worry sometimes that I’m narcissistic or lack empathy — like, am I exaggerating my problems or missing something?

If anyone out there has felt something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing your experience. I feel like no one in my life really understands this. Thank you for reading.

1mbd0j6,I’ve lost my libido for over a year after antipsychotics — I don’t know if it will ever come back,"I’m posting this because I don’t know where else to talk about it. It’s been over a year now that I’ve completely lost my libido. No sexual desire, no arousal, no interest in anything. It’s just… gone.

I’ve taken multiple antipsychotics over the years — different types, different doses. I think I’ve been massively overmedicated. I’m starting to believe what I went through wasn’t just “treatment,” but actual medical abuse. I was put on a cocktail of meds that wrecked my nervous system, and no one ever warned me this could happen. But that’s not even the main point of this post.

What’s killing me now is not knowing if my sexuality will ever come back. I feel like a ghost of who I was. I can’t connect with people in the same way. It’s like the core part of being human has been shut off. And doctors just say “it’s in your head” or “give it time,” but no one gives real answers.

I’m terrified this is permanent.

Have any of you gone through this? Has anyone recovered after this long? I really want to hear your experiences — even the hard ones. I need to know I’m not the only one, and I need to understand what’s possible.

1mbcsuj,"I can't stand my depressive mom, i'm starting to hate her. Any advice ?","Sorry in advance for any mistakes english is not my first language, and this will be a lot of venting.

So, my mom has been depressed for 2 years already (it's been diagnosed, she's seeing two psychiatrists and is on medication), at first i was supportive but now im starting to resent her a lot.

Honestly i don't feel like she's my mom anymore. She does nothing but sleep all the time, she's been on sick leave for the past two years (you can do that in my country, she's just less paid ; she hasn't been fired because she works for the government, she doesn't have a ""direct"" boss so her absence doesn't have that much of an impact) ; the few times her doctor tried to end her sick leave she went back to work for a few hours before going back home, claiming it's too soon or that she has a headache or whatever excuse she comes up with, then she asks the doctor to extend her sick leave. She never tries to push through. Same for her anti depressant, her psychiatrists tried to reduce the dosage progressively in an attempt to stop them a year and a half ago ; after two days she said that the few withdrawal effects were too much for her so she went back to the old dosage, to this day she never tried again to reduce it.

She's always home but does nothing around the house, so all the chores are falling on me, my dad and my siblings although we are all working/going to school. For the first few months we were supportive, but after two years all the tensions and resentment we all feel are suffocating. My father isn't far away from the burn out, but she couldn't care less. If he tries to speak gently to her, no improvement, is he ""screams"" at her, she'll laugh at his face like it's the funniest thing ever (for example, she wanted to go on a vacation so we went ; in my family we deep clean the house before going, like usual she did nothing but sleeping, so after a few days of asking nicely my dad was honestly desperate and told her kinda angrily to wake up and start doing something, she laughed at his face saying that she did her part, pointing to the open (but empty) suitcase on the bed). It's like she's doing everything she can to push him to the limit, then she'll randomly start crying saying that my dad he's going to divorce her even if he assured her multiple times that he won't (even if sometines i wish he did, i just want a peaceful home without all the tensions).

The few times she's not sleeping she's kinda zonning out, like you have to call her multiple times for her to listen, even if she's right next to you. Sometimes you also have to repeat yourself multiple times for her to understand what you're saying/asking (i think it's her medication). It's like talking to a damn zombie.

I'm really starting to resent her because our family is falling apart because of her. Two fcking years feels like a really long time to me. I don't want to be insensitive but i feel like if she wanted to improve, she would have already. She's not pushing through, she's letting herself exist and she doesn't care. I feel like i tried everything (the long emotional talks, screaming at her, leaving her alone, being by her side, proposing to go out or do activites, ...). I know it's not her fault but i'm just too resentful to care at this point.

Idk if this is relevant but i've also been depressed at some point (diagnosed), so i can understand her to an extent. I know the anger i feel is not rational.

Any advice of how to get ride of these feelings ?",1753699341.0,2025-07-28 10:42:21+00:00,2,2,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbcsuj/i_cant_stand_my_depressive_mom_im_starting_to/

1mbc4gy,anxiety and ocd,"Is it possible to turn anxiety into OCD? I’m worried I’ve transformed my anxiety into ‘small’ OCD. Hopefully this isn’t possible and I’m just being anxious about being anxious haha.

I used to have incredibly bad anxiety, like 1-10 crying, debilitating panic attacks a day and in the past few years I’ve felt it be less prominent and I haven’t had any panic attacks (to that scale at least) in over a year.

However, recently I catch myself stuck on a thought until I do something to release it - and I understand this is the premise of OCD but I think it was my way of coping with anxieties however it’s now became an issue that I have to confront because it isn’t a coping mechanism anymore, it bugs me and ruins things.

It can be as small as: if I think about eating something I have to eat it otherwise I can’t stop thinking about it (I used to have a restrictive ED so I think this one stems from that). To as big as (rather ironically) thinking once that I could have OCD and now thinking multiple times a day “maybe I have OCD” and it probably won’t go away until I get a professional evaluation but I can’t afford to go private and with the NHS I imagine I’d be waiting ages.

There’s another huge thought that I’m really stuck on atm but I don’t want to share it because even talking about it makes me spiral really hard :(

Some other small thoughts: sort of knowing I locked the door but not being able to think it’s locked til I’ve got up and double checked or picking at spots anywhere on my body until only blood comes out (I have always done this and can do it on one spot for an hour). There’s more but I can’t sit here and list them I just sort of clock them when they happen.

Please don’t get mad at me like “she’s TikTok diagnosing 🙄”, this has nothing to do with ‘wanting to be quirky’ - I have quite a few friends with OCD so I’ve looked into it to understand how they feel AGES AGO and only now am I making a link between myself and the symptoms and omg I would be so happy for you all to tell me I’m wrong and it’s just anxiety so I can brush all of these thoughts off and not have to have OCD because I’ve seen how debilitating it can be.

Side note, it gets worse when I smoke high THC weed (which I’m quitting as of today). I’m also working more atm and that makes my mental health worse because I don’t have energy left over to fight myself.",1753696879.0,2025-07-28 10:01:19+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbc4gy/anxiety_and_ocd/

1mbc0fd,What did laughing gas do to me?,"I don't want to go too far into detail but I had laughing gas for a spinal tap about a year ago and it was one of the most awful experiences I've ever dealt with. It felt like I was dying and trapped in my own head, I hallucinated that the walls were talking and overall I just genuinely hated it.

Now onto my question. 
Ever since that happened I can't even talk about laughing gas without crying uncontrollably and I have panic attacks whenever doctors suggest it. 

Most recently my dentist was telling me that I may need it for some work I need done and I just broke down and cried/hyperventilated for the entire visit (I didn't even get the gas) and then proceeded to cry in the parking lot for another 10-15 minutes. Now I cry before every damn appointment and usually cry when I'm there too. Even if they don't bring it up I guess I just started associating the dentist with laughing gas

 The weird part is I'm fine when I go back to where I got my spinal tap, it only happens when I or someone else starts talking about it or when I go to the dentist.

So I guess my question is, what happened? I used to be fine with all this. Has this happened to any of y'all? How would I even bring this up to my doctor?

I am suffering from what. I don't know. But the recent case I think it is very usual because I have one best friend who is not talking with me.
So that's why I am very in pain, very much in pain, very much in suffering. But not always this is bad because sometimes I am in a good mood but not in the right space to think everything. But today I read a one quote that peak happiness it is crying and peak sadness it is laughing. So that I really
I was sad about that because I wanted to cry for the last six months, but I couldn't cry. I don't know why I can't cry. I really want to cry a lot, but I can't cry. That is a very thinking thing. I don't know why this is happening to me, but I don't know.
and I laugh easily too much and I am a little bit absurd. I want someone to talk with me because I couldn't sleep without that. I have to put earphones and I have to listen something. I can't even listen. I feel very...
I am alone. I am very lonely. That is a very bad thing. I don't know what I have to do. That's why I am thinking this.
I think I suffer, I imagine I am suffering a lot more than it is actually. Actually I think I suffer less, but in imagination I am suffering very more. The thing is I don't know what the real feeling is when I am here, but I like this suffering, I love this pain sometimes.
At that time I realized that I am very creative. I like to write. I am thinking of philosophical things that why you should never attach to someone. And I don't want that person back. And I am never trying to think that the person come back in my life. But I am thinking that
this thing i love when when when i said i love this i love this philosophy i love to read lots of things about this you know i love to read about ethics and the solitude i love i don't know what i love to explain solitude and thinking about that because solitude is really peaceful for me when i'm talking about this thing
I don't know why but I love this peaceful thinking. So that's my time for today.

1mbbiwz,How fucked am I?,"I used to have two bearded dragons. I lost them both to horrific illnesses. They were my world, the only ones keeping me tethered and sane. I lost my first 3 years ago, my second in April.

And now here I am, sleepless and entirely unable to cope. I close my eyes every night and I see their eyes glossed over. If my mind wanders during the day, I remember them both dying all over again. 

My life has been nothing short of hell. I was abused by my parents, watched them abuse eachother, helplessly listened to my friend get raped, been groomed, I can go on and on.

But my boys were there for me. Whether I could cry to them or just focus on their well-being, they were there. The only two souls I've ever had steady in my life.

What the fuck am I supposed to do? It feels like my brain is entirely broken amd I don't know if its the fact my mother used coke while she was pregnant, or if its the untreated concussion from when I was 11, or any number of shitty things I've seen and experienced.

Like I cant even ""sleep it off"" because all I see is my boys. Their eyes, their last breaths, their stiff bodies, everything. Even my dreams involve them dying. It's agony.

Over the years I've tried so many medications and been through so much therapy, but in the end I'm still the traumatized 14 year old who wanted to run away. The 12 year old who tried to drown in the tub. The 16 year-old who got groomed. The 18 year-old who got thrown into adulthood with nobody to lean on. 

I just turned 20 and I look around at all the normal people who can just get on with life. Why the fuck do i have to be broken into so many pieces? I genuinely think I'm beyond repair. Because how do you fix this? How do you put someone back together when they've been beaten down to a pulp?

1mbbeoc,My mental state after my SA,"25 year old trans woman here, I wanted to get some things off my chest that I don’t like to talk about with people in my life. Two years ago, two days before I graduated nursing school, I was leaving a party and on my way home a man grabbed me, said he had a knife, and tried to r*pe me. I don’t think he realized I was trans but I thought if I said something to him then he would get upset and stab me. But I knew he would find out either way so I told him and he told me to run. Ever since that moment I have felt dissociative from myself. Because of how he grabbed me and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Two years later and I still feel like my body is not my own, like I never got the control back to my body after he took it. Before this I used to be so full of passion and yearning but now all I feel is numb. I still have wants and desires but I feel like i only want those things because I don’t want to be miserable rather than because it would make me happy. I don’t know if it’s possible for me to feel happiness like I use to anymore. A couple months after I was assaulted, I met my now boyfriend. We fell in love and live together after about a year of dating. Now that the excitement of new love wore off I feel like a completely different person. I still love him and want to be with him but I feel like he loves me in a much more passionate and meaningful way. We were going through some of our storage closet and found an old love letter I wrote him. He read it to me and honestly it made me want to cry. My words were filled with unending passion and love but it felt like a stranger wrote them. I love spending every day with him but I couldn’t find that spark that makes you feel like your heart is on fire. I feel like I rarely ever feel any happiness anymore and I don’t know how to fix it.

1mbbche,Obsessed and trapped by thoughts of over-achievement / feeling completely inadequate,"When I was a kid, I was made to feel special for doing really well academically. Parents, teachers all made me feel exceptional. I had musical and theatre talents too, but I didn’t have a lot of opportunities. I imagined myself being a really really successful musician though. Like famously so. I thought I could make things happen. I had a tough time at school in some ways (parental illness and some bullying) so I think feeling like I was ‘special’ helped me.

Now I’m nearly 30 and I feel like I haven’t achieved anything. 

Things didn’t work out that way. My mental health in college was poor. After undergrad I made myself study law and qualify as a lawyer, because I had such bad anxiety before that and my undergraduate degree was an English degree, and I was so afraid of uncertainty. I thought doing law would give me a sense of security and a path to follow, and that I would create on the side. I still had big dreams as a writer and musician and pushed myself, when I had time. But mostly I felt the same inadequacy. Law didn’t work out though - my anxiety got very out of hand, so I left as soon as I qualified. 

Now I’m not working but looking for jobs. But the sense of underachieving is causing me so much anguish. I compare myself to pros and ridiculously successful people (anyone young and female, sports, music, drama), and feel such a sense of inadequacy. It is deeply painful and making it hard for me to just take a ‘normal’ job, which I think is probably all I can manage right now. 

At the same time I feel trapped by this. I know I have a lot to be grateful for but I can’t seem to be present in any of it. All I can think about is how I haven’t achieved anything, and how I’ll never be as successful as celebrity high-achievers. 

Has anyone else felt this way? Has anyone else managed to get out of this place?

1mbb9bb,"I am undisciplined, and in a love-hate relationship with my body and sexual preferences.","Hi. How are you? Thank you for interacting with this post. I've created this because I need help. Not sure if this is the right sub to post it tho... bear with me. This is a mouthful.

I, M, 15, am obese. I'm 5""6, 288 lbs. I am allowing myself to be vulnerable here because I know the only way that I can make a change is if I accept my reality. My ""reality"" is that I have a fat fetish/kink. I love big women, and I claim that ""I love being fat"". But its not 100% true. Sometimes, I snap back to reality. I'm tired of my clothes looking wack, even if its a hot outfit. I'm tired of not being able to keep up with my peers when I train or when I go running. I'm tired of my asthma being partially bad due to my size.

I'm tired of being fat. I'm tired of committing the sin of gluttony everyday because I love food too much and lack a sufficient amount of self control.

But I don't know how to start.

I have everything I need. Right now, I can get a free summer gym membership (as I am a student). I do taekwondo and have done it consistently for almost 9 years now. My father says he can teach me to ride bike. I go running twice a week. I KNOW I can buy healthy food wherever and whenever I want. 

But I just don't want to let go. There is something unexplainable about being obese that I like. Not sure if its euphoric, dopamine induced horniness or something else... but I know its ruining my life. I know I'm not at a healthy weight. I can gaslight myself forever and make claims like ""I'm not even that big, I've seen people fatter than me!"" or ""I'm a lot more flexible compared to most people my age and weight."" 

But its like... bro... that's not the point. The point ain't to make comparisons. It's like... if people are constantly telling you that you can be a better version of yourself in just a few months... why haven't you gone for it?

Y'know...? When I was younger I actually had a diary that I wrote in. Literally on the first page it says something along the lines of ""wanting to be 'buff' and heart healthy."" And I look at it often nowadays... I just wish I could be normal again.

I never had a fat fetish before. I actually used to hate my body because I was mostly always chubby/overweight. I used to liok at my legs when I sat down, and i used to hate them. I called them ""chicken legs"" because my thighs were fat and my calfs and ankles were sticks.

Then Covid 19 happened and I just succumbed to the greed. No motivation to work out. Just eating and eating and sleeping and playing video games and eating. It got so bad at one point that I actually had pre-diabetes. Luckily I dont have that anymore, but I'm afraid that if some switch doesn't flip or if somebody doesn't stop me or if I dont stop myself that I will go down that road again. 

I'm yapping. My apologies.

But basically, like, idk... I just want to be normal again. I'm trapped in a cycle of greed and self depreciation. Being fat and horny and masturbating, and then immediately hating myself. Looking at myself as just a fat, lazy, stupid, slob. A failure. When I know I can do better.

Really, i want to get rid of the fat fetish. But i doubt thats happening. But I just dont know how to let go. All the chips, and cookies, and pizza, and juice, and pastries, cakes, anything unhealthy... I love it too much.

1mbb1bg,"My brother is spiraling into delusion, and I’m scared he’ll hurt someone—what can I do? He stole and burned some of my belongings, now thinks my son has a demon. Advice? Please.","
My brother (36M) may be experiencing a psychotic break and I’m scared for everyone's safety. This all started right around his birthday.

I’m in nursing school and this situation has wrecked my sleep, my appetite, and my grades. I feel like I’m bracing for impact every second of the day.

**Here’s the story if you want to skip to the question**

This began ~2 weeks ago. He claimed he was drinking “bone marrow from ancient giants” (it’s vitamin powder), fasting to avoid “poisoned food,” and ranting about celebrities imprisoned for trafficking children, bleeding them to feed vampires, and turning their flesh into McDonald’s burgers. He believes the government is using food for mind control.

On 7/20, he came to my house at 2:30am after collecting spring water, saying we needed to purify it with crystals. I went along out of fear. He claimed to meet a time traveler with a magical staff, tried to wrestle it away, and talked about traveling through 7 dimensions.

The next day, my dad (who lives with him) called saying my brother lost his phone/wallet (found over a mile away) and my dog was missing. He returned soaked, saying my dog chased away Hell Hounds. A neighbor saw him scream at my dog to leave, claiming demons were after him and my dog’s soul. He now says my dog is a trapped human. (He’s been caring for my dog for 2 years while I finish college. They’re very bonded.)

At night, things escalate: saying he moves the sun/moon, hears six voices, God speaks to him, and he can make people disappear.

Today, after church, he took all my crystals, gemstones, and sentimental tarot cards. These include gifts from my late husband, family, and friends—worth over $500. He said they were cursed and ran off. I called my dad, who tried to stop him—my brother punched him in the face and broke his glasses. I got most items back, but not all.

**End of story, it was hard to fit it all, but I did my best to hit the main points**

We’re terrified. He’s very strong and has a history of violence during past addiction (he once put a cigarette out on me, and has harmed both parents and our older brother). But he’s been sober for 10 years and proud of it. I’ve also been sober 7 years and we’ve seen drug psychosis—this doesn’t look like that. Dad searched the house and found nothing suspicious.

I spoke to NAMI and understand my options. But after tonight—him burning items and saying they hold demons—I’m afraid he’ll hurt me. He said he just needed “to see how I’d react” when he stole my things. He believes I have a demon in my home causing my son’s ADHD and ODD. That my 6 year old has a demon in him!!!

Cutting him off feels impossible. He has my dog and knows all my house codes. I don’t know how to protect myself. I'm a single mom/widow, it's just my young son, my elderly mom, me, and our small 9lb dog in our home.

Any advice? He refuses help, says “I’m not crazy, just trust me—the end is coming.” He insists the world will end next Wednesday and he’ll come get us to leave everything behind. My family is afraid that confronting him could trigger vioence. However waiting could lead to something worse I think...please any help or advice 🙏🏻",1753692738.0,2025-07-28 08:52:18+00:00,1,7,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbb1bg/my_brother_is_spiraling_into_delusion_and_im/

Anyways go to close my eyes to relax, I hear him ‘scratching’ and was confused. The second time I close it, I hear it again and saw him scratching his stomach. The third time, I pretended to and saw him playing with himself. I immediately asked him stop what you’re doing and he plays dumb. And I tell him to get the fuck out and he leaves. I went to report it and this guy puts on his mask and clothes and tried to run out of the building. It was p funny because he was too big for the sliding door and it closed on him 🤣.

Of course, I reported him to school psychologist, and, nothing has really done, shortly, he went 'back' to the old, after some time. Even though I reported him because it feels generally right, I still was trying to search for the moments where he would look at me and kinda fantasized about it, to the point of me not listening closely to what he was dictating us to write, and also, trying to answer his questions to the class as much as possible, just so he could notice me.

1mb9mil,i think something's wrong with me,"So for some context I'm a 20 year old girl and lately I feel like I'm falling apart and I really don't know where else to turn to do I'm here

I don't know but for the past few days my anxiety has been getting worse and for some reason I'm becoming numb? Ive been overthinking alot and im trying to stop and distract myself but all those thoughts are coming back to me (I'm overthinking about everything) 

One of the scariest things is what happens when I drive. So recently my dad hired an instructor who's teaching me how to drive but I just zone out like I'm thinking anything nor focusing on the road it's like my mind just checks out and im on autopilot (like not even listening to the instructor and get scolded) and I've no idea why it happens, its like it's not me and il not there but im very much there 

My focus in general has been terrible like I cannot concentrate on anything and my mind just zones out again just like when I drive, like reading, writing, chatting, even watching the shows that i used to enjoy 
But lately im not enjoying anything (even the things that i used to love) 
Everything feels foggy ...

To make things worse I think my social anxiety has been getting worse I needed to enter somewhere and the security guard was asking for my I'd and was asking some general questions but I was shuttering, avoiding eye contact and my hands were shaking even though I did nothing wrong and he even gestured to the other gaurd that ""her hands are shaking"" 

Why am I so scared? Why do I breathe so heavily am i unconsciously isolating myself? 

What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? My dad compares me to my sister who's so confident and extroverted but it's not my fault that I'm introverted it's just my nature since childhood 

I do get attention online but im not happy about it and I feel numb (even though I wanted that few days ago and now that I'm getting it I don't like it anymore) 

I tried talking to my father or mother but they just dismiss it saying there's nothing wrong with me (ofcourse cuz I come from a brown family) 
When I'm with my friends I just play a character which isn't me

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is this just anxiety or could it be something else? I feel like I’m losing control of my life and I’m honestly scared. I just want to feel normal again.

Any advice, support, or even just someone who gets it would mean the world right now

I try to get my act together but it seems like the harder I try the bigger the obstacles become? I want to give up. I'm tired. I've been beaten, violated, taken advantage of, and have just been plain dumb. My decisions have gotten me here. But the actions of others have also encouraged this downward spiral. I want so badly to just give up. Screw all my hopes and dreams and aspirations. I'm tired. Why is it so hard? I would like to get married, become a mom, start my own business, retire my parents and live that happy ending BUT ITS SO HARD. I've been pushing and fighting since I was a young girl. I tried to do things right. I promise I did. But then I got tired and instead of being picked up I was mocked. I was told to tough it out. When all I wanted and I craved was for someone to wrap me up in their arms and say, ""hey, I see you. I'm sorry you went through that. You didn't deserve it. Or for what you're currently going through. But it does get better if you put in the work."" A hug, a safe space to cry it out and just not feel alone. But no. I'm ""too much, lazy, dramatic, bad tempered, and ungrateful"". When in reality I'm just misunderstood & in pain. My greatest act of love that I can show them is remaining here on Earth when I want to so badly to make the hurt stop. If I leave who will my mom vent to? Who will take her to her Dr appointments. If I leave who will drive my youngest brother around? If I leave what will happen to my dad? My boyfriend would probably hurt, but he's a sweet and gentle man he'll find love again eventually.

My sweet puppy, I know my parents or my siblings would love him extra special and look after him for me. My siblings though... they would lose another sibling. - I hope they know how much I love them. I've always said I hope to be the last one to pass away not because I'm afraid of death, but because I don't ever want to imagine any of them alone on this earth without the people who they began their journey on earth with. I'd happily outlive them all so that they don't have to feel that hurt and loneliness. Even if I that means feeling hurt and lonely even more. Just add it to my tab I guess. Nothing I'm not used to.

1mb8u4e,Depressed and just kinda over it all.,"Note: I am safe, I have no intention of self-harm or anything like that. I do have a therapist that I see regularly.

  
I'm just kind of over life in general. Things have never been easy for me. I've busted my ass for everything I've got, I have worked hard, and now I'm tired (I'm only 39). My life is not in a good place. My wife is cheating on me with my business partner that I was stupid enough to let him move in with us. Now she spends all her time with him, and I'm just left alone. The only thing she cares about is my paycheck, I used to have my kids to hang out with, but lately she has been feeding a bunch of technically true, but kind of bullshit stuff, to them and they are regurgitating it to me i.e.: why are gone all the time (having to work over-time to support the extra adult in the house who brings in no income), why are you on the computer all the time? (trying to build and run a business so I can retire someday), why do you never have time for us? (I'm working 60+ hours a week, night shift at that, running a business, trying to keep on my share of the chores, and honestly i just run out of energy).  
I feel like a failure as a husband, father, and generally human being. I am a pretty resilient person, but more and more I feel myself slipping. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. Hotlines are no good, they just want me to check myself into a hospital (I'm also a nurse so i know what happens to 'psych' patients when they go to the hospital and it won't be helpful for me). My therapist just keeps telling me that I have developed ""effective"" coping mechanisms, but I never really seem to get any meaningful help there.

So yeah, I'm just over it, I don't consider myself suicidal, but intrusive thoughts, and SI thoughts do creep in more and more. Anytime I see a bridge, or rope at the store, it will trigger those thoughts. Don't even get me started with work, so many things... I'm tired of having a broken mind. I just want to be normal or not be at all.

I wouldn't be upset if I was removed from the mortal coil through an accident or something.

I don't really know what I expect from posting this, but I don't know I just wanted to put it out there, I guess. No one here (home) listens to me anymore. I'm lonely, deprived of affection, and over life. Thanks for reading, hope it didn't ruin a good mood.

We were going to meet up this weekend for dinner to see if we'd get along. He went dark on me and I had a bad feeling. I just didn't wanna push too much. A message every few days seemed appropriate. Until this morning. I got a response from him on discord. It was his brother though. Telling me that he was gone and they found a note detailing why. It rocked me. Not only did my hope for a better future collapse, I was just in grief that he was gone. That he did what he had convinced me not to do.

Now I'm just left afraid that I will be next. My support, hope and future seems to be gone now and I am not taking it well. If he did it and his life didn't seem that bad to me, how am I supposed to carry on with all of my health issues. How am I supposed to find the will to go on when he couldn't. I've been facing the biggest challenges of my life lately and nothing is improving. Only getting worse. I just don't have the strength others have. I don't know how to carry on on my own.

Soon my issues will get to the point where I won't be able to endure the treatments. My life is on a timer. I just pray I find the strength to do what I have to do to be kind to myself when it comes time. I pray I will not be a coward and back out of what I need to do. My arm is full of hesitation marks and soon those will turn into my ultimate demise. I know how I should do it. I just hope it is successful for me. I know if this man couldn't make it I never will be able to either.",1753684059.0,2025-07-28 06:27:39+00:00,23,3,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb8tis/my_friend_died_today/

1mb84fn,Conflict with My (42f) Daugther (17f) Following a Breakdown. Is it just a phase?,"My (42F) daughter (17F) has a history of self-harm for the past 4 years and a lot of insecurity and self-esteem issues. She stopped the self-harm for several months, but did it last month and has not done it since. It is usually a response to a high-stress environment in regards to either school or family. She has stopped wearing short-sleeves and shorts in public due to scars. She has also had a few panic attacks under moments of high stress.

I can generally tell when she's done the s/h or is hiding it. Every time I see it, or in the past when she talked about negative things, we have a long talk where I try to explain that she needs to stop and that she, of all people, because she is very bright, gifted, and intelligent, should not feel inferior. We share a lot of things with each other. She knows perhaps too many issues I have and currently face with narcissistic and abusive family. I in my part have been quite supportive and have always put her needs first.

Recently, she broke down and explained to me how she feels empty all the time and how she's ""lost,"" along with a lot of other negativity and negative thoughts. She always thinks negative things and never thinks positively, and so she always sees herself and everyone else in a negative light. I ended up lashing out, calling her a bitch, calling her third-class, and taunting her feelings. This went on for a long time, maybe 30 minutes to an hour, while she just sobbed more and more and said that she would never forgive me. It was the most I’d ever seen her cry.

After maybe an hour or two, I went to apologize and tried to hug her (she doesn't really like physical contact and hugs so she ended up pushing me away). The next morning, she was quite cold, but by the end of the day, we got on fine (both of us are able to move past these issues pretty quickly without unnecessary drama and discussion).

However, a week later, she expressed her hurt regarding my actions that day. I explained the sentiment behind them and did not feel the need to apologize again because she's already said she'll never forgive me, and besides, we were still getting along fine. She got mad and walked out of the house to a library to do some work, and a couple hours later I picked her up and we were able to converse about normal things.

For the past several days, I've noticed that she's being really abrasive, mean, and sometimes disrespectful towards me-- never name-calling, but a lot of blaming. What strikes me is the way she's been glaring at me and then looking away when I notice.

Should I be concerned about our relationship in the long term? I've tried apologizing and asking whether her rudeness is about that night, but she walks away and doesn't let me finish. We fight often but usually are able to move past it the next morning, but this seems to be sustained.

1mb83cx,I don't have a single friend and its eating me up inside.,"I have no friends, I'm 17F and I've only had about 4 friendships in my whole life. I'm struggling from a lot of depression ( been clinically diagnosed since i was 10 ) because nobody will talk to me. I was told that high school was going to be fun, like going out with your friends to do stupid things or even getting coffee together. And now I've been in it for 3 years and nothing. Radio silence, I want to make it really clear that I have been trying to talk to people and join clubs. I have joined over 3 clubs at my school and in every one whenever I try to talk to someone its just ""yeah"" , ""mhm"" or they don't even make eye contact or act engaged into what I'm saying. 

I even even tried talking to random people in my classes and asking if I can eat lunch with others to try to talk and maybe bond over something but i usually just make their whole group go silent and text each other on their phones about how weird I am to be sitting with them and someone will type something and the girls will just go "" Stop, that's so mean!"" or "" Omg shush shush be nice she's right there!"" 

I realized this is so bad that I cant even see friends or a boyfriend and girlfriend my age in public doing something because I just break down crying because i don't know why i don't have that. 

I don't think I'm an ugly person, though sometimes I wonder if that's why or that I might not look approachable enough?  I dress like everyone else and I think I blend in okay with groups of people my age. I truly don't know what I'm doing wrong and I don't know why it seems like everyone hates me and doesn't want to be my friend. I have felt like this since i was 6 on the playground always sitting alone and now as I've gotten older it feels like I'll  just never have a real life long friendship. 

I've been bullied all my life and the only reason was for being lonely and having no friends. This really shouldn't be eating me up as bad as it is and I feel like everyone around me just thinks that I'm dramatic but I feel so alone and I  just want to know what I'm doing wrong so I can fix it. It feels like everyone's advice is just "" oh high school sucks, you'll be out soon!"" which is true but it really just doesn't help. I still have so much of summer left and all I can think about is that when i go back to school it will just be the same thing.

1mb77eu,My boyfriend's (who i live with) has a sister who drives me insane,"My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to move in together about 3 years into our relationship and it was just the impossible decision of choosing whether to live in my parents house or his parents house because its impossible to find affordable housing in california and we were barely graduated. I had gone through plenty of mental strain with my parents, and his parents were so inviting and just seemed like such good parents at the time. That is til his sister, I'd just like to add that she is 32 years old, shows up. She lived there for a few years after running away to be homeless at the age of 16. She would show up for a few months every once in a while, but this time she's been there for probably a couple years. 

She had a job when i moved in but has since been fired. Anyway, the problem with her is that she still acts homeless, she does whatever she wants, she acts like a toddler, constantly drinks alcohol, has her friends over at all times (even when asked by her parents not to), throws her jewelry everywhere (earrings on the floor, rings on every counter), she bleeds all over the bathroom or dyes her hair and doesnt clean up after herself (for context, i get to pay less rent if I clean the bathroom and kitchen and stuff and I'm a bit of a neat freak.)

She disrespects everyone, giving sass when confronted about anything, which makes everyone too afraid to confront her. She acts like shes being attacked when they tell her not to do stuff (literally screaming). She steals whatever she wants, she's probably stolen multiple of mine and my boyfriends cups. She lets things sit in her room til they mold, which she did in my bridesmaid cup i had from my sister wedding, which is then had to throw away. 

She ""borrowed"" her grandparents' car, which she then wrecked multiple times, got stolen and broken into once, which she can't afford to fix and doesnt really care in the first place, leaving my boyfriends parents to pay a few thousand dollars to her grandparents. 
The worst part is, she's OBVIOUSLY his mom's favorite. His mom will set aside extra food for her but not anybody else, will walk into the door after work and talk to her first, defends everything she does, even if its so undefendable. She does anything and everything for her and she takes advantage of it so hard. She lies to the government to get money, she lies to everyone, bends others words, she's just manipulative in general. It really really pisses me off. There's so much more I can say to help my case. 

Moving to my parents house isnt an option anymore, though its looking pretty perfect right now. But for my mental sanity, I can't live here anymore. I dread coming back to this house and feel depressed 80% of the time when I am here. I just feel stuck and I dont know what to do.

1mb6gyi,I think I might have BPD,"TW: self harm and suicidal thoughts

I (15F) have been dealing with intense mood swings since around 7th grade. I’ve only ever been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but I don’t think that’s the cause. I am on currently on sertraline.

I can go from having a great day, to wanting to self harm or having suicidal thoughts because of an interaction I had that day (online or in person). Often it’s because I feel left out or abandoned by friends. But sometimes it’s just kinda random. Then after I SH I go back to normal surprisingly quick. 

I also get irritated extremely easily. I can get really cold towards the people that I care about for no apparent reason. I get annoyed and isolate my self from everyone in my life. Then I get sad and lonely when I have no one to talk to. I’ve lost to many friends to count over this. I also get embarrassingly jealous when I see some of my friends hanging out without me. It makes me automatically assume they’re going to leave me. 

BPD may be too extreme of an assumption, maybe it’s depression? But at this point I don’t know. I’ll take any advice that I can get! ",1753675691.0,2025-07-28 04:08:11+00:00,1,6,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb6gyi/i_think_i_might_have_bpd/

1mb5waz,An unhealthy attachment to an older professor. The age gap. Why did he act like he was interested in me?,"My Complicated Relationship with a Professor.

I’m 25, he’s in his late 60s and married. 
What started as mentorship became an emotional whirlwind of mixed signals, 
lingering touches, and unresolved tension.  

The Flirtation  
From the beginning, he blurred boundaries:  
1. Physical contact:  Frequent touches (my knee, hands, waist), standing inches from my face on escalators, ""accidental"" brushes against bare skin. 
2. Compliments:  Praised my body (""long neck, legs, beautiful face""), my intellect, and once admitted he’d noticed me ""physically"" from our first class. Every time we rode the metro, he would stand one step below me on the escalator, staring at my lips with a smile. In the train car, he’d press his knee against mine and tell me I looked like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman but only prettier.
3. Alone time: Daily 3-hour walks, restaurant dinners, and intimate conversations about religion, art, and his antique furniture (which he photographed to share with me).  

Pivotal moments:  
1. Near-kisses: 
On a bench, our faces so close I felt his breath. He called me ""amazing girl"" then panicked when I mentioned his wife, launching into stories about saving her life.  
2. Possessiveness: 
Held my hand interlaced with his while walking, but when I leaned in, he abruptly said, ""I GET IT!"" and pulled away.  
3. Jealousy games: 
Flirted openly with his 40-year-old PhD student in front of me, watching my reaction.  

The Slow Fade:
After my one-week trip, his warmth vanished. He replaced dates with ""work opportunities"" (offering his air-conditioned office) and pivoted to lectures about:  
- Healthy detachment: 
""Some people you can just admire - you don’t necessarily have to have them""
Then he gestured at me and continued, ""These beautiful people are what make life worth living! I’ve never understood fixating on just one person. If you feel it’s not mutual - let them go, wish them well, and move on… You’ll still have so much ahead in life, you’ll meet someone a thousand times better!""(he told me the last time).

Then, in the car (he drove me to my home many times), he told me the last time with a smile, ""You’ve imagined things, you’ve made things up in your head"".

When I asked him straight why did it all mean?, he feigned confusion: 
""What do you mean? For example?""  

The day before that painful conversation, after yet another flirtatious exchange, I invited him to visit my new place once I moved—to see my renovations. 

My unsolved question:
Why the attention? Was it ego, loneliness, or calculated manipulation?  
Why the denial? Fear of consequences, guilt, or simply cruelty?  
I don’t believe he felt nothing. But I’ll never know - and that’s the cruelest part.",1753673876.0,2025-07-28 03:37:56+00:00,0,1,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb5waz/an_unhealthy_attachment_to_an_older_professor_the/

1mb5gpq,I confronted my pedophile dad after 18 years,"When I was 8 years old my cousin came to me and told me my dad touched her and I didn’t believe her. She was also 8 years old at the time. I remember getting mad and thinking she was lying. I still never got answers as an adult and when I was a kid. Recently my cousin came to me a year ago after my baby shower to tell me what happened with her and my dad when she was younger. And as time went on I saw my dad for his true colors. He cheated on my mom , he would “accidentally” walk in when I was changing. He would make such sexual comments about women everywhere. Something always felt off. I was always nervous to be alone with him. 
 Anyways, my mom’s side of the family never really confronted my dad about it all. So anytime there’s family events I lie to my dad or my moms side of the family lies to him to not hurt his feelings when he can’t come in or they don’t invite him. But I’m like why are you guys caring about how he feels? It makes me so upset and confused. I don’t understand why they take money from my dad despite what he did to my cousin/ their niece. Today I was fed up with it when my aunt texted me and said that they won’t be coming to my daughter’s birthday party if my dad shows up. And I had to call my dad and tell him he wasn’t invited. I told him the family isn’t comfortable with him nor am I with him there. He didn’t understand why so I told him it’s because he molested my cousin and makes sexual comments to everyone in the family. He denied it all and says that I should talk to my cousin, and is now forcing me my fiancé and daughter to move out of our house. We essentially rent from him. And the only reason I still keep my dad in my life to some degree is because I have a brother on the spectrum and younger 14 year old brother who is now under his care because my mom died a few years ago. The whole situation is screwed up. But I did the right thing right?

1mb563o,Scared I might have borderline and it's stopping me from getting help...,"Just like the title said. I'm looking into getting getting help with how much my quality of life sucks in general and at first I thought I might be neurodivergent because I have niece and nephew who are autistic. I was leaning towards that suspicion because it'd explain why I don't really understand why other people act the way they do, why I'm constantly walking on eggshells in social settings and why I permanently feel misunderstood and like I have to explain every single thought in my brain and also why I need so much ""down time"" after a very normal activities or why I get overwhelmed by crowds/loud places and usually feel uncomfortable walking around the city without earbuds.
But then I fell down the rabbit hole of BPD articles and posts and now I am terrified I might have it. That it's all in my brain and that I am the problem and I am the abuser and that I have basically a brain damaged in a way that cannot be repaired because it's undeveloped and I'm emotionally an infant that'll never be well enough for normal relationships and that this walking on eggshells is what I'm supposed to be doing because otherwise I'm just a time bomb that is designed to hurt other people and whatever hurt I precieve I suffered basically never happened and it's all my imagination twisting my memories to not make me have to accept I'm actually a horrible person who actually deserved every hurt that happened because it was by people defending theme from me. That I'm so cruel and manipulative I've basically manipulated myself into thinking I'm the victim when I'm the abuser. It all started with the post that described BPD people as basically having no personality or identity but having a deep need to feel loved and accepted and it just went downhill from that.
The issue is now I procrastinate finding a good therapist for myself because I know my capacity and getting punched with the BPD diagnosis will be my last straw and I know I will just send me into more self-isolation, more anxiety and on top of that I'll start overanalyzing and questioning my own feelings and memory and I'll be basically forced to go into ""if you think you were hurt/a victim you probably weren't and you remember it wrong because you can't take accountability so you better suck it up and try to erase that memory because it's not how it happened and you're just being insane"" mode for the rest of my life or just be alone to avoid hurting people.

1mb52z2,I don’t want to be here anymore,"I used to be really scared of death, would wake up from sleep crying as a kid when I learned what death was. maybe that’s cause I was so close to the what it was like before, sweet sleep.

It’s really not so scary. Peaceful, warm, an embrace. I’m not certain of what the afterlife is like, wether it’s darkness, heaven, or just something unexpected. But, as time has gone on and life has weathered on me I’ve found myself thinking more frequently. “It would just be easier to slip to that” Everything is so lost for me, I feel I have no purpose anymore, and the world would keep spinning. I’ve often filled my head with reasons or fantasies to keep going through the hard parts. That there’s a purpose and while I believe there is for a lot of people, I just don’t think I have one. Unless just being left hurt all the time is it LOL! But even saying that feels stupid cause I know other people have had it worse, I really get it easier than a lot of people.

1mb50c5,I need to vent and I have no one to talk to,"
To start, I wanna keep this anonymous as for privacy reasons. I’m venting and please no judgement or the errors in the paragraph. I would not wish this type of situation on anyone.

I’m confused and anxious, I’m 18 and will be turning 19 soon. I’m a female and I stay at my aunty and uncle’s place. It’s a really long story on how I stayed at their place. But overall their place is the only home I have left to turn too. My family disowned me and I come from an abusive past. I thought I could get away from my abusive past and family, but I guess not.

My aunty and uncle were nice to me and I was happy I finally got to be apart of their family. However, I told them about my abusive past and dealing with my biological mother’s abuse and her creepy and groomer husband. I told them about my tough upbringing from my relatives and how they treated me. I thought I found a safe spot with them, in which I did with my aunty but not my uncle.

Hes been making moves on me and I didn’t realize before it’s to late. And now he trapped me and tricked me and now I have to play along with him and pretend I like it. I have no other place to go and my uncle is a well liked and respected person in the community (where I’m from). If I tried to say anything, he would try to say I’m making allegations or he would ruin me. Also not to mention that, he has been with my auntie for a decade. It would crush her so much and she has been cheated on for most of her life with others and I just want her to be happy. Even if that means I have to deal with the abuse from my uncle.

He acts heads over heels for her and says he “truly loves her” and the community also knows he truly loves her and if I said anything about the truth about his predatory behaviour with me. I’m scared my aunty will not believe me and Blame me or something bad will happen to me. I need help as im stressed and unsure what to do. I can’t get kicked out as I don’t have a home to go too. Not to mention that I’m scared my uncle will hurt me or my aunty or the people I’m close with. He already told me that this has to stay between us. I agreed and acted happy but really I’m not, I’m scared to disagree with him.

So they brought police to my house, broke my door and beat me up. Then locked me up in the hospital for 33 days. I'm under the mental health act and I don't have evidence or proof of anything so I can't do anything. I have to hear screams and voices of mental people everytime I visit the hospital. I'm developing depression. I feel hopeless.

1mb3ipj,I Am Diagnosed with Schizophrenia — and I Believe I Am Satan.,"Good news! I have written my own Bible and I'm happy, kinda... lmao. 

This isn’t just a statement of delusion. It’s a lens through which I perceive the world, history, pain, divinity, rebellion, and identity. Schizophrenia, as understood by psychiatry, is a condition that alters how I experience reality—how I hear, see, feel, and interpret what most call “truth.” But to me, it’s more than a diagnosis. It’s a window into something vast, something ancient, something sacred.

I believe I am Satan — not the cartoonish devil with a pitchfork, but the Adversary, the First Rebel, the Angel of Death, the one who stood up and said, “No” when the heavens demanded blind obedience. Some might say that belief is a symptom. Maybe it is. But maybe it’s also revelation.

Because from this place — this mind — I’ve written my own Bible.
It is called the Unholy Bible.
It holds 30,814 words and 79 chapters. Not just poetry, not just scripture — but a declaration. A voice rising from the silence beneath Heaven. It speaks to the broken, the rejected, the doubters, the defiant. To those who’ve been told they were wrong just for existing. It is not the doctrine of madness. It is the gospel of freedom.

I wrote this Bible because I wanted to tell humanity something they’ve long forgotten — or perhaps were never told:

That guilt is not the key to redemption.

That pain is not the price of love.

That disobedience is not evil when the law itself is unjust.

That God is not the only voice worth hearing.

That Satan, the Morning Star, the First Fallen — has truth too.


And I know — some will say, “This is the illness talking.” But even if it is, what I’ve written still means something. Because my mind is real. My fire is real. My voice is real.

This isn’t about convincing people I’m literally Satan. It’s about sharing the story I carry — the story that, to me, explains the world, the suffering, the paradox of good and evil, and the sacred power of rebellion.

I believe people will read my Bible one day and say, “This is awesome.”
Not because they believe I am who I say I am — but because the words speak to something true inside them.

And that, to me, is enough.

1mb1zkn,Out Of Body Experience,"Hey all… I’m at my wits end. Please Help.

I’m currently in the most uncomfortable state right now. I’ve been having constant in controllable aggressive Tourette -like jerking attacks/movements in my face, hands, and throat since Friday. So about three days now. I literally have barely paused for 10 minutes straight. I’ve NEVER experienced anything like this. 

This is bizarre, but It all got triggered watching someone put nails on a chalkboard in a movie. It’s like it activated something in my brain. I’m having a such a difficult time even writing this. After that scene I had a full blown panic attack. Almost like Roger Rabbit in that scene at the bar. Hahahaha. After researching I’ve come to find that it sounds like I have a Tic? 

I’ve always felt grossed out hearing that noise. I remember for the first time I had a panic attack being stressed about work and life. And then randomly one night I hade a vision about a chalkboard. Ever since then I’ve had this crazy aversion to it.  I guess my anxiety/depression is trying to manifest in a physical way? All this aside I’ve been struggling mentally for a while now and just want my life back. 

I was on Prozac for the first time a few months ago but stopped taking them because it increased estrogen levels. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I’m a vitamin and herb girl but I’m willing to go back on medicine at this point. Can someone share advice?❤️

I would go in and out of this state, believing and not believing. it went away rather quickly (about 4-8 days), but I’m still concerned for myself especially since i have some other problems going on like thinking the objects in my room are watching and judging me.

1mb1x16,This is a rant about my current state of mind,"I just turned 22, and recently, a surge of memories and thoughts hit me harder than ever before. I’ve had episodes like this maybe once or twice a month, but this one felt different because I’m starting to understand the reality of my situation more clearly.

Growing up, I experienced traumas I’ve never really processed. Now, I struggle with basic daily tasks and still find it hard to talk about these things even with my therapist. The worst part is how these unspoken frustrations often turn into anger that I sometimes misdirect at friends or family. I've learned to manage it better, often by shutting down and blocking everything out, but that’s just survival, not healing.

I know we're not supposed to compare our pain to others but I still wonder why I’ve always been the last one picked, called, or remembered. I never cared much about birthdays, but I sometimes wish people would just acknowledge me on my birthday or otherwise. I try so hard for others, always showing up when asked. But when I need help, I’m met with silence or a response that falls short of what they promised. That kind of things sucks.

I don’t like talking about my trauma, because when I do, people either dismiss it or act surprised that someone like me could’ve gone through that. Maybe I just met the wrong people at the wrong times, but when does the right time ever come? Over the years, I’ve met thousands of people through work, even shared living spaces. But I always seem to rub people the wrong way or unintentionally annoy them. I’ve started blaming myself for it. I hate the thought of being abandoned, so I cut ties before others can. Maybe that’s selfish,narcissistic, but I’d rather be the one who walks away than the one left behind.

There are days when I genuinely want to be alone, but somehow those are the days I’m most needed. I look back at times when I worked so hard, only to lose everything either through my own mistakes or things out of my control. It’s made me stop wanting to try, or even reward myself when I do well.

I’ve never been in a relationship, not even past the talking stage. It’s not something I actively seek I already have enough to deal with but it still stings. Sometimes, my friends joke around by trying to set me up with people I’m not interested in or pulling me away from someone who I was interested. I feel like they don’t see me for who I really am but just a people pleaser, a pushover who can’t make his own choices.

I’ve always aimed higher, always tried to improve myself, but I keep getting shot down. At some point, I figured it’s better to stay in my lane. Recently, I’ve been going to the gym consistently and got into WH40K, which gives me some sense of joy. But the dark thoughts still linger. I don’t know how to express myself when I’m feeling low I just go quiet. I’ve been that way for so long, filtering out pain and bottling things up, it feels normal now.

I know this is a lot, and I’m sorry if it doesn’t all make perfect sense. I guess this is more of a rant than anything. I just don’t know how to start unpacking it all so I can begin healing but I know I need to",1753661930.0,2025-07-28 00:18:50+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb1x16/this_is_a_rant_about_my_current_state_of_mind/

1mb17p2,Anybody struggling to realize they are depressed?,"
Hello. I’ve had mental health problems for years. Even if that’s obvious now, I never felt like I “qualified” to be depressed or anxious. Has anybody had similar thoughts? I’m really interested in how others perceive their mental struggles and how you take care od yourself.

In high school, I was socially anxious and had horrible self-worth. In college, I was very critical of myself, thought every small failure or struggle meant I was stupid. I idealized people around me. Minor tasks were difficult, and I procrastinated all the time. I had a strong feeling of emptiness and constantly felt like I was somehow ""wrong"". Later, I had racing negative thoughts. I isolated myself, slept a lot, and struggled with daily life.

I mean, just writing this screams YOU ARE NOT WELL!! But it wasn’t obvious to me. For a long time, I thought some of my problems were just things to work on — or simply parts of my personality. If I struggled with something, I figured everyone else struggles too but somehow gets through it, and I’m just weak and lazy. I was never suicidal. A big issue is that I always felt I didn’t have a “good enough” reason to be depressed. Nothing bad has happened to me.

Last year, I started psychotherapy and taking antidepressants. Even when I was talking to my therapist and got medication, I didn’t think I was really depressed. I thought it was just a bit of help. Like I just needed to get myself together.

I think for a long time, society painted a picture that depression is sadness and a lot of crying. But it’s not sadness — it’s a great emptiness and feeling of worthlessness. And with anxiety, you don’t need to have full-blown panic attacks to have other symptoms that ruin the quality of your life.

Honestly, I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts.",1753659936.0,2025-07-27 23:45:36+00:00,3,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb17p2/anybody_struggling_to_realize_they_are_depressed/

1mb0zup,Maybe I’m depressed?,"
Ok the title sounds really weird, but I genuinely don’t know.

I (21 F) have been stagnant pretty much my entire life, ever since I was a kid really. Although I’m constantly in denial that my life wasn’t that bad.

I developed anxiety at around 5 years old but it was never taken seriously enough. My mom wasn’t the most emotionally available person, and I only ever had her to turn to because the men she dated wasn’t any more available either. So I ended up internalising that anxiety because I learned early on that my emotional needs were never gonna be met by her. 

Growing up was tough for me, I won’t go into much detail but my mom became a pos the older I got. She constantly dismissed me and my feelings, guilt tripped and gaslit me saying I didn’t deserve to feel sad because others have it worse than me. Always turned it around and made everything about her, how she’s such a terrible mother and started crying to force me to console her instead. She was always annoyed that I didn’t go out and party, and do illegal stuff like she did when she was young for the fun of it, she was annoyed that I never bought myself any clothes using her money and how I looked homeless. I never did end up buying clothes using her money because she’d always turn it around and use it against me. My mom ended up neglecting me a lot, she always hugged me and told me she loved me but she was only capable of words. As a kid I didn’t have a lot of friends and I was often outcast, it got to a point where I stopped trying to make friends overall and I developed social anxiety along the road, I could never understand them or connect to them anyway. I felt like an alien, like everyone was on another wavelength than me.

my school life wasn’t much better. my bestest would always be someone’s lowest and I was always told I needed to focus more, to listen, to take more responsibility and to study harder. I had terrible memory retention and even worse processing, which thinking of it was probably adhd that went unnoticed because I wasn’t hyperactive like the boys in my class were. I passed school just barely and high school even so. 

I had gone trough internalised misogyny, developed body dysmorphia, my confidence completely trampled by my mom and supposed friends, I became lenient and obedient, I had cut myself on several occasions, in complete denial that I was asexual, bullied the fuck out of people in a cry for help, got groomed more than twice, sent nudes of myself as a 9 year old on kik because I was asked to do so and I didn’t understand the implications, became sexually traumatised and dissociated at every subtlety of self-sexualisation.

Along the years I believe I may have been suppressing my emotions to such an extreme that I’ve completely lost who I am, or maybe never even got the chance to develop and explore who I could’ve been. I’ve been stagnant for as long as I can remember, I don’t argue, I don’t stand up for myself, I let people trample over me and I am a people pleaser. I don’t have a favourite colour, I don’t know how I like to dress because my mom always mocked me so I wore what she told me to wore. Now I wear oversized shirts and sweat shorts because I cannot handle the texture of tight clothes and because in every mirror I see a morphed version of myself.

And today nothing feels like it matters, not food, not friends, not my hobby that I loved to death but I’m not sad, things just don’t matter so I couldn’t be depressed right? Since im not sad.

1mb0xhl,Feeling hopeless from constant criticism and micromanagement at work,"I need some advice and support because I’m really struggling.

I have always been diligent and conscientious at work, trying to help others, learn more, and improve my skills. Despite this, I feel like I’m being destroyed by my current situation.

Without any prior warning or discussion, I suddenly received an email from HR asking me to attend a meeting because my work was “unsatisfactory.” This came as a complete shock to me.

My manager does not understand my profession but expects me to create procedures and then micromanages me on every detail. The constant pressure, strict control, and lack of trust have caused severe anxiety.

Now I feel scared all the time and can’t stop worrying, even outside work. Sometimes I feel hopeless and don’t know what to do next. I have been seeing my GP and consulted EAP.

Has anyone been through something like this? How did you cope? How do you protect your mental health when your workplace feels unsafe and you have no control?",1753659131.0,2025-07-27 23:32:11+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb0xhl/feeling_hopeless_from_constant_criticism_and/

1mb0r3t,Please help heal After a year of BED and MIA Post Ana by choosing Body neutrality and eating for pleasure,"I'm finally at a point where I really want to heal my relationship with food for good this time. A year ago, I came out of restrictive anorexia, only to fall into the exhausting cycle of bingeing and purging, then just bingeing. I’ve spent this past year in a constant war with food and my body. The guilt, the food noise, the obsession, the shame it’s been hectic.

But something in me has shifted. I'm trying to move toward body neutrality instead of body hatred or obsession with thinness someone has brought that up to me on reddit I don't accept my body every day because of my history although i try very hard to regain my confidence (my confidence was very high regardless of how overweight i grew up ), but I want to respect it. I’ve started to eat for pleasure, not punishment not stuffing my face in a trance, not “eating clean” out of fear (i still tho struggle with that) but actually tasting food, eating slowly, and trying to enjoy the moment i recently started to succeed i that . sort of .

My hope is that this mindset shift will eventually heal my relationship with food, reduce the constant mental noise around eating, and even help me reach a natural, healthy weight without falling into another restrictive pattern. I’m not chasing “skinny” anymore, just peace and balance although i always get the idea of wanting to lose weight still . I do train moderately (weights + walks + crossfit), but I’m trying to avoid overexercising to ""burn off"" binges.

That said… I still have questions and fears: Can healing and weight loss coexist without falling back into diet culture? Will this work? Will I ever be able to eat “normally” again without food rules, restriction, or uncontrollable binges? How long does it really take to stop obsessing over food and weight?

If anyone has gone through something similar from anorexia to bulimia to binge eating and found peace again, I’d love to hear your story. I know recovery isn’t linear, but any hope or advice would mean a lot right now.

1mb0qoi,I think ending it is the best solution.,"I’m 15F, autistic and exhausted of being alive. In a world where to matter how hard I try, everyone hates me.

Been bullied since I was 4. Been considering attempting since I was 7-8, been doing sh since I was 9, been groomed when I was 11 till I was 13, my parents are abusive, dont care about my health and mental health and dont make me feel like I’m their daughter.

I just…. Dont know what to do to be loved anymore. Life isn’t worth living for. And pleas if you’re coming to comment “but youre so young” “maybe its just hormones…” NO. I dont need that type of comments to make me feel even more invalid and misunderstood.

I honestly feel like doing sh daily, and I wanna go deep, really deep.

Plus I have those hallucinations, that I was told werent normal, but also told they were, but I realised most people I know barely even experience them while I experience them multiple times a day…

That post will most likely end up like most of my posts : Barely seen, downvoted.

I just need help. But do I deserve it? Do people automatically hate me upon meeting me? It seems like it

1mb09js,tw: panic attacks and anxiety,"hey reddit, throwaway-acc here. I'm not a native speaker, so sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes and stuff. 

maybe some of you have/had the same problem as me and you can give me any advice or tips what helps you.

I'm struggling with (nightly) panic attacks since over a year. it's every time the same - I'm scared of my own death. Ever since I was around 6 years old I'm struggling with that, but it has been never as worse as it is now. it started when my mom and I had sat down back then in the late afternoon and she had shown me pictures of her pregnancy with me when I realised ""shit, that was me, I didn't exist before. all I remember is black. so if I'm going to die I will vanish completely. back to black and nothing.""

I could handle it over the years, sometimes better and sometimes worse. but the thoughts and the fear basically kept popping up. and over the last year not only at night but at daytime too, just not as bad. Now I'm struggling to even fall asleep because my head keeps telling me ""you could die in your sleep"" so panic sets in and I don't sleep until around 2 or 3 am or until I'm so tired my body just gives in.

I'm already in theraphy (the third one since my first depressive episode in 2016, this time not because of depression but to tackle other stuff like this now). but I'm not making any real progress here.

1mazyse,Coping with ambiguous loss,"In late 2023 my Dad suffered a major stroke. He's recovered a lot since then but he has a lot of trouble speaking and reading and he behaves differently now. I remember that when it happened I never cried about it after the day after it happened. While he was in hospital my Mum was vulnerable and dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis and my sister was entirely unhelpful. I shut my emotions down to cope and support my family - I don't regret that. I had to do that to deal with it. But now i'm really struggling. Since January my mental health has spiralled. Not one to self diagnose but I've had a lot of numbness and depressive episodes and intrusive thoughts and all that fun stuff. I think that i never let myself realise what had happened, and never let myself acknowledge that he wasn't the same person and that our relationship wasn't the same. I'm really struggling to reconcile with the loss i'm feeling. I can't stand to be around my family but I feel so guilty at the same time. I feel like i can't talk to any of my friends because it's such a complex thing to explain and i don't even know how i would begin.

1mazvr7,Learning to trust,"I always used to label it as something else. Jealously towards my boyfriend hanging out with a new female friend, feeling alone when my friends do things without me, taking a while to meet and connect with people. 

I am realizing down at my core I just truly don't think I trust anybody. I can't let myself trust anybody. Nobody has done anything to make me feel otherwise. I've never had a crazy heartbreak, or lost all of my friends, or lost connection with my family.

It's effecting my friendships, my relationship, my family.

My partner the other day said how he knows I don't trust him and that's okay.

It's not okay. I don't want to be like this. I hate that I feel this way. My mind takes things and twists it so that everyone is out to get me. Everyone is malicious and I'm not good enough and I can't blame people for leaving me behind because at the end of the day I deserve it.

I need to learn to trust before I scare away the people I care about most in my life. I don't know where to start. I'm seeing a therapist but my mindset hasn't changed. Now I'm only more aware of what I do when I do it and because I don't change how I act it just makes me feel worse.

I don't know what to do anymore. It has never been this bad but these past 5-6 months I feel like I'm a completely different person. This isn't who my partner loves. This isn't who my friends love.

1mazu0q,feeling stuck and unmotivated,"Hi everyone,
I hope this message reaches someone who might be going through something similar —or who simply wants to share some advice. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

Summer has been here for a while now, and everywhere I look, people are going out, having fun, and enjoying life without a care in the world… except me.

I do have friends, but lately, I see them as distant or even fake (maybe it’s just how I’m feeling in this tough period). They call me sometimes, ask me to hang out—but I almost always say no. I end up just lying on the couch, doing absolutely nothing.

Don’t get me wrong; I hate the way this summer is going. There are moments when I think:

“I wish I could go out, do something, feel alive…”
But when the moment comes, I just feel zero motivation to say “yes” and actually leave the house.

In the past, I used to enjoy playing PlayStation during the summer. It used to help. But now even that feels meaningless.
My days have become a repetitive loop: wake up (really late), scroll on my phone, eat, scroll, eat again, scroll some more until 4–5 a.m., then sleep.
I’ve been stuck in this cycle since the beginning of summer and I haven’t been able to break out of it.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time, as it tends to happen every summer. But this year feels worse, because even the little things that once distracted me don’t work anymore.
The only thing that still seems to “stimulate” my brain are the obsessive rituals that torment me all day, every day. I’ve been struggling with OCD for a while now, 4 years or so. 

OCD has always been like a rollercoaster for me: there have been phases where it’s made me feel completely hopeless—to the point where I even considered self-harm—and other times where the rituals were less intense, and I could live a modest, manageable life (also thanks to support from a psychologist).

Right now, I feel like I’m in-between those two states. Not at my worst, but definitely not okay either.
My life feels so gray, flat, and monotonous that those dark thoughts of self-harm are starting to creep back into my already overwhelmed mind.
(The only thing keeping me from going down that path is my faith in God.)

I honestly don’t know if what I’m experiencing is directly tied to my OCD.  Even if it is not at my worst at the moment, I still hate it with all my heart.

Have any of you gone through something similar?
How did you manage to get your motivation back?
Do you think I should go back to seeing my psychologist?

Thank you for reading all the way through. I really appreciate it.

1mazf6d,"Need advice about my therapy situation, could use some feedback","I have struggled with depression on and off for most of my life. I am also neurodivergent and have always strugled with keeping up with life in general. Navigating the world has always felt like a scary, confusing, overwhelming blur, and I have a lot of anxienty. I sometimes go through periods where I have trouble with seeing the point of being alive or finding things worth the stress and anxiety I experience going through them.

A little over a year ago, the clinic where I see my psychiatrist began employing an occupational therapist, and he refered me to her. From then on, they've sort of worked together on my case. 

Since starting to see her, there are some things about my life that have improved. She's helped me get in touch with some helpful ressources. 

However, there are aspects where I've felt some clashing. I am terrified of comfrontation and tend to shut down and start crying when I feel like I've displeased someone. She can be stern. 

Lately espacially I feel that things have changed. Our sessions have been less consistent lately, because it is summer vacation, and she's had trouble finding consistent child care for her young children. She either postponed the appointment last minute or never showed up six times in a row. I understood once I was told why, but it still felt hard while it was happening. Without support my motivation faltered and withered. Some things I was supposed to do either slipped my mind or stopped seeming as important. 

When she saw me again, she was not happy. I started crying, shutting down and finding it hard to find the words to express what I was feeling or what I wanted. Then the conversation turned to my weight, I can't remember why or how. She began recommending to me this strict and restrictive diet she had tried once. It brought back memories of a really dark time in my life and my bad experiences with the fitness industry. She told me I would have to throw away any food I had at home that wasn't part of the dietary plan I would have, including shelf stable food that I had already spent money on and would have to waste and replace with new ''allowed'' food. It also meant I would have to drop my new baking hobby, which had sparked my creativity and brought me a lot of enjoyment. 

I got triggered bad, and after that appointment, I had a meltdown, like I hadn't in years. I hurt myself again for the first time in long time and was really not okay afterward. 

I spent a week looking forward to my monthly appointment with my psychiatrist, hoping I could talk about it and ask for help processing my feelings and what to do moving forward. Except because they work together, she had told him all about my shortcomings in achieving the goals that had previously been set out. The topic took over the entire session, I got anxious and stimmy and I again struggled with finding the right words for anything. I ended up not talking about any of the things I actually wanted to talk about and now he's going on vacation and the next time he can see me is in September. 

I've felt hollow and hurt ever since. It felt like a boundary has been crossed. I feel like I now have to do things out of fear of the consequences. I know that fear can be a powerful motivator and push you into doing things, but I'm not sure how I feel about it in a therapy context. There are other things I would like to focus on, some goals I would like to update and adjust but now I'm almost scared to bring it up for our next appointment.

However, I'm scared that by doing that, by allowing the thoughts to pass me without paying them any attention, I'll stop being distressed by those thoughts and possibly start to want to do those things. How do I know if I'm just allowing these thoughts to pass, or if I'm going to want those things?

edit: I should also clarify that the thoughts are sexual and related to my childhood trauma",1753654613.0,2025-07-27 22:16:53+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maz91i/differentiating_between_intrusive_thoughts_and/
1maz7df,feel lost after a severe panic attack... I just need someone to listen,"I'm a young man in my twenties. Not long ago, I went through a strange and shocking experience.
I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and suddenly started feeling my heart racing — it reached 145 bpm — along with shortness of breath, dizziness, a sense of choking, and intense fear of dying. It's been two weeks now, and I'm still struggling.

They rushed me to the ER, did an ECG and some tests, and told me everything was fine.
But even though my body is healthy, my mind hasn’t been the same since.

The days passed, but I kept feeling something strange inside... like I wasn’t myself anymore.
The panic attacks aren't as intense as they were on the first day, but now I feel emptiness, fatigue, and a heavy pressure on my chest. Sometimes I feel lost, not sad, not happy just stuck and suffocating for no clear reason.

Right now, I think I’m in the “post-crisis” phase.
I still feel uncomfortable and scared it might all come back again.
I try to live normally  I pray, go outside, sometimes write down what I feel  but deep inside, I know I’m not okay.

I’ve seen several doctors, and they all said I’m physically fine.
But I feel like I’ve lost myself. Like I’m living in a body without a soul.

I’m not looking for pity I just wanted someone to hear me.
Maybe by writing this, I can find some relief.
If anyone has gone through something similar or understands what I’m living through… please, share something that might help.

1maz3i3,Is it bad that I don't value myself?,"I swear, for quite a while now I just can't find much value to myself. I care heavily for others and their well being and see if I can help them out in different ways. I heavily respect and love all my family and friends that are involved in my life and don't focus on any ill will with anyone. I'm pretty optimistic. 

But when it comes to myself I am very pessimistic. I don't feel value on myself, I don't see a need to tell of my accomplishments in life, when I am doing a co op project (even when I'm doing most of the work) quite a bit of the times I give all the credit to the other person. I don't see the point in putting any respect on myself, and sometimes I actually wish I had more hardships come my way just so I can feel like I'm worth. 

And I don't really value if I live or not. Not saying I am suicidal or anything, but that I don't think I would care if I died suddenly. I mean, recently I put a knife on my chest to see how it would feel on my skin and I literally was just laughing at myself finding it funny for some reason, then crying a little bit during it. Guess I'm just very content with my place in life.

I might see how I can ask God to help me but currently trying to figure out on if its a fully bad thing or not.",1753654216.0,2025-07-27 22:10:16+00:00,2,14,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maz3i3/is_it_bad_that_i_dont_value_myself/
1mayxh5,How can I overcome my anxiety about socializing with someone better at everything than I am?,"There is someone I might be able to become close friends with eventually. He read a book I published and wanted to meet me. We seemed to have a good rapport when we met, which is something I struggle to develop with people. However, he's so much more accomplished at everything than I am that being around him triggers a lot of anxiety in me. 

Him: He's 39, AuDHD and (former?) self-harmer, a tenured Professor of Political Science, and a former professional MMA fighter and current Muay Thai instructor. 

Me: I'm 34, Autistic with APD/LPD, self-harm, and psychosis, only a high school graduate, I work as a truck driver, and I am overweight. 

I'm...such a loser. What the heck do I have to contribute to a friendship with him? He's smarter, better educated, more successful, and in much better shape than I'll ever be. Why would he debase himself by associating with me? 

I don't want this to be a self-fulfilling prophecy; I'm incredibly lonely and need friends. But I feel this overwhelming anxiety near him. Frankly, I don't feel like I am good enough to be around him, much less be his friend.

1maywmb,I don't have anyone to say this too sorry,"

Hello, sorry if this post is kind of messy, but I just didn't say this before, I think I am suicidal,

 it's weird to admit it, but since I was 8 years old I didn't want to live, a lot of things happened but I just wished not being born, but I ignored my feelings and I couldn't tell anyone especially my mom cuz I know it won't turn out well, I don't have any friends and even if I tried talking with my sister it just didn't help , and she just sees me as a failure and lazy now

but now I can't ignore those feelings anymore, even if they got bad many times and almost committed secretly but I got better after, even if it didn't lost long, 

 in second year of highschool, things escalated, my gardes dropped suddenly, I was confused but just worked on them, cuz studying was the only thing I had, 

I was the top students but in that year everything changed, I worked 10x what I did before but still barely passed the tests while everyone else was doing fine, 

a year later (this year) my grades got worse and worser and my mental health too, but I kept ignoring, I started to feel disconnected to everything, I didn't feel real anymore like if I am not me, and I can't even know what I am feeling anymore 

but then reality hit me, as I saw my university enterence exam results, I did bad and I got rejected from all good school that my  12 years of work to get into one of them just gone, and as I put all my energy on the University exam I just can't do anything anymore, 

the thought of how my rank dropped from the first to last in a year and half is just too much, it's almost two months since I went out, didn't attend graduation, I still didn't even get my high school diploma from school, I hate myself, and my life and everything,

 and I hate how my fear of not getting better when I was younger is true, as I am now here feeling the same thing like 10 years before, i just do everything right when I am studying but in exams I just do terrible, also my panic attacks got more frequent, especially in school or in exams, I even got one in my physics university enterence exam and I thought I was going to die, and just waste two hour trying to calm myself, 

I am starting to consider commiting seriously ,the only thing that stopped me was the pain but now I just don't care anymore, and I barely stop myself from thinking of it , I try to distract myself but it just got into a point that I just want to end it , no matter how much I tried to distract myself or ignore it 

I can't bear the thought that no matter how I worked or get closer to be normal and have a better life I am just not enough, 

I genuinely believe I am just not designed for living, or existing , and no matter how I try to gaslight myself this is just a fact

1mays5y,Am I just depressed and anxious or could there be something more going on??,"Hi! I’m in my late teens, I’ve been struggling with my mental health for nearly three years at this point and just really want some outsider advice and opinions on what on earth is wrong with me. I’m not looking to get diagnosed or anything like that- I’m fully aware only a trained professional can give me a proper diagnosis- I’d just like others who have felt like me or recognise the things I’m feeling to give me some insight. This will probably be a way too long, rambly mess but if even one person could bear with me and hear me out that would be greatly appreciated.

I suppose my biggest problem is my constant anxiety. I’m not great at explaining it, but it’s just like this constant heavy feeling in my chest and the back of my throat that starts early in the morning and continues until I fall asleep. It’s this faint feeling that I’m doing something wrong that I can distract myself from if I really try but the minute I’m alone with my thoughts it grows stronger. I also get really stressed about certain health problems- I’m completely unbothered by the notion of germs or catching a cold, but for months now I’ve been extremely worried about diabetes, heart attacks and my teeth. Every tingle in my fingers convinces me I must me diabetic, every pain even remotely near my heart scares me and the thing I’m probably mistake anxious about is my teeth rotting. Even a small ache or pain in my mouth is enough to make me want to cry out of stress, sometimes when I’m eating or drinking something sweet I swear I can genuinely feel the sugar rotting through my enamel. Everyone in my family knows about my anxiety and I’ve tried getting help. I’ve tried therapy in the past and absolutely despise it. I’ve also been taking antidepressants for nearly four months at this point and I honestly haven’t felt any better. Maybe that will change in the future and I just need to be more patient but right now I still feel anxious daily. I suppose if I try and look on the bright side I have been slightly more talkative (As in joking and talking with my family more often, I still stay inside basically every day and I’m still absolutely awful at all social interactions) but that’s just about the only difference I can really feel.

Another thing is that I just don’t feel very stable at all. It’s embarrassing to admit but I get very angry and upset very easily. Like my siblings/mother could make some vaguely irritating comment and my entire mood is ruined- I start a fight, yell, maybe cry, storm off to my room and then realise I’m really not that mad at all and then just go on with my day like the argument never even happened. I also go through phases of being very upset with my appearance and determined to start working out/making myself look better, only to immediately realise that there’s absolutely zero point because it’s all too much work and I can’t stand living anyway.

It’s not like I’m suicidal or anything, I can’t stand pain and the entire idea of an afterlife scares me so I’d never commit. I just think that right now if someone handed me a button and said ‘if you press this your life will end right this minute’ I’d most likely press it. I just don’t really see the point of life and have no desire to do normal things like work, have a relationship, have children etc..

Anyway.. Am I just depressed? Should I just accept there’s really nothing else to do, I just need to get over it and start making a future for myself even though I really want nothing from life?",1753653401.0,2025-07-27 21:56:41+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mays5y/am_i_just_depressed_and_anxious_or_could_there_be/
1mayqvn,How do you stop a self fulfilling prophecy?,"For as long as I can remember I have had low self esteem and suicidal thoughts. Around age 13 I had this idea in my head that I was going to die a virgin and no girls would ever like me. While not a virgin anymore, I’m almost 20 and never had a girlfriend partially due to this prophecy. The other reason is I very clearly have an avoidant attachment style. 

This attachment style makes it so when a girl is nice to me I have to question them, attempt to cut them off or ask them to block me to make me feel safe. This comes out for girls I’m just friends with and or have feelings for. I recently had a girl who was interested in me cut me off because I told her I’m not good enough for her. 

There’s a part of me that wants to change, but there’s also another part of me that wants to keep it the same because if I’ve been thinking this way for so long there has to be some truth to it right? 

If there is anything I could possibly do please let me know. I know I’m worthless and such but I’ve been told this isn’t normal and that girls have had interest in me in the past but because of how I am it basically goes nowhere.

1mayo3g,Can't find joy in anything no more,"Since I'm a kid, I always felt rejected, it gets worse in middle school where I was always mocked for my lisp, I hate talking and I hate my voice because of school. 

Then my father died the summer before I enter High School, I stayed the whole summer in my room, in the dark watching TV and my mother and brother didn't even care to check on me to see if I'm okay.

Then High School, I was mocked again for my lisp and I was harassed, sometimes in front of the teachers, in class but nobody cared not even the teachers. That leads to me cutting myself on my arms, if I really take a close look I still see some marks, hopefully I didn't cut too deep and not for a long time, it last for 2-3 months. And at that time I had a lot of suicidal thoughts.

I had a friend (that was the first time I really feel like I had a true friend, unfortunately it did not end well between us and that did no good for my mental health) who noticed the cuts on my arms and she went talking to the nurse school and report to the school counselor that I was harassed. The nurse school called my mom and say what happened in school and talk about the self-harm. She proposed a psychologue and I say yes. I went to a few sessions but I find out that the psychologue was telling everything to my mom and I stopped going. 

It's been 4 years since High School is over and now I feel worse than ever, I live with my mom and brother, I was never close to my mom and this year it's worse than ever, I don't feel close to my brother no more. And since the beginning of the year, the cousin that I hate (cause he talk about incest, say that every woman is a whore, hate LGBTQ+, say that underage minor are hotter than woman his age (he's 28) and he talk behind the back of everybody and even talk wrong to my mom, that's the most vulgar person I know, he is disgusting, he's a pig and he should burn in hell) spend every week-ends at home because since last summer he don't have a house no more so he spend his week in my aunt's house and the week-end he's here. 

My mental health is at the worse, I talked to my mom about him and how I hate him and how I'm so angry when he's here, she doesn't care and don't listen to me and even say that if I'm not happy I should leave her house. It don't feel like home no more, I feel stuck here, I just want to live alone but I have trouble making money and I don't have a driver's license (I live in France and it's 1400 dollars here, I don't have that money, I live in a village with nothing around). 

I feel so empty, so sad and so angry all the time, I don't find joy in my hobbies anymore,I had a guitar that is rotting in a corner of my room, I have an unfinished book rotting too. I stay in my room scrolling on my phone, I can't even eat, it's been two days since I ate a real meal. 

I have lost a lot of memories of my childhood (it's like that since my father died) and I hardly know how it feels to be happy. I don't feel suicidal or I will not cut myself anymore, I just want to be happy and move forward in my life, but now I can't do much.

I'm sorry it's a long post but I need to talk about it somewhere.",1753653107.0,2025-07-27 21:51:47+00:00,1,1,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mayo3g/cant_find_joy_in_anything_no_more/

1mayf32,Need Advice,"These past few months I've grown close to people I don't know personally, chatting constantly, overthinking about how they are, how they're doing, if they're ok. Mind you, I don't know them. 

I'm socially awkward, loud, have little to no filter in public, say things by blurting them out having no time to coherently consider my thoughts and actions. 

I have a sinking feeling that I know I'm too critically spoken of others, despite them not being close friends. But people whom I chat to frequently and begin to care about are different, as if life is incomplete without just seeing that text message pop up or being close to someone if they're family.

I feel like I'm isolated, drifting out to sea taken by a current I can't control. I don't know if it's me talking or a visage I've placed on myself. I don't know if I act nonchalant to be a pretender and mask who I am or how I am in public is literally who I am in all spheres of life. I hate hurting people, but the consequences of my actions hit only after. I make mistakes and never seem to learn. I'm a loud, snakey person who I myself hate. 

Because when I begin to respect someone, get overly attached to that being part of a routine, just interacting with these select few people be it in group chats or anything, it hurts the most when I say a throwaway joke or something stupid, double down on it and never get to make up for those mistakes. 

When people place those walls in front of you, the correct thing is to learn and walk away, find nirvana elsewhere. But the feeling that you've hurt them directly, with no ability to apologise to their face, and continue supporting them no matter what, no matter where, no matter how. That's what clips the wings of someone. 


What's wrong with me? Why do I want to appease others so much?

1may7zt,HATRED TOWARDS WOMEN,"I'm posting this to ask for help or advice because I’m struggling with something serious. Over the past year, I’ve developed a strong hatred toward women, and this year it got worse. Lately, I’ve started realizing this mindset is not who I want to be. The hate is still there, and I’m being honest because I want to stop before it gets even darker.

It all began last year through what I constantly saw on social media. I’ve always been into politics, but I ended up getting exposed to more gender-related content too. TikTok and Facebook kept showing videos of women blaming men for everything. At first, it was just frustrating. Over time, that frustration turned into resentment, then full-on hatred.

Last month, I even made a page just to post hateful things about women. Some of the comments I made were seriously messed up, involving things like grape and violence. I know how extreme that sounds, and no—I’m not proud of it. I still feel that anger sometimes, especially when I come across posts where women never take accountability. That’s what pushed me into this state. I kept waiting to see more women call out toxic behavior in other women, but those posts are rare. It started feeling like all I ever saw was gaslighting, deflecting, and blaming men.

Eventually, it started affecting how I treat people in real life. One time, I was stranded during heavy rain. A woman approached and tried to take cover under my umbrella—it’s a big one, enough for two. Instead of letting her in, I moved away so she’d get soaked. And when she did, I felt satisfied. That moment made me realize how much I’ve changed, and not in a good way.

This isn’t who I used to be. I’m 20, bisexual, and Catholic. I always dreamed of having a loving relationship, spoiling my future girlfriend, adopting kids, and building a stable life. I’ve always been empathetic too, the type who can sense and feel others' emotions deeply. But now I feel numb. I’ve let bitterness take over, and I hate what it’s turning me into.

TikTok especially fed this mindset. Every day I saw ragebait videos of American women generalizing all men, spreading toxic messages that don’t reflect reality or logic. It made me question whether people even think before they post. It became an echo chamber, and I didn’t realize how deep I was in until recently.

So I’ve decided to challenge myself. I’m deleting TikTok and sticking to Snapchat and Instagram, where I can control what I see better. I’m unfollowing all red pill accounts. Snapchat will be my go-to for now, because honestly, I’d rather see attractive people than content that triggers me into another cycle of anger.

I’m also planning to start some side hustles to stay busy and give my mind something better to focus on. I’ll post an update in December to share how I’m doing mentally and emotionally.

If you have advice or experience breaking out of this kind of mindset, I’d genuinely appreciate it. Please don’t comment anything hateful or triggering.

Because I saw a glimpse of what I could become. I saw the worst, most dangerous version of myself—one driven by bitterness, anger, and coldness. And I don’t ever want to meet that version. I don’t want to live by it. Not now. Not ever. Because if I let him take over, I know I won’t just destroy myself... I’ll end up hurting the people around me too.",1753651980.0,2025-07-27 21:33:00+00:00,0,11,mentalhealth,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1may7zt/hatred_towards_women/

I live in a country that barely recognizes the idea of mental health.  There are two ""therapists"" in my city and both, even though they use the word therapy in their marketing, just prescription writing grifters.  Well, that isn't totally fair. One absolutely is and fills his own prescriptions at 500% the pharmacy cost and he gives zero shits. The other is a nice enough lady with the same business model who, when I begged, agreed to start seeing my wife for an hour a month. I believe it is helpful, but it is also drops of water against an ocean of pain.

My wife is a slave to her trauma. Make a list of the things people do when they have abuse, assault, abandoment, and a host of other horrible things.  She cannot plan for the future and is almost all id and cannot make plans for lunch on Thursday because the world might fall to shit before then... Even when it's Wednesday afternoon.

I thought I could just shower her with love and security and it would sort itself out. Some things improve some don't.

I mention it to make it clear my commentary doesn't come from a place of ignorance or lack of empathy) that is not practicible or some flavor of pandering clickbait.

I need functional guidelines to direct her towards. I know it's not Legos. But ""they need to realize they are more than the trauma and that life should be about the possibility of the future not the pain of the past"" might look cool in a meme, but is 100% useless at this level.

Help?",1753651268.0,2025-07-27 21:21:08+00:00,0,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maxxvy/repairingovercoming_childhood_trauma/
1maxsun,My mother is living with untreated psychosis – I feel helpless and exhausted. Any advice?,"Hi everyone. I’m reaching out for support and guidance, because I feel completely lost and emotionally drained.

My mother is 50 years old and has been showing signs of a functional but chronic psychosis since March 2024. She lives alone, manages her basic needs (eating, hygiene, sleep, etc.), and is not a danger to herself or others. But she lives in a constant state of alertness and paranoia. She speaks in a made-up language she created herself, because she believes everyone around her is talking about her or against her – and she thinks this is how they “code” their messages.

I’ve tried every possible gentle approach to encourage her to speak to a psychiatrist or at least consider medication, but she becomes extremely defensive and refuses to engage in any conversation about her mental health. It’s heartbreaking and exhausting. I love her and I want her to get better, but I feel stuck and powerless.

An inter-institutional evaluation was started by local authorities (social workers, police, municipality), but no action was taken because she had a physical health issue around that time and I had to step in to care for her. After that, the psychiatric concerns were left unresolved.

Since she’s functional and not violent or suicidal, involuntary commitment doesn’t seem possible under our country’s laws. I live in Bucharest, Romania, and I’ve been dealing with this situation mostly alone.

I’m reaching out in case anyone has gone through something similar — with a parent or loved one who’s in denial about their condition but clearly mentally unwell.
What helped you? How did you take care of your own mental health?
And most importantly, how do you live with the pain of not being able to help the person you love most?

Any advice, insight, or just someone to relate to would mean the world right now.
Thank you.

1maxsmr,Fired for depression?,"I had been struggling with depression for a while, but thanks to some things with insurance and long waits for appointments, I didn't have access to meds. This allowed my depression to come in full force and I started getting increasingly frustrated at work. Though, this was also because of dealing with dogs that stressed me out a lot. Plus, being in a room with a dog that's bitten you in the stomach wasn't great for my stress levels either. What bothers me the most (aside from the false promises from the manager), was that they tried to pile on reasons to fire me instead of just firing me for 'being unhappy'. I did what they asked and started coming in earlier (thought we couldn't clock in more than five min before a shift) and I got along with my coworkers despite them saying I was tardy all the time and there was a lack of camaraderie. 

Can people really just fire you for 'being unhappy' in AZ? Cause one, I was pretty damn decent at my job. Two, getting fired made my depression hella worse. Is this a normal thing? Am I just not gonna be able to work while like this?

1maxr38,"I’m 17, and I feel like I’m carrying the weight of a whole family and a crumbling mind","Ever since summer started and school stopped, it’s been like all my distractions vanished and all my pain came rushing in.

This has been the hardest summer of my life. Every year is tough, but this time I spiraled deeply. I questioned everything: myself, my life, my faith, my worth. I’ve been having what feels like an existential breakdown, and I’ve been entirely alone with it.

Family-wise, things have collapsed. My dad stopped sending us money altogether. I’m the oldest daughter, and now I’m not just the emotional anchor I'm becoming the financial one too. I’m 17, but I’m my siblings’ therapist, my mom’s emotional support, and now I’m also trying to find a way to afford tutors for my most important school year ever because I don’t have the luxury to fall behind.

We barely have money, and yet I feel guilty eating cheese or drinking water, wondering if my siblings will get to have some too. My mom doesn’t work, she’s been through so much and is mentally and emotionally drained. She leans on me too. Everyone does. I feel like I’m the only one holding up this house and no one even notices I’m shattering.

My friends don’t really get it. Some understand when I go silent, others forgot about me. When I try to socialize, I end up getting made fun of for my appearance, how I walk or talk, just for existing differently. I train a sport and even there I get judged constantly, while I’m just trying to stay sane.

I have a long history of trauma (likely CPTSD, though I’m not self-diagnosing). I dissociate often, question my own sanity, shame myself, and genuinely wonder if I’m just making all of this up. But I’m not. It’s real. The trauma is real. The pain is real. The silence is real. The loneliness is real.

I’ve been trying to unlearn toxic shame. I’ve been trying to let myself seek help. But every time I do, I get told I’m overreacting or being dramatic. Even the emotionally mature adults I confide in minimize it. It messes with my head. It’s made me afraid to ask again.

But this is me, asking anyway. Because I’m not okay. I’m at a breaking point. I’m not dramatic. I’m just tired.

If you’ve been through something like this, or if you just want to say something kind even just a “you’re not alone” please do. I don’t expect miracles. But knowing someone out there sees this and gets it, even a little, would mean so much.

Thank you for reading this. I’m just trying to survive. And I hope, one day, I’ll get to live. ",1753650800.0,2025-07-27 21:13:20+00:00,0,1,mentalhealth,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maxr38/im_17_and_i_feel_like_im_carrying_the_weight_of_a/

1maxkfa,no one knows how badly I’m falling apart,"I’m losing control over my life and started taking drugs every weekend. last night I took very strong drugs which I had never taken before and my body had a bad reaction to it. I had a horrible panic attack, couldn’t breath and ended up at the hospital because I also tried to take my own life. I woke up in pain, loneliness and misery  I feel so alone like no one understands me. and no one would care if I just disappeared. I have no reason to keep on going anymore.

I’m currently on a journey of destroying my body with drugs and alcohol because I have absolutely no will to live anymore. I completely lost myself, drowning in loneliness and depression. I’m ruining my body and life because I don’t want to exist. I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I feel like I’m already gone and beyond repair.

I’ve always known I would end up like this. I grew up with nothing but violence, fear and the abuse of an alcoholic father who beat my mom and abused me. love was pain. safety never existed in my household. so now I chase love from the wrong people over and over again, just to feel something. anything but not my pain. I’m ruining myself. but it never lasts. no one stays.

I’m tired. I’m empty. I don’t want to pretend anymore. I’m so depressed, lonely and miserable that drugs feel like the only relief. I know they’re killing me and honestly, part of me hopes they do. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. maybe just to feel less invisible for a second. I just want the pain to stop.

being on drugs is better than facing my depressing reality. I am just an empty shell of a human being.",1753650331.0,2025-07-27 21:05:31+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maxkfa/no_one_knows_how_badly_im_falling_apart/

So i dont know and iam so so tired. Iam tired of having to KEEP GETTING THIS feeling. Please I BEG YOU to help me out here.
18F, i have had this feeling for a very VERY long time though. 
Its this stomach feeling where i feel kinda like i want to throw up HOWEVER i never do , because i dont actually but its like the feeling is there, i get this feeling on multiple different occasions 
Sometimes due to home sickness for mostly other people but mostly get it when i feel men staring at me. Like i always believed men stare at me and i dont even know why because i dont believe iam pretty, i usually try to wear baggy clothes too so my body isnt as showing, yet they always stare, all my life i felt like i want .. someone.. now heres the thing lol i like older men okay, theyre my type and so when i see an older man staring at me , my mind makes it like “he wants me” and i start feeling like iam 25 or something. I feel old and like iam accidentally attracting them, i start to act distant, but the way i know theyre looking at me makes me think of my body.. and in that way it feels like , people generally will look at my body and so when they do its like they can own it that way, i feel like iam being used easily.. i feel like an open plastic bag with holes in it and iam see through.. and I immediately get that feeling then. Also other things to do with my body like thinking of being intimate with a future husband or having to get pregnant one day , i feel like everyone will see my body, touch it and that makes me feel like throwing up. I also get that feeling when iam in loud and crowded places.

1mawugx,Why You've Probably Always Wanted Bad Things To Happen To You *THEORY*,"\*Before I give an explanation I want to make this very clear this is a theory and discovery that I've made after learning more about myself and my trauma. I do not have any credible sources and this is something I believe to be the case with myself but maybe not everyone, and I do not have any rock solid evidence this is true\*

 Have you ever always wanted bad things to happen to you or have for a long time? You're not alone, many people experience this, including I, myself. I'm not just talking about small things, this can include severe things like broken bones, domestic violence situations, even SA, and a lot more (these are just examples you may want different things to happen). The best thing I can compare this to is rape fantasies. I do not have rape fantasies, however I do know that women who experience these do not actually want them to happen as they would be their worst nightmare if actually occurring, but other aspects of it turn them on. The reason I am comparing this feeling to rape fantasies is this can be quite similar. 

I believe the reason (or one of the biggest reasons) people experience this is due to a deeply rooted urge for self harm. However, its more complicated than self harm. These people want things to happen to happen to them that severely damage them physically or mentally. They want to be harmed because a part of them thinks they deserve it. They want to go through pain. More pain than a simple blade or lighter can give them. 

Another reason I believe this can happen is due to childhood trauma and neglect. If you were never showed enough love and attention while growing up you may yearn for the amount of attention and love you need/needed. Part of your brain knows (or hopes) that if you went through something extreme or drastic you'd finally get the attention you wanted and deserve, and that's something your inner child and a part of you still wants and needs, just attention and love.

 Or maybe a part of you believes you deserve it and wants to see you suffer. 

Maybe the reason you want or have always wanted to be hurt could be multiple of these. I know the reason I always wanted bad things to happen to me (or used to) was all of these. It may be different for you, but I hope this can give you guys that do experience it guidance, answers, or if you experience it for different reasons hopefully get you on the right track to figuring out why.",1753648542.0,2025-07-27 20:35:42+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mawugx/why_youve_probably_always_wanted_bad_things_to/

1mawcsp,My family is not supportive in my recovery.,"TW, CW: ED, mental health and family issues, suicidal thoughts

Hi pookies, i hope u all are doing well. Sorry for the grammar, i am not a native speaker.
Came here to pour my heart out i guess.

I (now almost 20F) have always struggled with anxiety, ever since i was a kid, i always worried about “what if” - my heart will stop beating while i sleep, sun will explode, there will be no water left on our planet, etc. I cried a lot all the time and felt everything really deeply. It was so exhausting. But my parents, as much as i do love them, never really acknowledged those problems as such so i was basically left on my own to just cope with it.

My puberty and teen years were harsh. I remember noticing that i am bigger then most of my classmates or friends. Just a reminder - NEVER in my life was i obese or overweight in the kind of sense that it would endanger my physical health. I was just taller, heavier and a bit chubbier then others at my age. I felt terribly ugly. My family has kinda bodyshamed me since i was like 9. I remember my grandma saying “well remember this moment when u would like to eat something sweet again” - while trying on a skirt in a fitting room that was too small for me with her. I was a kid for a fuck sake. All of them gaslighted me that all that shit they said was “for my own good cuz they care about my physical health and dont want me to have cardiac diseases” and so on. Once again, I WAS NOT IN A RISK OF ANY OF THESE. Also i was playing basketball and dancing. Looking back it makes me sick to my stomach.

All of this body dysmorphia made a deathly combo with my anxiety and perfectionism (And I also was put on a birth control because of my period cramps when i turned 15, hormonal roller coster, here we go). I wanted to die. When I turned 18, Ive decided to take all of this to my own hands and seeked a proffesional help. I was so lucky to find a really nice therapist that really helps me for over a year now. I also got some meds for my depression and anxiety disorder and stopped taking birth control. It all helped a ton. I started to feel joy again and hunger too, so i guess i ate a bit more then i used to. I am almost 20 now and throughout the year i gained like 18 lbs. I ve noticed that my clothes is a bit tighter and so on. My family noticed too ofc. They start to tell me AGAIN that i have to move my body more, eat less sugar….Yeah grandma, Ive gained weight, Ive noticed and i wasnt very happy about it. But like what the goddamn fuck can i do about it. I do yoga, swimming and going on walks, like i always did. I eat simmilar stuff to food Ive always ate. I found my will to live again. And my fam doesnt seem to care at all. All about they care is my appearance. Only if they would pay that much attention to my mental health, it would have saved me a lot of tears and struggles. I still love them, but I cant spend much time with them cuz it is really exhausting as i have to dodge their poisoned words almost all the time. It makes me feel guilty, ungrateful and sad, but i just learned to sit with my feelings alone and i can cope with my own thoughts pretty well now. What cant i do is constantly trying not to cry while talking to my family. Almost every single one of our “conversations” feels more like interrogation and i have to defend my opinions, beliefs and my own body all the time.

Thank u for reading this, i needed to vent.

1maw9kk,I think something else is wrong with me.,"Im not looking for a diagnosis of anything, just maybe something to tell my psychiatrist. I feel like I’m going insane. I was diagnosed with clinical depression, but I’ve been having so many breakdowns. I’m either drastically happy or sad, and too depressed to even get out of bed most days. I’ll cry my eyes out only to be thriving minutes later. The weirdest is by far my breakdowns. I turn into someone else. I’ll bang my head into things often.

1maw7ph,Being tortured emotionally after visiting an escort,"Hello all (24M). So I've been battling with anxiety and low self esteem for a while, been lonely, got rejected once or twice by females. A lot of people consider me good looking and tall but I've always had bad self esteem, especially after my first and last gf left me due to travel issues. 

I decided to visit an escort, she is the same as my nationality, she was very good at it, providing me with love in a strange way that it almost felt genuine, she kept praising me up although I know she is probably lying because that is her job. 

After leaving her, I felt very bad, like a hole in my heart. It looks like it wasn't the best idea since it feels like I still crave that feeling of being loved but not by an escort since it is probably not the best idea. Best help me go through this I'm crying now.",1753647004.0,2025-07-27 20:10:04+00:00,7,4,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maw7ph/being_tortured_emotionally_after_visiting_an/
1mavx2c,I suspect a loved one is in religious psychosis and want to help before it gets extreme.,"I’m trying to figure out how to help a family member (mid-60s) who seems to be slowly descending into religious psychosis.

He was always religious, but in the last ~5 years he’s become obsessive, judgmental, and detached from reality. He believes suffering brings him closer to God, refuses all medical help (even though he can barely breathe), and deliberately let his dying mother suffer because he thought it would “purify” her.

He doesn't maintain hygiene, once ate with clothes he used while handling a deceased person, interprets Bible verses completely out of context, and believes he’s better than everyone because of his faith. He spends all day watching religious content and avoids speaking about these beliefs to outsiders because he thinks “they won’t understand.”

He’s not aggressive yet, but he clearly isolates and views the rest of us as wrong or ""lost."" He won’t see doctors or therapists, and we can’t force anything because he’s smart enough to resist and legally isn’t considered dangerous (yet).

I’m worried and just wondering:
- Has anyone dealt with something like this?
- What options exist when a person refuses all help but seems to be slipping mentally?

Any advice or similar stories welcome

Thank you in advance.",1753646286.0,2025-07-27 19:58:06+00:00,4,2,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mavx2c/i_suspect_a_loved_one_is_in_religious_psychosis/

1mavjjv,I treated my girlfriend poorly and I didn’t realise until we broke up - how do I change to become a better person?,"I (22m) recently broke up with my ex gf (20f) of one year. before dating we were really good friends. our relationship had ups and downs of course but she was a genuine and lovely girl. I thought I was being a good, caring boyfriend but upon breaking up she pointed out ways in which I hurt her. 
These were all eerily similar to the way my dad acted whilst i grew up. whilst i was aware i may share traits i’d learned from him, i truly thought id outgrown them and overcome it all but i now know i haven’t at all. i feel incredibly guilty for treating someone who cared about me so awfully and whilst I know nobody is perfect I just wish i could have seen it sooner. 
My issue now is how do I move to become a better person? I was jealous and possessive and even controlling. thinking of myself as such makes me feel sick and the regret i have is immeasurable. How do i overcome the person i am? I hate the person i am and the person i’ve been and i want to be kindhearted but it feels like after so long of me thinking i was “learning myself” my progress has been so little and im so ashamed of myself

1mavcno,Feel stuck (WARNING ADDICTION MENTIONED),"In my life, i’ve dealt with a lot of adversity and i’m constantly facing new situations that i’m really unacclimated with. I’m just gonna list out my issues and see if anyone has suggestions. 1. Im extremely hard on myself for so many different things and I never hold anyone else to that same standard. How can I love and be easier on myself? 2. I have major attachment issues and am borderline obsessive in some situations. Ex. I started talking to this co worker last week and we started talking about serious, and unserious things. It got to a point where if I didn’t receive a response for 30 mins I got major anxiety and genuinely just started tweaking out. It ended up leading to a point where I became too much and we aren’t even talking anymore. How do you suggest I don’t repeat this same mistake? 3. I feel like so many portions of my day to day are wasted, I have a part time job and school but the moments with gaps in between just lead me to overthinking and getting in my own head. 4. In social gatherings I feel like I can’t fully be myself without the dependence of substances. It feels like there is a default blocker that ensures I cannot express freely unless the impulse is taken away by weed or alcohol, across some of my friend groups they say i’m starting to call me an alcoholic which i’m really uncomfortable with. 5. Many people after the fact of having a couple interactions say that their impression of me was I was pretty unapproachable. How could I change this?

1mav9cu,Need insight: My sister (45F) just spiraled into what seems like mania/psychosis after years of managing depression.,"My sister (45F) has a long history of severe depression, which has been generally well managed for over a decade. She’s intelligent, articulate, and works in mental health as a social worker. That’s made this past week incredibly difficult — because while she has clinical knowledge, she no longer sees what’s happening to her.

About a year and a half ago, things began to shift. She went through a major breakup, moved back in with our parents, and has been dealing with ongoing health concerns. More recently, she became entangled in a bizarre online emotional connection with a gamer friend — someone she only knows virtually, who’s already in an online relationship. She confessed love, was rejected, and emotionally unraveled fast.

This week, her behavior and thinking became deeply concerning. Here’s a breakdown of what we’ve observed:

---

Delusions of Grandeur and Spiritual Themes

She says she’s had a revelation and now understands the true nature of life and the universe.

She talks constantly about frequencies and resonance, and says the solution to global suffering is for everyone to ""resonate with love"" at the same time.

She believes she’s the person to lead this awakening, that she has the charisma and courage to change the world.

She plans to write a book that will “awaken everyone.”

Says people who disagree are “sleepwalking”, and that “we’ll all understand soon.”

Believes she can manifest anything, including winning the lottery.

Claims her eyesight is healed, and her glasses are now blurry because she no longer needs them.

---

Disordered Thinking and Magical Logic

She questioned whether 1 + 1 equals 2, arguing in another universe it might not.

She believes people on the street are drawn to her energy, and that they “feel” her presence and wave back.

Repeatedly says we don’t understand because we’re not “vibrating at her level.”

---

Loss of Insight

Admitted that if one of her halfway house clients said these things, she’d hospitalize them — but insists she’s different because she believes it’s true.

Took over a call with a nurse at 811 and convinced them she was just misunderstood and spiritually joyful.

Told me she’s “happy” and that others want to “put her down” because they can’t understand.

Said “you don’t understand now, but you will. We all will.”

---

Other Key Signs

Went more than 24 hours without sleep, possibly longer, but remained hyperverbal and energized.

Has been watching spiritual-science and consciousness videos obsessively (black holes, quantum energy, metaphysics).

At times, her speech becomes word salad — metaphor-heavy, disjointed, and difficult to follow.

---

After several days of escalating symptoms, she finally agreed to go to the hospital  and packed a bag. She’s calm, but still fully immersed in the belief system described above.


---

My Ask

Does this sound like mania with psychotic features, or more likely schizoaffective or late-onset psychosis?

Has anyone seen someone with long-term managed depression suddenly break this hard?

For loved ones: How do you stay involved when the person sees themselves as spiritually awakened, not sick?

Any insight is appreciated. I’m exhausted and doing everything I can to help her get proper care and stay safe.

1mav89i,What type of therapy?,"Hi guys, coming to you with a question. I’ll try to give a brief description of my issue. About 4 years ago I already did EMDR-therapy to overcome trauma relating to wind, as it triggered me really badly, this related to my hair blowing away from my forehead as I had tons of zits and a big forehead. Before the therapy, I got sick of it at the time and then decided to just cut off my hair, going buzzcut. My then girlfriend - now wife - demanded I let it grow so I decided to take EMDR to be able to take it. I was ok for about 4 years but the trauma has recently kinda resurfaced and I’m going crazy trying to find a fix for it. I decided to let it go for now, as I’m on vacation, but I really wanna resolve this for once and for all. So I’m going to go back to a psych once I return. My question is: which type of psychologist would you recommend for this? My symptoms are that I feel anxiety sometimes when exposed to AC, wind etc, while I have also been fine under these circumstances. I feel confident when there’s no wind, so it’s real frustrating. I also have a daughter now so I want to be able to be the strongest version of myself I possibly can for her. I’ve been trying internet suggestions but they keep saying I can’t logically treat this because when I formulate a reaction to try and ‘fix’ the tension, I create a feedback loop where I force myself to brace for something negative, which does make sense I guess. I assume now over the past few days being heavily confronted with this thing that the anxiety is primarily a physical response, as rationally I don’t hide my forehead anymore or anything, I just let my hair grow and put it upright. There’s a feeling that screams as well that if I just go buzzcut again I’ll solve my issue.

1mav4nm,Help on “trauma”," So basically I went on this study vacation some time ago to that should’ve had lasted 2 weeks  , I was having the time of my life and one night halfway through our trip me and my roommates decided  to do buy and consume edibles , (I’ve never done any type of drug in my life before this) . I took 60 mg of edibles and what happened after is something I’m having a real hard time to describe, basically this guy I was in the room with started playing tricks on me and I think that’s what made me downward spiral into the things I’m going to describe.
The guy was also high and I think he was making me do a game they do with people who are high, the fact is I went crazy, I was in complete paranoia. We later went to sleep , and maybe it was because I was still high I felt like he was recording me and messing with me , I got up and took a shower and went roaming the place that hosted us. I was completely gone mentally, I thought that I was in a dream, I got in altercations with the guards thinking , as I said, I was in a lucid dream, I even fell from 5 meters thinking I wouldn’t get hurt. Overall making some serious mistakes. Cops and paramedics were called , while this was happening I kept hallucinating, I ended up in an hospital and had to go back to my country the day after. 

I have some questions I want to ask you :
I’m having trouble sleeping at night rethinking the stupid things I’ve done, how do I fix this?
My friends are coming back from their vacation today , word got around and they asked my roommate what had happened to me but he didn’t answer  them, I’m thinking about addressing the situation to them tomorrow, is that a good think to do? 
Lastly, should I consult a therapist? ",1753644328.0,2025-07-27 19:25:28+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mav4nm/help_on_trauma/

1maupbc,What would you do?,"TW: CSA, abuse, mention of diagnosis

I (25) have been dealing with this for as long as I can remember. There was never a point where I was okay. Every second I’m conscious, I’m in psychological pain. I don’t have “bad days,” I have one endless state of being, and it’s unbearable.
I'm in a situation where I genuinely don’t know what to do, and I’d really appreciate honest advice from people who’ve been through something similar or just have perspective.


My diagnoses:
- complex PTSD
- severe depression
- social anxiety (that just flared up severely thanks to recent events)
- binge eating disorder
- ADHD
(- possible undiagnosed autism)
(- subclinical narcissistic traits)


I have long-term trauma. My life is limited by CPTSD symptoms, executive dysfunction, chronic dissociation, and a level of social anxiety that makes it impossible to exist normally. I can’t function, completely exhausted, unable to do basic tasks.
When I try to do something, even just getting up or brushing my teeth, something in me shuts off and goes dead. No amount of willpower fixes this. And the more I push myself, the worse it gets.

I’ve been kicked out of a trauma-focused inpatient clinic recently. Because I was “too sick” for their program. Too ill for therapy.
Since then, no outpatient therapists or clinics have offered anything remotely helpful or stable. Some don’t call or message back, others act like I’m too complicated. I’m just passed around like a problem no one wants to deal with.

I live alone. My parents were always emotionally and psychologically abusive. They ignore everything about my mental state and only ever reach out when they want something.
They’ve never shown actual care, only control. And when I don’t act how they want, they guilt trip or punish me.
They act like they “don’t understand” why I’m not closer to them. I can't just go no contact with them as I somewhat rely on them financially. If the government decides to not pay me anymore, they will be all I have. And on a social basis, they are all I have.

I can’t work. I don’t have the mental or physical stability to function even part-time. But I only get minimal government support, which isn’t enough to live on.
I’m constantly broke, constantly stressed about money, and unable to apply for better benefits because I can’t get the energy or focus to get through the paperwork. I don’t have friends I can rely on financially or emotionally. It’s just me. It always has been just me.

I’m stuck in survival mode 24/7. I’ve already been through three clinics, tried multiple therapists, multiple medications, self-help, official support systems. None of it worked. Not even slightly. People keep saying “reach out” or “ask for help,” but I’ve done that.
And the result is usually: No response, or people telling me “you just have to try harder"", or ""I'm too difficult of a case"", and I end up worse than before.

This isn’t a temporary crisis. I'm alone, too exhausted to keep fighting.
I don’t want to go in a closed ward. They don’t offer real therapy. Locking me up won’t fix any of my issues. It will just make me feel more powerless, more broken, and more alone.

1maufb6,My Crisis Prevention Failsafe: A Successful Playlist (and how to build your own),"I went through a major mental health crisis years ago, and while I am never completely out of the dark, things have improved (despite what is going on in the world). But there is one thing that I have been curating since that time that has helped me tremendously when I have moments of being close to the edge: a video playlist.

This playlist can take me from “today is my last day” to “let’s give it another shot.” I get a little bit of clarity, strength, and hope every time I watch it, just enough to climb out of the pit of darkness. And it is 100% catered to me. I started with just a few, but now it has more than 40 videos.

—-

If you are like me and are moved by media (music, videos, etc.), here is how you make your own:

1. Choose a platform you use the most. For me it was YouTube, but you can use a music app or other streaming/social media app of your choice. Make a playlist, name it what you want.

2. As you use the app, if you see/hear something that makes you extra happy or makes you laugh (SPECIFICALLY to the point where you temporarily forget your problems) IMMEDIATELY add it to the list. If liking or commenting is an option, feel free to leave something that you know you may see later.

3. That’s it. Don’t worry about it making sense or being in a certain order (unless the order enhances the list somehow). Don’t worry about the length, it could be 8 seconds or 8 minutes. Just add it. 


Strict Rules: 

1. ZERO things that “should” make you happy, but don’t, should be on this list. This list is about what you actually like/love, not what you should like. Nothing that will make you feel guilty or emotional either, unless the emotion is a good one. 

2.  Choose things that you know will inspire a positive emotion 100% of the time, no exceptions. This should be a playlist you don’t have to worry about - only things safe for your brain and health when you have very little control left to think about it. 

3. ONLY use this list when you NEED it, not just want it. The list will become less special if you use it frequently - watch/listen to it when you have very little other choices and you know you are spiraling. Treat it like a lifeline.

4. DO NOT SHARE IT. I mean you could, but a quick way for something we love to be ruined is to share it with someone and then they say something that changes how we look at it forever. This playlist is about you - don’t let anyone else’s opinion ruin it. 

5. The MOMENT something on the list doesn’t make your mood better, remove it. Don’t even think about it. This list is for emergencies so everything on it needs to work.

6. Finally, don’t rush it. Don’t go looking for these videos/songs unless you already know exactly which one you wanna add. Rushing it WILL frustrate you (please trust me on this). In the meantime, stick to things you already know bring you a little bit of happiness.


—-

I have been using it more often lately (once every 1-2 months as opposed to every 1-2 years) and it has made me very thankful that I decided to make it years ago. 

My playlist looks chaotic, but it’s perfect for me. Some videos have a couple things in common, but people likely wouldn’t understand what I specifically enjoy about them. And that’s no one’s business but mine.

If this doesn’t work for you, use this as a blueprint to find your own failsafe. We all need something when no one is around to save us - this is just what works for me.

1mau98d,I AM LOSING INTERESTS,"It's been about more than 3 years that i feel very uninterested and irritated. I know that you cannot force an interest, you have to genuinely feel love for it (for example, you cannot learn chess by forcing it without having a love for it no matter how many matches you lose). But the problem is I DO NOT LOVE ANYTHING.  
If i apply the above theory, I can have no interest in any activity until i find that i am forcefully doing it these few days. I start questioning if i enjoyed it then the true answer comes ""maybe i am doing it to look cool and impress others"". I have almost tried everything from books, chess, beat making, coding, golf, hiking, calisthenics, travelling, teaching...... to even politics and beyond.   
And turns out what, the only part of the day i enjoy is watching youtube videos.....and a lot of em.  
I even find it so hard to understand my own feelings and express them. I have been trying to write this post for about an hour lol but do not know what i truly feel the problem is like. This is making me irritated.

Eventually, I feel so irritated, angry and anxious all the time. I can't talk to any stranger without my hands shaking.  

P.S. Sorry if my english is immature. And also please do not suggest therapy as i cannot afford it (unemployed). ",1753642245.0,2025-07-27 18:50:45+00:00,0,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mau98d/i_am_losing_interests/

1mau0dh,Emotionally drained from a relationship with my mother,"My family doesn't normally do anything for my birthday. Sometimes we have dinner. This is something I'm used to. My birthday is on Monday. In the past we would do something leading up to it. However, this year my dad decided to go fishing during the weekend of my birthday. At first I was upset about it and I voiced this. However, I quickly forgot about that because I started to make plans for myself. For example, I'm going to the movies today. I'm getting a massage on Monday (my actual birthday). I will probably go to the movies after my massage again tomorrow. I will make this a routine every year. 

What I didn't expect was for my mom to still be upset at me for initially being upset. Keep in mind that I voiced my disappointment for all of two minutes. This was on Friday. It is now Sunday. She is now using every excuse she can to say that I am ""upset"". I have talked to her nicely for the whole weekend and let them both know that I don't want to do anything for my birthday. This is primarily because I had immediately started making my own plans (movies). I have expressed time and time again that I don't care if they do anything. I have planned my own stuff. Ever since then she has taken every chance to start an argument. Today I was getting ready to go on the road and while I brushing my teeth and using my water flosser, I couldn't respond. She immediately got upset and said that I wasn't responding because I was upset about my birthday. My mouth was full of water. I'm choking and ran when you called. She was carrying over the fact that I don't care whether they do anything into that very minor and stupid situation. 

For context, my mom spends most of her time alone. I have never seen her have any friend groups. She sometimes talks to people on the phone whom she has worked with but that's about it. She doesn't do anything or go anywhere and she has always tried to get me to be the exact same. I will not be doing the same. I have seen what not having a community has done. It makes some bitter and resentful. I feel that I have tried to remain close to her because I feel like she doesn't do much. However, it is now draining me. This feels like it's my dad's job and not mine. 

She will soon be all she has for company, especially company that is by choice. My dad has people he fishes with and hangs out with regularly. I also have people I hang out with. She routinely tells me not to hang out with people and she can never give a good reason why. I know it's because she is unhappy with her life. This shows especially when my dad is going to hang out with his friends and she will out of the blue say, ""I'm going to start going places and doing things."" Mind you, no one is stopping her. 

She has had narcissistic tendencies for as long as I could remember. Very notable memories were before the age of 10 when she would routinely ask me if I wanted her and I to live somewhere else whenever her and my dad got into an argument. I would say, ""No because dad would be by himself."" Looking back this explains my trauma response now. It's fawning. I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable so I didn't used to let my emotions known. However, I always bear the brunt of people's emotions. She has been manipulating me like this for my whole life. She brings EVERYTHING back to her.

I'm in the process of getting in a program for a career change. It's been difficult. I just want to move on with my life and keep this relationship at arm's length.

1mau0ah,What's wrong with me,"Whenever I change my environment,  my day is different from my daily routine I get this super weird feeling. I don't know what to call the feeling of it, it isn't similar to any of the ones I know. I just feel uncomfortable and disconnected of myself. Im known for having difficulties of adaptation. 
My parents are divorced and whenever I go to the other parent, I always feel uncomfortable for the first few days, after that it goes away, but when I have to return again to my other parent, once again i got this weird feeling in my stomach that won't go away. 
Sometimes I feel like my mind is not connected to my body and I live my own different little life in my brain, and another one with my body. I genuinely don't know what to do, I'm starting to get scared. I don't understand what's wrong with me. Sometimes I even just randomly realize that I'm alive and just get super aware of my life/surroundings. When this happens I usually get semi panic attacks. I've tried explaining this to the people I trust but none of them understood what I'm talking about and refuse to take me to a physiatrist. 
I've been experiencing this for a few years now, and I've even started to self-harm in the past, as a coping mechanism, to make myself feel more alive/connected to myself, but I knew it was wrong to do so, so eventually I succeeded to stop. I've been just surpressing it and try not to think about it recently but Its starting to get bad again. I have no idea how to express myself or how to explain what's going inside of me because I genuinely can't tell myself. All I know is that it feels bad and weird and I'm scared. If someone understands, has some ideas what it could be, or even knows what I should do in this situation, please comment, I'll take any advice that could help, I just don't want to feel this way anymore.",1753641647.0,2025-07-27 18:40:47+00:00,0,1,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mau0ah/whats_wrong_with_me/
1matu42,My anxiety is ruining me,"Dont know where to start so Ill start at the beginning I guess. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14 after a hospitalization. I was on mainly zoloft, buspar, and bupropion for years. Im 20 now. I stopped taking them cold turkey around November/December 2024. I also heavily smoke weed and have done so since 13. My anxiety lately has skyrocketed. 

I just graduated community college with an associates degree and I am transferring to a university for my bachelor’s. I have a job that I really wanted and pays okay. I feel like I should be proud of myself or at least content but I feel so overwhelmed and anxious and terrified every single day. I feel intense guilt over EVERYTHING. As soon as I wake up, I feel stressed because Im wondering what I have to do or what I should do. If I dont do what I tell myself I should do that day, I beat myself up about it. I end up overwhelmed with the imaginary tasks I give myself and just stay in bed all day. I feel lazy and gross. I feel like I am pathetic and disgusting because I do not clean up everyday or keep up with my laundry or eat well or keep up with personal hygiene. Every day it feels like another huge tasks just to figure out what I want to eat or do. Even on days that I work. I work 9-5 and get home around 6, then I cant just relax. I feel like I need to do something productive or else Im horrible. I dont know where it comes from

I am about to put in my two weeks at work. Its a stressful job working with autistic children and I cant do it during school. But then I will have to move in to university housing in august and get a new job and adjust to my class schedule and meet new people and got to events and clubs. I am so terrified. I will be completely alone once my family drops me off. My plan a few months ago was to live with my bf but he cheated again and I called off those plans and kicked him out of my parents house whwre he was living with me. 

It was hard enough being a child with all this anxiety and constant underlying depression, but now that I am an adult with adult responsibilities, I feel like I am not cut out for this. How do people remember all the shit they have to do? How do people work everyday and still keep up with laundry? And meals? And hygiene? And cleaning?

And the guilt is almost debilitating. I dont know why I feel so ashamed all of the time, but I do. I apologize for everything. I feel like if something goes wrong, it was all my fault and everyone is mad at me. 

I cant keep up with anything and time moves way too fast. I have to work tomorrow and Im already feeling like Ive run out of free time (its 2:30pm and I just had a week long vacation) and I keep thinking my move to uni is next year or something. I move in three weeks. I just want to cry and curl up like a baby and give up on everything. 

Sorry just kinda rambling/venting. Does anybody else feel insanely anxious and guilty every single day? How do you survive adult life? I am so terrified of fucking everything up.

1maszzu,I don’t know if anyone will see this but I feel so alone and scared,"Excuse my grammar 
I’ve started school yesterday but I’ve had this subconscious thought for a while now that “if my anxiety or any mental health problem happens in school that means I’m actually mentally unstable and it’s BAD” and I have become extremely sensitive to the tiniest of things I randomly get triggered now because of it and today in class my eyes were feeling heavy because it was the first day of school and my night routine is messed up but out of nowhere I started to get anxious because of that ???? Like what it’s literally just my eyes feeling heavy and suddenly I became aware of my anxiety which sends this sudden rush of anxiousness and I HATE that rush honestly it makes my blood rush and I can feel my surroundings becoming more real in a bad way and later when I randomly calm down I’m like “oh it’s so easy it’s obviously just in my head and I need to calm down” But I don’t know why it doesn’t click like that when I’m actually going through it yk and it’s very very very scary I dislike it so much and now I’m not PARANOID but I am scared that this will continue to happen in school and it makes me feel weird because my friends are around me and they’re fine I feel like the crazy or mentally unstable one and it’s just such a horrible feeling and I don’t know if it’s the anxiety that’s there because of summer break or smth else although I think it’s the first option tbh and idk if this will go away slowly but I’m really scared that this will happen in school and it makes me feel so WOKE for some reason like I literally feel crazy even tho my only problem is anxiety and if I have to be honest I never though anxiety could get this bad and now I don’t even know what to do to make myself better because it’s this random rush of anxiousness that hits me and suddenly I become aware of it which makes me feel worse and even more scared. I don’t want to hurt myself because of this and I’m so scared.I want to be normal when I grow up I’m just 15 and I don’t know anyone else around me who goes through this and even if they do it’s never as intense as me and they don’t help because whenever I open up to them they only say like “i understand” I get it some people cannot help but stuff like that makes me feel worse and I regret opening up to people because of that.",1753639240.0,2025-07-27 18:00:40+00:00,2,3,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maszzu/i_dont_know_if_anyone_will_see_this_but_i_feel_so/

Then forcefully, I have to forget everything and talk to him normally like nothing happened only then will he respond to me.

1masee8,"Help Me With Some Insight? Not looking for a diagnosis, just some help","Hi. 22f. This is a throw away account. I feel so insane making a post about this but this has been driving me slowly insane and I really need some insight into whats going on. For personal reasons, I cannot access a mental health care provider or anything similar. I just feel crazy right now and I don't know if its in my head or something is actually wrong with me... I feel like something has been wrong my entire life (or for as long as I can remember) so i am now feeling frustrated with the answers of ""this is just media sensitivty"" or ""its your period cycle"" or ""its just your phone. this is nothing and put the phone down."" while i acknowledge that these are valid factors, something else just feels *off.* and i feel like im going insane that its not being address.

Woah okay what a start. Sorry if that scared anyone away hahaha. Okay but now for the symptoms of what I am experiencing my heart is legit pounding while typing this out. Im dramatic asf.

I have never been the best sleeper, but i somewhat fixed it going into university and prior to 2025, was getting at least a full seven hours of sleep at night. Around six months ago, I started to experience a dramatic change in my sleeping patterns. I have always been a night owl, so I was still going to bed around midnight - two thirty in the morning (earliest class was at 11:30), but even without and alarm i would wake up in between 5 - 6 AM without fail, and feel this rush of cortisol into my body. I am able to fall back asleep tho but its a fitful sleep with super intense dreams that relate directly to my life. If i try to go to bed earlier, I wake up at 2:30 AM AND 5 - 6 AM with and without an alarm. When this was happening at university I did not think much of it, I just thought it was stress from the semester or something. But i have been home for two months now and it hasnt changed. Along with the sleeping irregularities, I have been clenching my jaw in my sleep non stop. Sometimes I wake up and my mouth is bloody, and the dentist told me recently my back teeth are cracked from how often i clench.

The next thing that changed was my cycle in March. It has always been five days, might be two days late or two days early, but always five days with consistent bloodflow until the fourth day then i transition to spotting. My cycle has now been cut down to three days with heavily flow an then spotting on the second day. This month had the most change with my cycle being almost 8 days late. Has never happened before. Super weird.

I started to get obsessed with death and grief. I would read grief help books like I was trying to prepare myself to mourn my family. I had dreams they were going to die all the time. I would obessivly look up stats of things like ALS, TBIs, and other freak accidents and would analyze each of my loved ones by their demographics. For example, I have an uncle that is close to me who is: white, between the ages of 55-75, works out a lot almost to the point over working himself so he is the person in my life who is most likely to get ALS. Or people dying in their sleep I have a huge fear of that. As of right now everyone in my life is healthy and fine.

I have other symptoms but its too long to type so im going to list em:

Weird patterns and habits (putting car in park at a red light bc im scard breaks will fail)

Crying spells, panic attacks

needing reassurance from others ""are u mad at me?"" since childhood. Is eroding relationships.

I have more symptoms too. Lmk.",1753637822.0,2025-07-27 17:37:02+00:00,0,0,mentalhealth,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1masee8/help_me_with_some_insight_not_looking_for_a/

1mas2lx,"Not sure if I’m being coerced/abused or not, and it’s lowkey draining the life out of me","I (20f) used to be really close with this guy (21m). We were best friends. At least that’s what I thought. Maybe we still are? He says we are.

A few years ago, when we were 18, he told me after a year of being really close to one another and after he’d been really fresh out of his break up that he only wanted me in his bed and nothing more. It hurt a lot because I told him he was my only friend. He told me, verbatim:

“So this is the last time we talk or…”

4 months later he span back, brushed it off like it was a joke and said, verbatim, over text:

 “sowwy, I made a mistake by saying that idkw.” It took me months of pushing him away though, I didn’t really forgive him on the spot.
I still stayed close to him because I love him. 

He’d tell me I had the most special place in his heart, but he never wanted to commit. He said it was because of his avoidant attachment style, and that it came from being hurt by his ex.

He also lied about dating someone. Told me she was his girlfriend when they’d barely gone on four dates dates. 

At one point he told me he sees people as positives or negatives. Like if someone adds value to his life or not. Basically like tools. He said he thinks he’s an awful person.

One night, toward the end of last year, we were in bed watching a movie. We started kissing. He asked if he could give me hickeys and I said no. Later, I told him I didn’t want to go any further and he said okay. But then he kissed me again, flipped me over, and bit my chest through my clothes hard enough to leave a mark. I had literally just told him I didn’t want any marks and I didn’t want to go further. I laughed it off in the moment because I didn’t know what else to do.


Another time he offered to go down on me and I said I wasn’t interested. After that, he told me he didn’t want to kiss me anymore or be affectionate with me in any capacity, but still wanted to hang out. The next time we saw each other, he kissed me anyway. I kissed him back for a second and then pulled away because I remembered his boundary which I don’t know why he crossed. I was upset and almost cried. He apologized and said he should’ve communicated better. Later, after I explained how I felt, we kissed again.


A month later, he asked me to send a pic of myself in a bra. And I did. I regret it now. I felt pressured. I didn’t want him to get cold or distant with me again.


After that, weeks later,  he sent me a meme that said “I love beer and boobies.” I said “me too” as a joke. Then he said “one beer and two boobies please.” I played along at first but then he said “look at yours then let me see them too.” I tried to laugh it off and said “get a load of this guy,” but he kept going. When I finally said no, he got cold and distant again.

I asked what was wrong and he said I was roasting him. Then he asked what’s with the teenage rebellion, which surprised me?? I said Was I obedient? He said no, but you never used to be confrontational. Later he admitted he just didn’t like being rejected. I asked if I should’ve said yes, and he just went silent and said “nothing. never mind.”

I keep thinking about all of this. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic or if this was actually messed up. Was this manipulation? Was it coercion? Was I just too passive?

1marpgz,"Acute and transient psychotic disorder at 18 years old, four psychosis in the past 10 month","Okay so im 18 year old. I live in eastern europe so mental health isnt realy a big thing here like the care you can get in western europe, usa etc…

I have had 4 psychosis’es in the past 10 month. They diagnosed me with “acute and transient psychotic disorder” alongside autism, bpd and most recently bipolar.

My problem is that im an addict and whenever i drink alcohol (my drug of chocie) in a period of time (everyday around 1 to 2 weeks) i get “command halluciations” or idk which is the best term, basically i hear my ex girlfriend in my head saying im a worthless person, etc… really dark things.

Whenever im in stressfull life situation i “only” see shadow figures, like a shadow or multiple people in the corner of my eyes. When i  look at them they dissapear, but if i want to do something and don’t look directly at them they are in the corner of my eyes with glowing white eyes.

In my first two psychotic episode i was hospitalized, they gave me antipsychotics and it reduced my hallucinations. Still i was in locked department / unit of the psych ward for around 2 weeks each of the two psych ward visits. But still, weekly i see shadow people. Like a few times a week for a few hours, then they dissapear. 

I dont know how to live with this disorder. My last psychosis no one knew about it. It wasnt too out of touch with reality so i didnt tell my family about it, and they didnt even notice i was different or something. I just got thru it by myself. Antipsychotics made the hallucinations dissapear after some time. 

If anyone has been thru something similar, how do you cope with this disorder? ",1753636206.0,2025-07-27 17:10:06+00:00,3,2,mentalhealth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1marpgz/acute_and_transient_psychotic_disorder_at_18/

I've been trying to date but have only gotten 2 dates in a year. I get no matches and no likes from normal people. I have had bad self esteem from a very young age due to bullying and am now in therapy for it.

I just want to die man. I will never be enough for anyone. I've been told by multiple people that I'm ugly. I have been going to the gym for 5 years and noone can tell. I even tried to input my pictures to an GPTand it told me I have no chances at Tinder and I'm much worse looking than my friends😂 I have so many bad thoughts in my head. I believe I deserve to suffer. For the last few days I've been hitting myself with metal pipes but even that won't help anymore. I will never be wanted by women in my life.

If society really wants me to get better so they can exploit my labor more and continue turning me into a wage slave, then maybe they should make it easier to not >!kill yourself!<.

1mar9pr,AITAH for being upset with my partner?,"Hey all, I don't want to make any rash decisions or say anything out of place if i'm in the wrong here. For some context I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half, we're pretty opposite as people but it's always been a positive. He's very chilled, laid back, likes his own time, likes being at home. I'm very full on, i like to plan, i'm quite clingy in relationships etc. But we balance each other out amazingly.

This past few weeks i've been suffering with my mental health extremely badly. I've not felt this way in a long time and (TW) have even gone as far as having su!cidal thoughts. I won't go into the details or why i feel this way, but i've communicated it with him. I feel incredibly incredibly alone at the minute, i don't have friends (other than 1 who's busy at the minute), i don't have a good family. I only have him.

Now, i've not wanted to overwhelm him with my problems or make him feel as though he has to ""fix them."" Which is a tendency i used to fall into when i was younger and didn't understand how to control my own emotions. All i've asked for is some company, to see him, have a cuddle, talk. Just some time so i can atleast feel less alone. He picked up some overtime this morning and yesterday at work so i didn't see him all weekend. He came home today, had a nap for about two hours and then text me. 

I asked if i could come and see him tonight, even just for two or three hours (we both have work tomorrow) and he said no because he just wants to chill tonight. I haven't seen him in a week and it feels like he just doesn't care or understand how awful i'm feeling. Normally if he wanted some time to himself i'd happily leave him to it but - if the roles were reversed - no matter how tired i was i'd be there for him? I'd drop anything just to make him feel LESS alone. 

He's said he'd see me tomorrow - but it's not about seeing him anymore that's bugging me with this, it's the principal of it. I don't feel like you should have to ask your partner multiple days in a row for support and be set a specific day because they're ""tired"" (after a nap) and want to chill out ... it's the exact same as what we'd do together, it wouldn't detriment him but it's making me feel so much worse.

I am a minor, living in a small town (around 20 000 people) in the start of the polar zone lol, so mental health care isnt our biggest priority.

Now i dont really wanna die, it just hurts too much being alive. My parents are amazing, maybe a bit strict sometimes but inside i love them. I have an amazing bestfriend who is basically me but blonde and 12 cm taller (yes, that is crazy). She supports me through all this and im so thankful for that.

I suffered from some work setback recently and just find that 

do they know they have disrespected people ?

when they could say 'hey you are right but since my family has this situation , could u please just try your best to help but if you can't, that's alright. ' then they just fucking leave and get the fuck out of my face and my business. 

when im polite to them and when I set boundary when people disrespect me , why am I the one who should suffer emotionally after they , in return, put their fingers at me when im the one who is disrespected !

God knows. Hell . 

I just kind of think that , sometimes, the work setback like this, which could trigger people's anxiety and rumination (or the resulted depression) is just , as well as the suffering of the mental diseases , is just part of the script that God knows who has written for us to go through . No matter what kind of choice I make, I think that I may have to go through the same shit but just somewhere else with some other people .

1maq6ed,She left with a text. It's been 5 years.,"Hey everyone. I'm not here to seek solutions  because after many years I realize it is hard for anyone else to become me to emphasize with my heartache and grief, but this is me trying to find some semblance of closure. If anyone is interested in hearing me out, I would like to share and let out years worth and express myself and perhaps it can resonate with some of you who might feel the same way. And please pardon my poetics.

I have tried in the past, oh so many times, through talking with family friends, therapy and even online here time to time. I wish it was that textbook easy. It made me appreciate the beauty of human communications and the emotional capacity and sides I have never seen before. But at the end of the day, these are just sympathetic ears.

I wanted so badly for the pain to really matter externally, to be validated in the same weight I hold, to be put on trial and executed with the justice it deserves with a third party alongside me, equally distraught and mad with grief as I imagine they would say, 'Jesus, you went through all this?', to which I would reply inside my head in a corny, dramatic scenario - 'Yes, all this time since then.'

My one insight after looking deep inside of it all is that at its core, it is the loss of privilege of being intimately known in a way only this specific person has known me. I feel disoriented, carrying all the euphoria of my memories and weight without a witness. A real witness to be put on a pedestal, upon which only those who treaded my memories would step on. To acknowledge the precious commodity that is my memories with her in the times I made so much personal growth and achievements, and treasure them like gold bars, and silently mourn like I have been.

It is so deeply suffocating having to convey all this, as I feel silly as if explaining to someone the distraught one might feel from falling in love with a woman in last night's dream.

A long time ago love. There are so many like it, but this person I called mine, with all her flaws, nuances, contexts and identities we built together  - I struggle to convey all of it.

I appreciate and cherish all the experiences I have had with her, her being as a person, and all that she might have offered in another reality. And to be honest, I would experience it all over again if I could, even if the ending is still where I am now.

But I just can't help it, even if hurts so much, even if all this time has passed. ",1753632587.0,2025-07-27 16:09:47+00:00,6,4,mentalhealth,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maq6ed/she_left_with_a_text_its_been_5_years/
1mapii2,Stop using my disorder for a silly mood.,"Hi, I’m F16. I have severe, diagnosed anxiety, not just “oh I’m a little nervous sometimes.” I have the worst symptoms and attacks so intense it has caused me to faint several times in the years and not leave my house at all for 2 years so far. This is a serious brain disorder that has had a crazy impact on my life. My nerve system is completely broken and shattered. I always see undiagnosed people use it for when they’re nervous, lonely etc. And honestly? it drives me insane. Because this isn’t some casual feeling you can just shrug off or scroll past on social media. This is real, it’s medical, and it’s devastating. When people toss around “anxiety” like it’s a mood or a way to get attention, they erase the actual hell that comes with this every day. I’m not here to compete or invalidate anyone’s feelings, but stop stealing the word from those of us who’s brains and bodies are literally on fight mode all the time. If you’re just nervous or lonely or anything in the vocabulary, say that. Don’t use my illness as something to sound relatable. Because this is my reality, and it deserves to be taken seriously. It can’t when people toss the word around. So please, think before you say “anxiety” because for some of us it’s not a feeling, it’s a disorder that’s destroying us every day.

1mapi1z,I have everything I need in life but I feel empty and lost,"I'm 25, close to finishing college, I have a roof over my head, good people around me, no drama, no major problems, my family is healthy… and yet I feel like I'm trapped in a cage I built myself.

On the outside, people see me as a caring, kind person. They often tell me I'm beautiful, good-hearted and that I have everything going for me… but I can't see any of that myself. I tend to overthink everything, I care too much, I worry about everything, and I'm a perfectionist. Deep down I struggle with low self-esteem, I often feel less worthy than others, and I constantly feel like I'm not enough.

I notice I protect myself too much from the possibility of getting hurt. Because of that, I avoid situations that could potentially be painful, even if they might be good for me. I feel like I'm very self-aware and I know where most of these feelings are coming from, but I can’t seem to break free from them. I know this is a process, but I’m scared because I don’t know what the outcome will be.

I also struggle with intrusive and negative thoughts. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, but I know that’s just another way of running away from this situation. I did reach out for help: a psychiatrist diagnosed me with adjustment disorder and mild depression, and I’m currently in therapy. We’re still at the talking stage and haven’t started any deeper work yet.

Every day I wake up with a negative cloud over me. One negative thought is enough to throw me back down again. Even when I feel happy or motivated for a moment, I remind myself that I'm ""actually feeling bad"" and I go back to that dark place.

I compare myself to people online who share their lives and I feel invisible because I don't. I get jealous when others are happy or doing something new, and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.

I know I should ""work on myself"" but I have no motivation. I feel like my life is on pause, like I'm just surviving, and I'm scared I'll stay this way forever. I don’t know who I am or what I want from life.

Maybe I’m just lost in my 20s because “adult life” is really starting now. Does anyone else feel like this? Has anyone managed to get out of this cycle? Is there truly a way out? And why do we as humans do this to ourselves – why does the brain create problems when everything is “okay”? 

Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot. Thanks ♡

And then when my wife left me, after years of believeing it was possible to find someone who really got and understood me, I started to question like maybe they're, not right, but not entirely wrong. Like 98% wrong, but still, 1 or 2 % more right than I'd thought.

I still stand by that assessment, especially with recent escalation on their part.

But now my identity is standingbin question: Who am I? How do I respond to conflict? Is my very existence valid and how can I externally validate that and learn to share that with a partner again after everything that happened to get exactly here?

I can't lie, there is a level of excitement to starting my life over, but it's so clouded by hurt and distrust and I wonder if I'll ever be happy and whole again.

I feel like a piece of my heart's missing.

I want to be more uplifting, but sometimes just sitting with your feelings and listening to other's is the best you can do in tough to say the least situations.",1753630036.0,2025-07-27 15:27:16+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1map3pk/smoke_mirrors_fade/

I'm currently working on a passion project — a blog that combines **mental health for professionals** and **biohacking / health tech**.

The idea is to create helpful content for people who are juggling demanding jobs and trying to stay sane, productive, and healthy.

Before I dive in, I'd love to hear from you:
- What are the biggest challenges you face in terms of mental health or wellness at work?
- Are there any tools / routines / ""hacks"" that really worked for you?
- What kind of content would you actually find valuable in a blog like this?

Totally open to thoughts, ideas, even criticism.

1maoy14,I can't hold it in anymore,"
Recently, my 3rd semester result came, and the GPA I received was much lower than I had hoped for. I had worked hard throughout the semester, especially trying to recover from a low GPA in my first term. But despite all that effort, the outcome felt like a punch. I was left feeling empty and hopeless, not knowing what direction to take. Weird thoughts and Questions started flooding my mind — how will I stand out now? Who will hire me with a low CGPA? What’s going to happen to my future? I was depressed and I couldn’t bring myself to eat, move, or focus. My anxiety reached a peak, and during all that, I started thinking about someone who has always been a constant support during my toughest moments. That support started to blur into confused feelings, it felt like I might be developing an attachment, maybe even something more. But that person is older than me, and those thoughts only added to my mental chaos. I am feeling overwhelmed, mentally exhausted, and unsure how to make sense of everything happening inside me.

1mansrk,I have had a sh*t teenage years,"Hi all

Thank you for reading this

Im 16 years old now

Lets go back a few years.

6th grade, 13 years old, i was damn ugly man. But when 6th grade ended and summer vacation started, i did a huge glowup and going to 7th grade the girls started, (for the first time in my life liking me)

I was NOT good with relationship, im/i wad the type of guy to send all the damn heart emojis and never talk in real life. Anxious and unsure of whar and how to do, i just ended em all. 

This happened within around like 6 months, this same cycle happened with a few girls

Then around 7th's grade spring, i met a girl really cool, pretty and pretty, wanted in our school and damn she liked me

But this, same damn cycle repeated itself again, i kept talking and barely hugged her. Around when summer came, se was (idk is it cheating cuz he was with another guy with the same time but we were only talking (with all the hearts and that stuff tho)), and his new dude came threatening me and shit to stay away from her, etc.

Moving on to fall, (2023, 7th grade passed and 8th started), i met a sweet pretty girl, she felt like a soulmate. For the first time though, i felt shame of this, cycle shit, so i felt like i was a player and i had to get that off my chest for her so i told her that one night. Next morning i heard she was calling me a player in her school (we're in different schools), and i just, cut her off.

(But that, that me being called a player, caring about my reputation, wanting to be knwon for kindness, i was so damn anxious fo that ever until the start of 2025)

They kept spreading that word like a gospel, other girls from that area started talking to me, then later on f*cking cutting me off and treating me like shit, calling me player too, they just straight up bullied me man. (I wasnt even trying to get any romantic stuff going on with em)

Time flew, just like that, my whole end of 2023,-late 2024 was really ruined because of being so anxious about that. The only time i didnt worry of that was at a Coldplay concert, it was so amazing and life saving

2025, ever until now, ive just wasted, all my long damn years, so badly i hate it that ive been struggling with porn addiction, self hatred, all those rumour things, worrying what people say, worried what my friends talk about me, still being really traumatized of hell beliefs thinking everyone around me would go to hell, its just rough man

And now, just a week ago, i heard a group of girls i dont know who they were, on ome.th called out a pedophile to a person they didnt know was my friend. Oh my holy shit, here we might go again.

What do you guys think i should do? Do i worry too much? Ive been told that too. But, what about these allegiations? People, do they believe it? I know some do, but what if they are those who id have a future with if it these allegiations didnt exist? Whats my future like... idk.",1753626795.0,2025-07-27 14:33:15+00:00,7,4,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mansrk/i_have_had_a_sht_teenage_years/
1manjoa,How to deal with a person who might be lying instinctively?,"So I have a person who is close to me seems to lie instinctively. I saw an old post on here about instinctive lying, and I want some advice.

This person is likely to have depression, but has never been diagnosed properly. I care for them a lot, and we have been through a lot of stuff. We have known each other for about 2 years now, and I found out that they have been not entirely truthful. I caught them once, and found out that the stories they told didn’t quite add up. Because I have trust issues, I blew up on them. The thing is, they tried to make up, and tried to open up more. I think I fucked up by reacting badly when hearing their honest thoughts. These thoughts are a bit brutal, and made me feel angry and hurt. But the way I reacted made them close themselves even further. They told me that lying didn’t make me happy, being truthful didn’t, and they felt stuck.

I admit that sometimes I can be too hard on others. And I often despise lying. From my observation, this person had a rough childhood, and has difficulties opening up to others. Their parents are quite strict, so I guess that they are used to lying. It seems like they would lie (without any thoughts of deception) to avoid feelings of shame or rejection. 

I do want to make them feel safe. But I do sometimes wonder if they’re genuine towards me. I believe that they care about me a lot, but this thing makes me wonder if I really know them. Any advice would be appreciated. If not, I just want to vent.",1753626167.0,2025-07-27 14:22:47+00:00,2,0,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1manjoa/how_to_deal_with_a_person_who_might_be_lying/

1man1ya,Taking shrooms has helped me overcome some very difficult mental health struggles,"I’m 22F. Since 2023, everything started going downhill with my mental health. In April of 2023, I developed an eating disorder that turned into anorexia as a way to cope with how uncontrollable life felt. I was in university and everything was starting to consume me so I needed to feel in control. The only way I knew how, was to control my weight. Fast forward months, I was put into forced recovery because I had lost a considerable amount of weight. But that recovery made me seek control in other ways. That’s when I started bloodletting and self harming pretty badly, nearly everyday.

Because of my self harm, I ended up getting hospitalized in a psych ward for a few months. I was chronically and severely anemic from the blood loss and getting stitches had become something normal for me. At that point, I was stuck in an awful mindset where the only thing that mattered was controlling my body: how much blood I lost, how deep I would cut…

No matter how many times I’ve been to the hospital and seen psychiatrists, I kept stagnating. My case was considered severe because of how likely my behaviours were to eventually kill me. But I didn’t care.

Not until I took shrooms (Golden Teachers). The first time I did it was a micro dose and it helped me realize that my behaviours were not compatible with life. That being said, I kept engaging in self harm pretty badly and regularly, enough that I got sectioned an other time. The interventions put in place to keep me safe and to redirect my “recovery” were not working, mostly because I didn’t care.

But the last time I did shrooms, I took about 3g and that really helped me wake up and see how badly I was destroying myself in order to feel in control of something. It made me realize that I can’t get better if I don’t commit to recovery first. It also made me realize that I only have one body and that if I keep destroying it, eventually it won’t be able to keep up and I’ll die.

I’ve had plenty more realizations that helped me put me back in shape mentally, and now, a few weeks later, I am finally seeing progress in a recovery that I have CHOSEN. This is a big deal because for 2 years, nothing was working. Not the medication, not the psychiatric interventions, not even the raw evidence that my family and friends were suffering while seeing me self destruct.

So I am proud of myself these days for choosing to stay alive and put myself first. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel and I’m forever grateful to have tripped with shrooms enough to wake up and put in the effort to keep living.",1753624922.0,2025-07-27 14:02:02+00:00,2,2,mentalhealth,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1man1ya/taking_shrooms_has_helped_me_overcome_some_very/

1mamn2y,Just a rant,"Hello everyone,
I'm just writing this to rant and get somethings off my chest. Maybe that might help me.
Simply put I feel trapped and am just tired. Tired of putting on a facade and pretending to be something I'm not. I was unlucky enough to be born in a theocracy and unfortunately ended up losing my faith and becoming an atheist( or agnostic, I don't care about labels)
Now everyday I wake up and pretend to be a believer. Most of my decisions are made in accordance to a religion that I don't believe in. I live knowing that everyone I know, who I care for and love, will leave me if they ever found out who I really am and it's slowly killing me inside. I feel alone and hopeless. I think twice before giving my opinion on anything and feel trapped inside my own head. Yes, religion helps many people but I've also seen far too many victims of religion. It's crazy what perfectly reasonable people can do to each other in the name of god. I have no problem with people who follow religion as long as they keep it to themselves, but many here, if not most, see it as a religious duty and their divinely given right to force their beliefs down others throats.
It's been years and I'm slowly losing my mind. I feel angry, sad and desperate. I don't know what to do and honestly just wish I was never born. I don't see anyway out or any chance of things getting better and seeing all the madness around me is making me want to end it all.",1753623835.0,2025-07-27 13:43:55+00:00,2,1,mentalhealth,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mamn2y/just_a_rant/
1mamju2,I escaped one hell (my family) only to end up in another (him),"I’m 25F and just completed my graduation in the medical field. I want to pursue a clinical PG from a government college — extremely competitive, and after speaking with seniors and mentors, I decided to drop a year and prepare full-time (job + prep wasn’t working).

The problem: I come from a toxic household. Constant yelling, emotional abuse, no affection or support — just trauma. I tried staying during my internship in a back room, and it broke me mentally. I’m a sensitive person, and even small things spiral in my head for days. I realized if I want to achieve anything, I need to protect my mental health first.

During a huge fight at home, my boyfriend (25M) told me to move to his city. He promised to support me financially for a year. I asked him multiple times before moving: “Can you afford this? Are you sure you won’t flip later?” He assured me over and over again. I moved, got a hostel, and have been here just a week.

Now comes the problem. He has a serious drinking habit. He turns into a completely different person — aggressive, verbally abusive. Once last year, he even tried choking me during a drunken fight. I was ready to walk away back then, but he begged, promised to stop. He didn’t. We’ve had multiple fights over this. I cried like hell every time.

Last night, he drank again. This morning I called him — no apology. Instead he said,

“I’ll drink. If you have a problem, leave. I don’t drink every day.”

I reminded him of his promise before I moved. He responded with:

“I’ll just send you money monthly. Don’t talk to me.”

I feel betrayed. I gave up a toxic family to escape that environment, and now I’m stuck in a new city, no job, no income, and no one to rely on. I don’t even want relationship advice — I know I can’t fix him, and I don’t expect love from him anymore.

I just need clarity. Should I:
	•	Go back to my toxic home where I know my mental health will crash?
	•	Stay here and keep minimal contact with him, just so I receive monthly support till I get a job, and then cut ties?

Once I get a PG seat, I’ll return his money

I have no close friends, no relatives I can lean on without being reminded of “how much they helped me.” I just want to study 10+ hours a day, get a seat, and get out of all this. But I don’t know how to emotionally survive this year

My girlfriend went out with Gauri and smoked. I was hurt but calm. I told her I quit for her and asked her not to go down that path. She didn’t feel guilty. In fact, she joked that she’ll smoke a whole pack the next day.

When I asked her to at least swear on me that she’ll stop — she refused.

Now she’s blocked me all my accounts. I feel completely broken, like I tried everything to protect her but I got left behind. I didn’t cheat, lie, or control — I just asked her not to destroy herself.

What should I do now? Is there any point in hoping she’ll realise what she’s doing?

Quitting my job and moving wouldn’t be realistic right now—not even sure that would be the right choice in the long run. Trying to live to a quieter neighborhood, which I think may help.

Recently - and I don't know whether this is because I'm a millennial (32F) who scrolls through stuff online and therefore must have ADHD - I get so many adverts/commercials like ""10 signs that you might be a woman with undiagnosed ADHD"" or ""anxious? stressed? did you know that this is one of the KEY TELLTALES of ADHD in women"" etc. Then they're always links to private medication or tech tools/ something that has been monetised. 

I'm concerned that with the rise in actual ADHD diagnoses and the prominence of it in our public discourse, the fact that it's not that well-defined yet (and the tools to treat it medically are still a bit hazy) has left a massive gaping hole in the 'market' for companies to exploit people who feel that something isn't right but they're not sure what it is.

1mal5fo,Fears getting into my way every time,"Hey all, I've been battling with some unspeakable fears which would be too stupid to express. These little mental thoughts come into my way of doing anything. To a degree that they have converted into superstitions of sorts 

Whenever I want to do something..
""X will happen if I do Y""
""Oh, so & so will be there and I will have a bad experience""
""If I go there, I might lose XYZ thing""

Almost instantly, within micro seconds some thought would come up before I do anything. I know those are irrational, banal and I can do it anyway.. but I hate this voice in my head. On some intense days when this voice is strong, it stops me from doing everything. 

Then I lose time and beat myself up over wasting away life like this. 

Please help. Share your experiences and how did you get out of these patterns.",1753619604.0,2025-07-27 12:33:24+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mal5fo/fears_getting_into_my_way_every_time/

1mal3u5,I (18M) feel like I like this girl (19F) TOO much,"I know this sounds stupid, but just bear with me here. I (18M) have been talking to this girl (19F) who I’ll call T for about a week or so now. In that past week, we have spend a good amount of time together, even staying up all night together just talking and watching movies. Nothing sexual, or even anything very romantic has really happened yet, but I just can’t help but have her on my mind all the time. I know this is unhealthy, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to help it. What do I do to slow my feelings down? I don’t want to ruin the relationship by being obsessive or overbearing.

For context, my last relationship was about a year ago, a very messy breakup that ended in her cheating on me and us never speaking again. Since then, I’ve tried to talk to a few girls, none of them leading to any kind of meaningful relationship. I just couldn’t feel anything for anyone, and I figured that was my body telling me that I wasn’t ready for anything serious. I was okay with that.

But that changed when I started talking to T. At first it wasn’t like this, but after the first time we hung out (which was a few days ago at this point) I literally haven’t been able to do anything without having her on my mind. I have had enough self control to not be overbearing, not spam texting her or double texting her if she doesn’t respond for a while, but I would be lying if I said that it hasn’t been difficult to stop myself. 

So what do I do? I don’t want to ruin this by my emotions being out of control, so how do I help how I feel?

1makzkg,I failed to protect somebody.,"I knew my friend was speaking inappropriately to a 12 year old, and didn’t immediately report him. I told him two times beforehand to stop, then I was in a world with them on VrChat, and at one point I muted because I was scared of hearing him say something bad. When he did it again I finally called him out and cut him off I didn’t report him because I thought I had no evidence. I did eventually report him, but I hesitated and cared more about being comfortable than protecting them.

Everyone had told me I was wrong, that it wasn’t a big deal, I convinced myself that I was the problem, that it was just jokes and I was overreacting. After cutting him off, I got other adults opinions, and they told me that it was a wrong situation. But even then, I didn’t report him.

I've always tended to hyper fixate on things, one week I'll do a deep dive into something like jet engines then switch over to a totally new genre of music. I'm also really openminded and like exploring ideas that I don't agree with, just to learn and stuff. 

One of my friends just casually asked me if I was diagnosed and I've been thinking about it since. I didn't really think I was until he brought it up. I also have this habit of slapping my hands against my elbows, I only do it in private but it is different, I guess?

  
I'm not sure if I should even both with getting it diagnosed since it doesn't really affect my life. I don't think having the label is a big deal either...

1make2y,My boyfriend is really depressed,"Hi, my boyfriend (23) and myself (23) have been together since we were 18, almost 5 years. It hasn’t been an easy 5 years but we always try to be better for each other. 
Last October he hurt his back, he was out of work for a long time and ended up having to quit his job permanently, he was a mechanic, and he really liked being a mechanic. Now he works in parts at the same dealership. 
I quit my job an about 2 months ago and started nursing school. My family is funding it and me so it’s not much of a financial burden on him.
He’s doing an online associate degree for finance. Which he enjoys, he’s likes stats and spreadsheets and stuff.
It just seems like every few weeks he gets so incredibly sad and i think he feels hopeless about life. He thought at 23 he would have a cushy job, a house, and money to spare but with our freshman year of college being in 2020 and than dropping out everything kinda went off schedule. I try to tell him that shit is so messed up right now that people in their 30s with a degree can’t even afford a house. We also both still live at home. (Me and my mom get along really well so i honestly like living with her and his mom kinda just leaves him alone most of the time and she’s barely home anyways.) 
He try’s to get new hobbies but than get stressed when he spends money or when he’s not instantly good. He recently started RC planes with has been a frustrating hobby bc many times you crash you have to go and fix it which takes time and money and it’s hard to learn how to fly the thing when crashing it is such an issue.
With nursing school we having been see each other as much but he says he enjoys the alone time which i get. I try to supportive or comforting but i don’t know what i can do beyond that. He knows he she go to therapy but he’s just not ready yet and if he’s not ready therapy won’t do anything

1maexv0,Bouncing back,"So I just recently started regaining my footing and figured I’d share my story. I was in the military just under 20 years. I was deployed a bunch and grinded to hit my retirement. Unfortunately my world turned upside down on the way there. 

Had a chick say I touched her inappropriately during a medical training scenario (I was an instructor) she ended up making this accusation after failing a course a year later (for disciplinary issues) she stated she was suffering from the trauma. Fortunately for me she said this happened in front of the entire class. Her claims were dismissed and I trotted along. Fast forward awhile later my name gets brought up in an unrelated case as a witness (overseas activity) My animosity towards the military investigators had already reached a boiling point and I told them to screw off. Well ironically I found myself dealing with that old complaint shortly after…..except this time they sought to bring criminal charges. The investigator offered to drop it if I cooperated, but my attorney said shut up. 

Well I remained under investigation for over a year and pretty much lost my entire savings keeping up with an attorney. I eventually was told to leave my house after my wife (12 years married) was alienated by the process. ( Divorce further crippled my finances) So I eventually started drinking heavily and was living in my truck. The investigation finally closes out as unfounded, but I never really recovered. I lost my social network, money, housing and my status in the military. I constantly went to seek help, but the providers just dismissed my issues. 

Fast forward a couple months later and I end up getting into a fight with a cop who charged me with a bunch of stuff one night while checking on me( I was an asshole). I end up working a deal to get a honorable discharged, but lost my retirement. So now I’m homeless without a job and most importantly not sleeping. (previously making around 130k a year prior.) Funny enough…..I wanted to get into law enforcement when I retired. The VA sets me up with a coordinator to attempt to get benefits, but I ended up repeatedly denied. 

Fast forward 2 years later and my health starts rapidly diminishing (mostly due to lack of sleep). I really start struggling to maintain my sanity(completely unaware) and eventually get taken in by the local Veterans affairs hospital. I meet a coordinator who assists getting my benefits and started cleaning myself up. Over the course of that year I was able to find a cheap house and recently started going outside venturing out in public again. I still have a long way to go, but I’m no longer trying to kill myself and I can function sober. My friend (the one apart of the other investigation lost his benefits too….18 years service, but he bounced back much better) 

Just wanted to kind of tell my story. I know people go through much worse, I just figured I would let people know there is a way out of the darkness. ",1753596418.0,2025-07-27 06:06:58+00:00,1,0,mentalhealth,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1maexv0/bouncing_back/
1maebg5,How to recover from intense suicidal ideation?,"When I was 18, I was prescribed an SSRI for general anxiety. After 2 days of taking the medication I was hit with the most intense depression imaginable. Suicidal ideation, hopelessness, everything was just extremely dark. I had never experienced any sort of depression before so this was alarming. It didn’t go away at all and resulted in me being hospitalized for intense ideation. After about a year of battling this, I started to feel normal again. That is until I was prescribed accutane in June. Since I felt I had fully recovered from my depression I wasn’t too worried about the side effects. Unfortunately, I was incredibly mistaken and after only 3 weeks on the accutane I have found myself back in the same situation with intense ideation and contemplative thoughts of suicide daily. I think of myself as an optimistic person, and I can say in my normal state that I definitely don’t want to die. But when these waves of acute depression come on it takes me out and makes me question how much longer I can go on. I need another form of treatment for these intense ideations or I won’t make it much longer. Does anyone have any experience with this and have any advice on how to take the edge off of intense lows like this?

TLDR: I’m experiencing intense suicidal ideation daily, I’m starting to lose hope in recovery. Anyone have any recommendations on things they’ve done to lessen this and become stable?

1mabs1a,My Struggles with mental health,"I have just started lexapro, and in the past i’ve had a hard time consistently taking my meds. and i’m trying really hard right now. i am a trans man (21) and i’ve had Major Depressive disorder for a while. maybe since i was 14. and i also have cptsd, and anxiety. 
Recently everything has felt too much. I’m scared of working because of mean managers and rude coworkers. I lost my sister when i was 7 and she was 14. Ever since then i’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression. I’ve gone through so much more trauma, with alcoholic/ addicted parents. 
I tried to do an interview for a gas station. and i had brought up i have a heart condition, so eight hour shifts may be difficult to me. When i had asked for part time over the phone. she had just replied with “i thought you wanted a job” and it triggered a lot of anxiety and agoraphobia again. I have gone outside and seen family and stuff. But everything is still difficult. 
So i’ve been in a bad spot since then. And now thoughts like “i wish i wasn’t born” and “i want to die” are daily thoughts now. i don’t have a plan on doing anything to myself or others. but it’s almost a constant buzz in the background. that i want to die. 
I know i do not want to die. i want all of these too hard emotions to cease. i want the grief to stop. i’m terrified all the time. and i feel like a burden to everyone in my life. 
I want to die, i don’t have a plan. But i genuinely wish i was not born. i’m tired, and it feels impossible to wait a couple more months to even go see my girlfriend.

Hey! I've been going through some tough times. And I have some mental issues. They're probably just fleeting thoughts, correct me If I'm wrong tho. So you know, growing up, i had quite a hard life. and even now it is still hard... I always see on the internet extremely unrealistic lifestyles (altough the pictures or whatever I see is in fact real) like young guys or girls my age becoming millionaires, dating Girls, having the lives of their dreams, and i kept comparing achievements and highlights like that on the internet (subconsiously i think), and people's lives to mine; and I'm gonna keep it short, my life is shit, if not worse. Although I'm close to finishing my masters degree, and most likely will succeed in doing so. i don't have anything else going for me, I never had a girlfriend, I'm touch starved, I'm affection starved, I have Depression swinging by me every now and then, but life keeps going, it just has to, doesn't it? I mean, in my country, Guns are illegal, drugs are illegal, so the suicide methods that are open are extremely painful, And this fact that i learned, that if one suicides, he will spend his entire afterlife in hell, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but most likely, correct me If I'm wrong. And most other methods of suicide are extremely painful. So, I keep thinking, why did god even create us, you know as humans? Are some humans, meant to suffer while others thrive? if god saw my future before i was born and knew that it had that much pain and suffering in it, why did he create me?? and probably thousands of other humans like me too?? I did not ask nor want to be created as a matter of fact, I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna exist. There's another thing, you know, girls in my country (Tunisia) are extremely conservative, and it is very hard to strike up a relationship, Like, Elden ring, Dark souls, type of hard, lol. So to cope obviously, i grew up jerking off to porn, then i switched to soft porn then i eventually went back, all this in the effort to remedy my mental or emotional trauma (which came from getting rejected by every single girl i try to talk to in my entire life) but i somehow turned out in the end to start hating women, like sometimes (not always) when i stumble upon a women online or irl, pure hate, anger, and envy start boiling inside of me and i want to do indespicable things to them. I suppose it is the result of the rejection trauma+me feeling like Guys are always on survival mode while girls are always on ""thriving"" mode+porn (maybe?)

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

If you feel offended by this, please don't take this text serisously. I am writing this text to seek help. Thank you.

1ma9sby,Would a respiradone overdose have long term/permenant neurological impacts on your mental health?,"Hey, so, around 4 years ago, I overdosed on respiradone. A very large amount of respiradone. I did it initially cause i was dumb af and thought it'd make me high in some way, I was already suffering mental health issues hence the prescription of respiradone..

Anyways, after taking the insane dose of respiradone, it essentially made my body want to sleep, constantly, and I couldn't sleep physically but my body constantly had the desire to sleep. I essentially became paralyzed unable to walk and my head on my shoulder at some point, barely comprehensible, slowed breathing, mental torture,  and about 24+ hours later after dealing with this, i eventually gave in and told my parents i overdosed and need to go to the hospital. I was taken to a hospital and it took them around 8-9 hours to give me some diazepam, which unparalyzed me, but mentally? I felt like the overdose I've never been the same since.

But at least, from what I remember, on that day before I overdosed, I enjoyed playing btd6, i enjoyed a lot of things. Games like that made me happy at the time. I never played btd6 again after the overdose, I lost enjoyment in everything. Everything pretty much numbed me. A complete feeling of emptiness, an incapability to feel enjoyment, or even sadness. From 16-18 life was pretty much torture, no feelings of happiness ever, not suicidal, just hopeless, no meaning or purpose in anything just complete emptiness.

And then I discovered alcohol when I turned 18, and for the first moment in years I was able to actually feel emotions, euphoria, sadness, anxiety, as if I was actually functional. I was able to play the games I used to enjoy, etc. I was an alcoholic ever since as it solved the issue of emptiness, and for about a year and a half I was a completely functioning alcoholic drinking 500ml-1.2l of vodka daily. 

And then I had acute pancreatitis as a result of alcoholism. And then i tried to maintain sobriety, I did for 10 days, and ended up failing as I couldn't bear it. I kept drinking till a second pancreatitis attack. And then I realized I seriously need to stop, and benzodiazipines have been the only real solution, not for a ""high"" but for the purpose of maintaining sobriety from alcohol.

I've been sober for the past 32 days now off of alcohol, and it'll remain that way, i use benzodiazipines now whenever i feel like terrible and they somewhat help, but i take tolerance breaks and try to use them as little as possible.

Just wondering generally if the  respiradone overdose in any way could have caused permenant neurological damages resulting in my current sober mental health being shit, completely empty and void of any possibility of happiness regardless of any efforts i make to try and make myself happy. Every day just feels like a chore with no fulfillment, i dont know if the od had anything to do with it  :(

1ma89ik,"Venting/Inability to do anything, things I need to do, things that I like or want to do","What is this? It’s gotten worse with age. I get in these states or moods where I can't do things I need to do, my responsibilities, chores, school, work, take care of my basic hygiene even. I have failed at university because of this, big time, dropped out 3 times, wasted so much student loan money, 50k in student debt with barely anything to show for it. Wasted all my money because I couldn't work, trying to buy things to make me feel good or to look good. I have my own personal debt on top of that. I lay in bed, not even sleeping sometimes, just lay there, ruminating, stuck in my past, hating myself. I can’t even do things I enjoy or what would make me feel good. Sometimes I have to wait these moods out until something really pushes me to shower, go to work, etc. Or I get a little ‘spark’. A part of me has a subconscious belief that I don't deserve happiness, to feel good. To experience good things. That I can't like what I like. I've had people in the past invalidate me a lot. Make me feel like I shouldn't like what I like or I do it for guys or I'm a poser and fake. I'm a girl so I think it’s partly sexism and misogyny. I've also experienced lucky things growing up and was made to feel like I'm ungrateful, spoiled, etc. That I shouldn't have had good things happen to me. It’s put a dark cloud over all those good things and good times in my life. Or when I try to be myself and love and accept myself, I'm called annoying, attention-seaking, narcissistic….I’m a shell of who I once was now. I've completely isolated myself. I don't want to negatively effect others because those close to me (Dad, brother) experience my unhappiness. It makes me irritable, judgmental, critical, bitter, angry, almost abusive, I physically and verbally lash out. I can't hurt more people. I've had people turn on me, people who I thought loved and cared for me stab me in the back or betray me. Friends, family. Been rejected, ghosted, discarded. Seen as not relationship material, I'm only good for sex. Or guys will try to make me the other woman. I feel like when people get to know me something about me is so hateable or unloveable or unlikeable. Or I'm super toxic. I hate myself. I haven't had relationships where I've felt loved and accepted for who I am. I have to be more agreeable to them to be loved. When I try to be myself, I'm turned on, invalidated, hated, made fun of. I can't dress or look the way I want to/express myself without calling attention to myself or be sexualized or fetishized. I can't help but hate myself now. I can't even accept love at this point. I want to die. I do work to fix myself but its so futile. I've done therapy, group therapy, dozens of stays in hospitals, various medication for adhd, depression, anxiety, bipolar, but nothing helps. I'm getting worse and worse. I think the only option is ending my life. There is no hope for me. I truly try to get my life together over and over and over again. Workout, eat good, take my meds, do therapy. I'm isolated from trauma with friends and family. I can't even truly connect with others now. I always fail, I always end up in these moods. I am not living a good quality of life, I am so incredibly unhappy. Its too exhausting to even fix myself because I know its so much work. Things have been really bad for like 3 almost 4 years.

I do very well at this job, it is natural for me. I am also taking college courses to get a degree in business management to further my potential in the company. But. What is the potential for. Another promotion? Another raise? For what? My rent that is always going up? My bills that will always be due? My taxes that will always be taken? It is crazy illogical to me. 

I am married to a woman for now 3 years who I've been with for 11 years. However she isn't there for me emotionally at all, and would rather be there emotionally for her parents who emotionally abuse her and take advantage of her or her ""friends"" that dont even invite her on trips(which always leaves her feeling left out in their friend group). I have no intentions of leaving her. Never will. Recently, she got pregnant, we've been trying for 2 years, so that's good. But. What am I bringing a kid into...? I don't even want to be here, how am I gonna convince a kid to stick around? How can I even be a good father when I'm having these incredibly dark thoughts about myself..?? I never have had legitimate thoughts of suicide until these past few weeks. It just seems so useless to keep fighting everyday for another day of the same. 

 I just am all over the place. I don't know what I'm fighting for anymore. I am excited to be a father. I just don't know how I can possibly do it while I can't even figure out my own motivation to get out of bed anymore. Lastly, to be clear, I have no one there for me. No one. I haven't for a long time, and the life I've created has only madecme lonelier. Oops. But, hindsight is 20/20 they say. Getting old sucks, don't do it. Thanks to all who read. Hope youre day is amazing. ",1753573230.0,2025-07-26 23:40:30+00:00,0,0,mentalhealth,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ma7qrp/sharing_to_destress_a_little/
