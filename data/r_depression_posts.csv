doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0,2362,177,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,2019-10-29 14:52:02+00:00
1jys8x9,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1744611968.0,44,113,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/,2025-04-14 06:26:08+00:00

1mcqqzs,"You’re still my husband, and I’m still your wife.","You hide the way you’re struggling because it’s easier to pretend everything’s fine than to show how broken you feel inside.

When panic hits, you shut down completely, no one knows how much you suffer alone, how you try to hold yourself together while the pressure from everyone around you crushes you.

You’re exhausted from fighting battles that no one sees, and I’ve been there, knowing all the pain you bury deep.

I know the way your people push when you’re at your weakest, not seeing how much it hurts ,telling you what to do, pulling you in every direction until you feel like you’re breaking apart just trying to please them.

I never wanted anything from you but to quiet that noise. To be the one place you could breathe without feeling like the world wanted a piece of you.

I know what it cost you to walk away, even if you pretend you’re fine now. I know you tell yourself, that you made the right choice, but I also know you how you force yourself to believe what others need you to believe, even when your heart says otherwise.

You once told me there was no reason to leave, and deep down, I know you still feel that. Don’t You?

People can push, they can scare, they can manipulate… but they can’t erase the truth. I loved your heart when no one else cared enough to understand it, and I carried every part of you, even the parts you thought were unlovable.

I wish that when your heart finds calm, you remember the love that stayed, even when you couldn’t.",1753831046.0,85,11,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcqqzs/youre_still_my_husband_and_im_still_your_wife/,2025-07-29 23:17:26+00:00

1md0t5z,I am beyond broken. So why do I keep enduring?,"[17f] So I've made it into a prestigious univeristy. I have inflicted so much pain towards myself, trying to be better, getting better.

The reason why I haven't thrown myself off rails was because I wanted to give a better life to my most special person, a life that I never had. Every night, I get panic attacks and I feel nauseous. It feels like there is fire on my skin. I am never breathing properly.

At only 9 years old, I began to have psychosis and CPTSD. There are memories I try to block away. Being doxxed online, being molested by an instructor, being raped and recorded, spat on and getting abused and hurt everyday, began drinking at 13, smoking,vaping, doing hard drugs at only 16 and burning myself with a lighter, now being on medication at 17 that makes me feel like a post-lobotomy woman. 

My mom and dad isn't by my side. I don't have ""daddy"" anymore, mom is rarely around and I can't stop crying while writing this, it makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed I amso ashamed and I don't have a single person in this world to lay down all my worries on. 

I never had an adult to give me wise words. I don't think I am smart, just hard working and retrying. Hurting and not knowing how to heal myself. Crying many hours in the restroom and then walking outside in professional character. Who am I supposed to be? Why am I not allowed to be angry? Why do I have to calm down? Why am I not allowed to hate the person that hurt me over and over and over? 

Don't tell me I am not alone, because I AM alone. I have had so much genuine empathy for those around me, despite all my emotions being numbed and having to fake every facial expression, because I have felt pain in my life before and I CARE. Recently, I have lost a lot of weight. I am not well. I am beyond broken, but no one understands my pain. I am not ready to be a parent. I am not ready to go far away. I am so so scared, so tired of everything. ",1753863003.0,9,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md0t5z/i_am_beyond_broken_so_why_do_i_keep_enduring/,2025-07-30 08:10:03+00:00

1md4q19,I wish I was never born,"I've tried. But I am tired. I am tired to wake up every single day, regretting that I did not die in my sleep. Regretting that I have to survive another day while I am already rotting inside. I guess that life doesn't love every person that exists. It would explain tragedies and accidents, and it would explain why some are happy while others suffer. Those lucky enough will be able to enjoy life, but those others will only continue limping towards their true peace.

I was afraid my whole life that I will die alone. That I will be trapped in my own mind with nobody to be there for me. And I guess that this is the only way my life will end no matter what I do. I know people would tell me to only care and think about myself. But I want to be understood too. I can't love myself. No matter how hard I have tried, I cannot bring myself to love me. It's impossible to accomplish when I am aware of the fact that nobody ever loved me either. And if nobody did, why would I? Maybe I am not worth loving. When everyone has the same oppinion on you, then maybe you truly are the problem. So why would you think different?

Though, it does hurt me. I have tried myself to be a good person. I know I wasn't the best, but I wasn't the worst either. I was just human. But for whatever reason, I wasn't treated like a human. Seen as a freak by everyone, abandoned when I was getting attached, isolated from the whole society. My whole existence did not matter to anyone. It was ignored, like a meaningless parasite of the world. How much I have tried to feel like I belong somewhere. Like I found a person that would notice that I am alive too. I didn't ask for love or best friends or a family of my own. Just one single person to notice my existence. To feel like I am alive here as well. But no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up alone in my own thoughts.

I guess that people are right. You can't save everyone. And maybe I wasn't even worth trying to be saved. To be shown that I am human as well. To feel like I am worth something. Like I can do something myself. Maybe in the end, those born as a nobody will forever remain that way. And there is no meaning in trying to change what fate has planned for them.",1753876941.0,4,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md4q19/i_wish_i_was_never_born/,2025-07-30 12:02:21+00:00
1mck2aw,Working a 9-5 is making me depressed…,"Ever since I graduated college 4-5 years ago I’ve been jumping from job to job . Every job was depressing to me and something not looking forward to

I was a case manager, teacher assistant, warehouse , and Macys. None of these jobs really excite me …(well Macys was fun as I was able to dress up everyday)…so I think I’m into creative endeavors 

I don’t understand why as human beings we have to suffer and work these mundane jobs until we die…it’s so depressing.

I feel I am different and would like to take an unconventional approach to life…

I thought about other career paths (creative/artistic ones) such as social media content creator, model, something in beauty industry (makeup artist, tattoo artist, nail tech) business owner, or even a professional nomad 😅….traveling in RV and off grid somewhere. I just want to be free….o feel trapped 

….but I keep thinking these jobs are not realistic , probably won’t pay much, don’t knowing how it would do in near future, I’m 25k debt from bachelors in speech therapy and I’ve never tried any of them 😂😅….so I don’t know if I’ll hate these paths to….as unfortunately work is work 🤷🏽‍♀️

1md2xba,No idea what to do from here,"It's now past 6am and I still can't sleep. I've had issues with insomnia my entire life, even going back to some of my earliest childhood memories. I'm at a work conference right now and have a long fucking day plus a flight ahead of me today and I'm like shaking because of the dread of having to get out of bed and face the day. I've struggled with depression, anxiety, really fucking bad ADHD and insomnia since I can remember. 

I just hate everything and everyone, but nothing and no one more than I hate myself. I can't ever let myself be happy anymore, I can't give myself credit for anything, I always feel like a complete fraud and I feel like I can't tell anyone just how deep and bad my depressions get and I'm just fucking tired of it all. Have been for years. I have a great family, a great devoted and loving wife, a great job paying $200k/yr, just bought a great new house...and I'm as unhappy as ever. I had testicular cancer 6 years ago and ever since haven't been able to produce testosterone. My urologist has more forcefully said I have to do something about it, but my wife is pushing hard for a baby, so we all agreed I can't just do TRT like he wants to, so he has me taking clomid which is making me even fucking crazier. We've been trying to have a kid to no avail and it's so difficult because I have no interest in sex, but I can't tell my wife that and just have to try my best to make it happen...and when I can't make it happen, I get so angry with myself. My primary care MD has tried all kinds of medications over the years but nothing has been successful...either I feel no difference at all or I feel worse. I'm always too cynical to take the advice of a mental health professional or self help method/book/whatever and feel like they're not really getting what I'm saying often times. All I come back to is what's the fucking point? Life sucks and I wish I could get off this ride.

I just turned 40 and I'm watching my parents becoming elderly and generally struggling all the time and I can't understand how they do it...I never used to have any anxiety around getting older, but now that I _am_ getting older, I dread it every goddamn day. I work with elderly people from time to time and I just see them physically and mentally falling apart more and more every day and I can't help but think to myself all the time ""is this _really_ all I have to look fucking forward to?!"" Their existence looks fucking miserable, they're constantly in pain, they're slowly degrading mentally, they're watching the world pass them by and their friends are dying left and right. My mom is pretty much just resigned to just sitting around and waiting for death herself at this point and it's breaking my dad and I feel like a terrible son because I hardly see them anymore because I've become so anti-social more and more every year and I know every day I'm losing and wasting the little time I have left with them.

My brain chemistry just absolutely will not allow me to find joy in anything anymore. I used to have a ton of friends, but now have very few anymore because I never want to do anything or be around anyone. The things I used to enjoy in life I get less and less joy out of all the time and the things I dread or dislike affect me more and more harshly all the time. I've had suicidal thoughts here and there since I was really young but at this point I desperately wish I could just kill myself and get this over with instead of working my ass off and just slowly wasting away in unhappiness until I get sick and suffer a long, drawn out, painful death or some shit. I don't believe in an afterlife or anything, I just wish I could not feel anymore; I wish there was just nothingness. I've seen myself slowly drag my wife down into a depression of her own and it absolutely fucking kills me and makes me hate myself more than anything I've ever done. I fantasize about being able to just disappear and no one (especially the ones I love) having any memory of me ever existing. I wish I could end it, but I could never do that to my wife and my family...and that makes me feel even more hopelessly trapped and even more depressed. 

I just won a sales award earlier this year at work and was sent on an all expenses paid vacation with my wife by my company and for a brief moment I actually gave myself credit for something. Days after we got home I finally broke down in pure emotion when I was alone and cried uncontrollably because I thought I was finally feeling deserving of something and feeling happy for myself. But ever since that moment, it's been right straight back down the slippery slope into my own hell. Every day feels monotonous and tedious and like I'm just getting by passing the time until my next full blown mental health crisis meltdown. I pretty much just drink and smoke myself into submission all the time anymore and most days it's literally the only thing I can do to knock myself out to go to sleep, otherwise I'm just up all night with racing thoughts and just stressing on every little thing. I'll just lay awake and worry about every little thing and/or have intrusive thoughts about every little thing I've fucked up in my life and/or every embarrassing moment in my life. I'm going to have to participate in sales workshops and will have to stand up and speak in front of a huge group of my own peers today and all I can think about is wishing I could go to the roof of the hotel and jump and end it.

1md2op0,Lack of support from spouse,"
Had a mental breakdown in 2019 that led to a hospitalization. I was diagnosed bipolar 2, major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. It cost me my job and I was able to find work again (I worked in a niche industry) but I struggled to hold down a job. You know how hard it is to even complete basic tasks when depression hits. Well, I got fired another 2 times. I was a really good salesman and I lost all confidence in my abilities. I became physically fearful (I guess anxiety) of facing the same customers I'd been dealing with for 20 years. I Left my job and the industry I'd worked in for 20 years and bought a business in a new industry.  It started odd well but I've watched it slowly shrink as I struggle to perform consistently. 

We have a daughter that I love and who loves me. I can't afford therapy and I use long and tedious government medical system to get medication. Therapy with them is a no go as you have to wait 3 months to speak to someone and they're so overwhelmed, they couldn't be bothered to care. It's difficult to say if the meds work because I haven't had a manic attack since I went on them but the depression is as bad as ever. 

My job allows me to get my daughter ready for school and to fetch her after. I know how hard it is for my wife with me struggling and I try to help at home but some days I just can't manage to do anything. 

I love my wife and I see what this is doing to her. It's been 6 years of this with no end in sight. She's a strong person but she can only be strong for so long before she too starts cracking. Well, that already happened - I feel like she resents me. We're not connected any more. We haven't even been intimate in a year. When things get too much for her, she'll snap and we'll fight. I've given up trying to explain that I'm struggling because she thinks it's just some sort of excuse. 

I thought about ending things in 2021 and scared myself into a 72 hour suicide hold at the psych ward because of how calm and retionally I was planning it. What worries me is I'm having those thoughts again. I just know that the only thing keeping me alive is the financial impact it will have on my family. I haven't even got any life cover and (during mania in 2019) I racked up massive debt that I still haven't cleared. That will fall on my wife and daughter. But it hurts so much because I feel they'd be better off if I wasn't here. 

I'm not sure why I wrote this post. Probably because I don't have anyone I can talk to. This is my first post. Man, I don't know anymore ",1753870204.0,4,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md2op0/lack_of_support_from_spouse/,2025-07-30 10:10:04+00:00
1md5ojn,I want to leave but I'm a coward,"I have just turned 18 years old, two days later my dad died, and it was something very traumatic for me because I felt it practically like suicide, I feel shit for not being able to help him, for not being able to save him, everyone tells me that it was not my fault, that he had wanted to leave for a long time but nevertheless I cannot help but feel guilty, he died in a very tragic way and that hurts me with my soul, I feel broken because months before he left he told me crying that he felt that I did not love him, I never showed him my love towards him, I have always been very closed in that aspect, I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me with several girls two days after my father's death, I relapsed again into drugs (thank God I was able to stop using because I felt that it only made me more depressed) I don't have friends, I don't study, I don't work, I don't feel like it, I simply want to stop existing, I don't go out and I have to sleep in the same house as my abuser (my stepfather who abused me from the age of 7 to 13) and even to this day he continues to hint at me, but what can I do? I already ran away from home at 15 for a year and it was worse for me, my mom prefers her husband over me:) I have never been able to feel wanted or loved by anyone because they always end up hurting me, even my own mother who claims to love me doesn't, she doesn't suffer abuse or anything like that from her partner and still defends her, once I tried to talk about the abuse and I made things up, leaving me feeling very bad.

I completed the program, but couldn’t land an entry level job. After years of trying, I’ve mostly given up on that path. I still code for fun and enjoy it, but it doesn’t pay the bills.

1md0ikb,I want to die. Literally just wanna shoot my brains out.,"Life is hard. For everyone I know. But they are able to go through it, it seems. And it just seems so unbearable for me. Really, I'm even ashamed of complaining now. An exhausted failure by design. But what else do I do? It just feels like I wanna scream and scream and die out of exhaustion.

I don’t wanna tell much about my personal life, but my parents are great. They did and still do so much for me. And I'm here like a cripple. 

Money, money, money.... I cannot seem to solve this problem. There's this need in me to be independent in a way that I never depend on anyone ever. Doing that feels like being a failure and a cripple. But I'm dependent and I don't see a way out of this. I wanna be autonomous.

The world demands so much even for you to worth anything in all aspects– money to relationships to the freedom to just live as you want. And I get it. But it feels so unfair to be born and thrown into this shit where you have no choice but to go through this.

I'm from a shitty place. And I always wanted to move from here. But now it just feels so out of reach. I'm twenty five. I sometimes try to be hopeful and think I'll figure something out, but then I look at my life....

Nothing really matters in the big picture ofcourse. I'm just 1 in 8 billion, dead or alive, happy or sad, living or surviving. So many people are dying being forgotten, going through unimaginably worse shit than me, nothing changes. People come, people do. The world runs the same. I don't even know why I write this stuff. I write poetry and shit that no one could care less about. Which is fair to be honest. 

But for now, living the way you, whatever you are, want if you're alive feels like it does matter, or else life doesn't seem to worth or mean anything.

BE EXCEPTIONAL OR ADAPT seems to be the slogan of the world. And I'm neither one of those. ",1753861821.0,5,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md0ikb/i_want_to_die_literally_just_wanna_shoot_my/,2025-07-30 07:50:21+00:00

I made a drastic decision to move across the country. 1500mi, I drove alone to my destination. I had been fantasizing about jumping off a bridge into the Mississippi River, in the city I had barely ever left. A place I felt trapped. I left so I wouldn’t have to put my mother through something like that again. 

And I’m here now. Heavily in debt, jobs falling through, and my mental health spiraling ever downward again. I was okay, for only a little while. I met someone who made me really feel like a person, for the first time in awhile. Now I feel like a burden to them, to my roommate, my family.. myself, once again.

1mcs21o,I will always be autistic and I cannot cope with it,"I think deep down I always thought I could overcome my autism. I was intelligent enough, mature enough, empathetic enough, in tune with my emotions “enough”. Talking to more people has me realizing that truly, it is hopeless. I am so far behind everyone else it’s almost funny that I ever thought I had a chance to be a likable, outgoing person. I’m not smart, funny, empathetic or verbally fluent. I’m also not attractive or confident. It’s very possible I will never be any of those things at all. 

My awkwardness has barely improved with practice, and even worse is that I’m genuinely not curious at all about other people. It’s hard enough for me to imagine someone being interested in what I think that I usually don’t even try to converse with people who don’t show immediate interest. I’m left with people who pursue me, who either have no other options because everyone else rejected them, relate to me because of our mutual emotional stuntedness(awesome), or weird, transient status seekers. Usually there’s a reason they’re talking to me and not someone else. But honestly, I’m usually happy anyone is talking to me at all. I thought, maybe if I read more books, or watched more comedy, or degraded myself in “therapy” I would finally feel normal, and likable. No, I was just born like this, unchanging and repellant.

1md2hz4,Antidepressant Experience with Citalopram,"After moving around for the last few years, I've finally been able to have regular contact with a psychologist, and they have prescribed me the antidepressant citalopram (20mg).

I'm on my second week, and so far, I don't feel a notable difference apart from some strange (but amusing) dreams and a slight improvement in my focus and appetite. I was told that it would take 4-6 weeks to really take effect, so I'm assuming this is normal for this stage.

Unless there's a dramatic difference between my current state and the post-6-week stage, I might ask them to increase the dosage or try another drug. I know this works via the SSRI route, and I like the *idea* of having more serotonin in circulation because I tried ecstasy once and it was genuinely one of the best experiences of my life. So, if I can get close to having that feeling on a daily basis (obviously not to the same degree), then I think it would improve things.

Life feels meaningless lately, just the hope that I‘ll someday find meaning in it again keeps me somewhat going. Life feels so meaningless and all I feel is grief for the things long gone and two loved ones that passed away and all else I feel is anxiety of the future with all the political turmoil and uncertainty. And I feel beyond miserable and I cry and cry and sometimes even silently scream and oh do I want to really scream out loud but I can’t - I always somewhat hold my pain back. And I don’t feel truly seen in this. People probably think I‘m just „moderately depressed“ just like I always am and since I‘ve been managing it all for so long (again, 10 years) they probably thing I‘ll always manage it.
It feels so overwhelming, I‘m laying in bed right now, having cried again and again not even certainly knowing if I‘m suicidal or not. I know that for me it’s not that I truly want to die, as for many suicidal people, we just don’t want this pain anymore. But how fucking long do I have to wait till I can finally say I‘m happy?? Some in between moments are okay and yes I laugh and have fun with friends occasionally, does it mean I‘m not as depressed?? Isn’t high functioning depression a thing? Didn’t Kurt Cobain also occasionally have fun? 
I feel irritated lately and angry and I rarely felt that in the past years but I am so sick of always having to hold it together. I‘m so sick and tired of waiting for people to see me, to truly see my pain and to comfort me and to just be truly present. 
I‘m trying to rationally think about reasons to stay alive and to want and stay alive. There sure are many reasons; such as my pet, my friends, my family, the chance that maybe I could make a career of what I love, the chance to help animals and people. I can rationally tell myself „hey maybe it will get better and you’ll be glad you stayed alive“. 
But emotionally it all doesn’t hold as much power right now. 
So please, if anyone here that’s been feeling like this and has truly come out of this knows just what to say then I would appreciate it. I don’t want to get to the point where I truly don’t care anymore if I take my life or not. Right now I do still have maybe 2% of fighting in me, I can’t lose that.

1mctint,I feel like my life has no purpose or direction,"I am a mess. I am a 33-year-old female who lives at home with family. I also earn $13 an hour working at a tech support call center full time, and I HATE it. I am dissatisfied with my job, as well as my life itself. Oh, I also have high-functioning Autism, as well as depression, anxiety, and OCD, if that helps. I don’t drive (I have never gotten a learner’s permit, even). 

I can’t seem to find what makes me tick. I do know that I have writing as a strength, and I have been told by a family member that my writing is good. I also know that I am organized. 

My mom just disparaged me about my “sitting on my ass and doing nothing while I am not working.” Why would I want to be productive ALL THE TIME while I am not at work? She seems to think that always working, working, working is the solution to life’s problems. My late grandmother (her mother) once said that my mother has “nervous energy.” 

I often imagine what my life would be like if I had just been more assertive with how I could make something of myself, starting in high school. I think the main reason why I had less freedom in choosing my classes back then was because I was in special education. I am so angry at myself because I was in special education back then (because of my autism). I probably would have taken the AP classes I wanted to take (as well as other high-level classes), and I would have double majored in computer science and Chinese. I would have a high-paying tech career, have the technical and creative hobbies I would want, and I would volunteer often, too. 

But, here I am. I know it is all my fault that I don’t have the life I want, but I am still unhappy. Since I am 33 years old, I feel like I am too old to start from scratch. 

I am going back to school starting early next year. I already have an associate’s degree in a foreign language, and I am going back for my bachelor’s then. 

I just started this rude awakening. I’m 33 (like I previously stated), and I feel like that, for most of my life, I have been in a slumber. That just changed. I want a life of freedom. A life where I could live on my own terms. 

Please don’t be mean to me about this. If you don’t have anything nice (or at least constructive) to say about this, don’t bother commenting.

1md6cno,I keep on being ignored and I now isolate myself from everyone,"I'm a teen that started self harm just a couple months prior when the schools were still open. In just the first month, it had affected me a lot and i was feeling really down. So I confessed to my supposed ""friends"". 2 of them exactly. They were both my classmates (our class is small, only 6 people) so i thought we were close enough despite not talking outside school. Though, I've always though they don't like me as much as i like them. But one night, I really built my courage up and texted them both, saying that I self harm. They both gave me short messages that really hurt me. I honestly don't know what I expected, but it surely wasn't this. I should've never even told them. I was feeling left out in the class anyways, because I'm the only boy and they sometimes joke about me going away and the class being only females. I really hate it.

Anyways, a couple months into my self harm, at around may, i met a girl from another class in the school. She came to our class from time to time because her friend was there. We rarely talked but when we did, I couldn't forget it for weeks. We had a lot in common and eventually, we started texting on instagram. We talked almost every day and talked about everything, even our vulnerabilities. So about a month in, I told her too. I regret it to this day. I know I shouldn't have, but I had to get it off my chest somehow. Slowly, we began talking less and less. Despite telling her some time after that I feel suicidal, she didn't seem to care too much. We have completely stopped talking now.

Before I told all 3 though, I actually got caught by my parents. There were lots of knife cuts on my wrist. Precise, clean and collected in one place. I said a cat did it, and they didn't ask any more questions. They didn't seem to give a fuck too.

When I was at school, I was acting really suspicious and constantly hiding my wrist from the teachers when I wore t-shirts. They realized i was acting weird, but they didn't say anything because I almost always wear a jacket and they probably thought i was cold and that was the reason.

No one asks me how I feel or how I'm doing anymore, and I'm tired of trusting people to help me when the people I was most vulnerable to completely disregarded me and ignored me.

I don't think I can get over this, and I'm not sure I can trust anyone anymore. I feel worthless.

1mcydqh,no matter how far ahead I get depression seems to catch up,"I deleted reddit for 3 days because the negativity was getting to me. I instead switched to focusing on the positives in my life. I showered and brushed my teeth, which was a good step. I reached 11 weeks clean from self harm. I finished Breaking Bad (my favorite show ever). I even deleted all my depression playlists and replaced them with a playlist titled ""it will get better"".

so why doesn't it feel real?

you know, I was feeling completely normal just a few moments ago. but then, it's like it all dropped at me at once. And now tears are falling from me face, and I don't know why.

I don't want to slip backwards. I'm making progress, aren't I? I can get better, can't I? Right??

Or am I just distracting myself? Bottling up my emotions, like I used to do all the time?

until I accidentally get too close to the edge.

and I fall, feeling the depths of sadness starting to envelope me again.

I need to stop it.

but how?

that's the thing.

my depression is a part of my brain. there is no getting rid of it. there is no escaping it. there is no fixing it.

there's just running from it while hoping I don't trip.

I had all the resources I needed in order to succeed, yet I took advantage of none of them, failing a lot of my classes through the years. I'm 17 now, birthday was on the 28th. I'm an incompetent idiot, it's amazing that i can live like this and not feel ashamed. 17 years of living, all squandered away on who knows what, it's impressive that i've lived that long and not done anything remotely remarkable. At my core, im just a somehow loved waste of money, time, and energy; though i feel i deserve nothing from hatred from my parents. I would ask for a counselor, but its a far stretch for me to think i can ask for anything at all.

1md4wxc,future-talk with my dad,"little rant. my dad wanted to talk to me about my upcoming plans and goals and i was excited to talk to him because I've been managing to deal with my manic depression a whole lot better lately. well, the conversation ended with me sobbing and now i'm quite literally done for the rest of the day.

last year i couldn't even go down the street because i was at such a low point i couldn't even leave the house without having a full on panic attack. it's been a little more than a year, and though it's been very difficult, it's looking better currently. the problem is that he doesn't see that at all. for him, a normal 21 y/o has a steady job with great income and an apartment that they rent. but as someone who deals with so many different things because of a million mental illnesses, I'm doing the best I can and I think i'm doing great currently.. it just doesn't seem to be enough. it makes me feel horrible that they expect so much but I can only give so little in their eyes.

i currently manage to work a minijob, travel 2-3 times a week to see friends that live a few hours away and i've been creating a lot of things because I'm finally feeling creative after a long time of just lying in bed. and that's barely anything to him.

for him, that's not even the bare minimum, it's nothing. for him, I'm being lazy and he literally said he thinks i don't work a 9-5 because then I don't have that free time anymore. meanwhile my 'free time' was just me crying all day and trying to at least leave the bed for just a few hours a day. now i travel because i noticed it helps me feel better and i draw a lot + arts & crafts when I'm not at work, but apparently he wants me to spent 90% of my life at work to make money.

the whole conversation was about money. and I get that it's very important! especially because the world isn't getting cheaper. but! i make my own money with my minijob which is enough because I luckily still live with them. not even once did he say he was proud of what I've accomplished or happy that I'm still alive after last year, the whole time it was about money, money and money.

i feel like shit now. i thought i was doing good but apparently I'm still a disappointment. he said he didn't notice any change from last year.

I'm literally a whole different person from last year and I'm doing SO much better.

but well, that doesn't matter. because i should be making more money, right? that's more important i guess. i hate how they will always see me as a mentally healthy person who's just lazy instead of a mentally ill person who's doing their best and trying to navigate their life as best as they can.",1753877507.0,1,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md4wxc/futuretalk_with_my_dad/,2025-07-30 12:11:47+00:00

But that desire exists only because so much of life is a lie. Things don’t always sort themselves out, there really is no happy ending for normal people, there’s no silver lining behind the pain you feel, it’s having a mind that begs for attention but only in isolation. Really it’s like a reverse narcissism where everything that you think is programmed to somehow make you the villain in your head, putting yourself in the center of it. And then you hate yourself more for doing that. It’s like a snake eating itself and growing back at the same time. Love isn’t love it’s compromise.

Everything I think is in the title. I'm a 24M virgin, partly by choice because I didn’t want to be with a girl I didn’t truly love, also by circumstances, because I couldn’t anyways since I had health problems for a very long time.

Today life is better. Health is way better, have a cool job, started to go to the gym. Recently wanted to start to date. But I realized that most of the women of my age already had at least relationship. That's not a bad thing, women are allowed to be with as many people as they want, but as I continued to date I started to question myself.

What’s the point ? I want to love someone deeply, very, very truly. But the average women of my age has so much more experience than me. I wont ever be her first one, that one guy, I will never be as special as her as she is to me. That’s not an accusation, It’s stupid to judge people based on their previous relationships. But that’s a fact. If I was gay I would say the same about men.

It broke something in me. I will never be able to live what I wanted to live so deeply, to experience something so special with someone else. I know you can love someone very intensely the second time, but that’s not the same sparkle anymore in my opinion.

Honestly and I feel very surprised and ashamed of myself, but since that realisation a few months ago, it feels like everything is pointless. I stopped doing things, lost my drive. I will never be able to understand what so much people lived.

1md49e4,I just don’t know anymore,"Thought I’d give going on a rant on reddit a shot.

I don’t even know where to begin to be honest. I guess I can just start with the most obvious, I have severe depression (who could’ve guessed). I’ve had severe depression for as long as I can remember, which isn’t saying much because I also have a dissociative disorder, which in turn makes my memory that of a goldfish’s and causes me to lose my fucking mind.

I guess it all started when I was young, like single digits, and I was sexually abused by a family member. As I grew up, I started to realise what had happened and I think that’s when I became depressed, honestly I’ve been like this for so long that it just feels like I was born wanting to end it all. 

I’ve had multiple attempts to leave this life, all 10 have clearly failed. I have been contemplating whether I should try again or not, but even kms just sounds tedious at this point. I don’t have the motivation to do anything, I don’t have any dreams or aspirations. The meds aren’t helping anymore, the distractions aren’t distracting. The voices in my head are getting louder and more obnoxious, the psychologist appointments are getting annoying. 

I just want to escape this life, go to a different world or something. Although at this point I don’t even know if that would change anything.

On second thought, I think it’d be nice to just sleep forever, don’t have to worry about anything then. Fuck I’m tired.",1753875545.0,2,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md49e4/i_just_dont_know_anymore/,2025-07-30 11:39:05+00:00

1md42fx,"Unable to understand myself. Feeling stuck and lost in life, in love, in confidence, in everything","
Idk what I going on with my mind. It keeps getting harder each day, negetive thoughts keep getting more and more. Idk why am I scared for myself and unable to do anything. Lost the girl I fell I love with that affected me so much along with everything else. I haven't been able to work for last 4-5 years. Had been in severe depression post covid and thought I lost everything my life and gave up all hopes. Was just passing my time. Then I started to get a little better atleast mentally. But I wasn't earning anything. I wanted to do something but I couldn't. Would alway think negatively as soon as something I should be doing. Idk why has my thoughts become like this. And then I distract myself with other things a movie or something else something random. I know I was smarter before and now I feel like my brain has become slower as well. While I want to earn respect for myself and money for myself, Idk why I am unable to do it I keep wasting time even when I know I shouldn't and it's eating me up from inside 24x7. I feel useless and scared all the time. People say start small do something small and I know they are right but I don't how to explain how hard it has become to do something small as well. I don't know what to do. As if in my mind I know I should be running towards working for something for myself but I feel my body is chained down and it hurts a lot. It's really hard to explain this. As if I have min stop brain fog. I feel like I want to escape from this world. Run away somewhere else. but at the same time somewhere I also want to fight for myself. I know this is contradictory but my feelings and thoughts have been jumping up and down for such a long time. Even for small decisions of day to day life to big decisions. Even deciding to watch something I would feel I want to watch an episode or something and in the middle of it I would feel heavy thinking what the hell am I doing with myself watching this shit and wasting my time.

1mcy566,I just wanna be with my family again,"Hi, I don't really know how to start this off but for context I am sixteen years old and a month after I turned 15 I had to move out. My older sisters and grandma's decided that it would be better for me and my other sister to go stay at my grandmas for a while because things weren't going well at home. My grandma owns an apartment building sort of so they set up one of the rooms for me and my sister to stay in. It was only supposed to be for a week so that my parents could maybe fix things, but it's been well over a year now. Things have always been rough at home but in the past few years it had really started getting bad to the point it was effecting our health not only mentally but physically. My parents constantly fought both verbally and sometimes physically, and our house was not suitable to live in. It still isn't.
Living at my grandmas has helped me be alot healthier and taken me out of my depression for the most part. It was hard at first and some days it gets bad but it was alot better than what it was like living there. Recently though, it hasn't been very good. My sister just graduated highschool and she has moved to another state with her bf. I am very happy for her and I am really excited that she gets to finally get out. But now I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm all alone. I know I have a lot of people in my life that love and support me but it's not the same as having someone that's really with you and sees what's going on. Siblings moving out is hard for everyone especially the youngest kids, I know that but now I'm completely alone. I just wanna live with my family again. Even if I could just live with my dad I think it'd be better. While my sister was here I still had feelings of loneliness but she was there to help me. 
I don't know if maybe I'm just dramatic because I know people have it a lot worse but I wish I could have a happy family in a clean nice home. But I know I can't have that. It just hurts when I get up in the morning to an empty home and when there's no one to ask me how my day was when I get home from school or work. Or when I have to make myself dinner even if I'm really tired. A few weeks ago I had a dream that I was back home with my family and I was younger and it felt so happy. When I woke up I was really excited but once I realized where I was I just felt hopeless. I couldn't get out of bed except to go to the bathroom. It used to be when I felt like this or I couldn't sleep at night because of it, I would go sleep in my sisters bed and cry in her arms. But now I can't and I can't call her because it's not the same and I don't want her to worry. 
My dad wants me to live with him again and I really want to also but the house is even worse then when we left and because of the mold and bugs and mice I can't go back there. My mom lives with her friend and I can sleep over there somtimes but its not the same. I just wish I could have my own room in a house with my family and my dogs and I wish it could be clean and I wish I didn't have to feel scared. 
I have always had trouble sleeping because I jsut can't stop thinking and once I do sleep I have nightmares. I know that I'm sixteen and I shouldn't cry about nightmares anymore but it scares me. And because I live alone now when I wake up I still don't feel safe. 
I don't know I just wanna feel loved again. ",1753852909.0,3,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcy566/i_just_wanna_be_with_my_family_again/,2025-07-30 05:21:49+00:00
1md3w01,I feel abandoned amd numb,"Sorry if this is too long. My entire life has been full of struggles, I have never gotten the things that I wanted. 6 years ago I started a fresh career without any prior training or study, consider myself to be naturally good at it. No matter the talent, I haven't been able to get to a good position even after working professionally for 5 years. It's not because I'm dumb or lazy, but just because I never got a good opportunity and felt that some power is working against me, plus the last 3 companies that I worked at all closed down. So last year I decide to do a masters abroad and away from my home, I took a huge loan and started my studies hoping that things would look better, everyone in the class told me how good I was, both as a person and a professional. Forward to April, my girlfriend back home broke up with me, while I was grieving for that and applying for internships for graduating I got 3 offers and all of them retracted because of the visa process.

So now while almost everyone in the class with my experience similar to me has got an internship, I am stuck here with no hope of getting one, failed relationship, and in a huge debt.
I feel like a failure, all this potential and just because of streak of bad lucks I'm here directionless and numb, don't have a clue what to do and why this is happening to me.

I used to be a spiritual person, but for the past couple weeks I have a heart sinking feeling of being forsaken by the higher power.

I used to be very strong and would never think of ending it and would always believe that there is a way out but not anymore, I'm completely clueless, directionless, and numb to a point where I just wish that I don't wake up in the morning.
Everyone around me loves me but I cannot bear this weight of being a failure in life at 30 years of age. It feels something is working against me and no matter what path I take it will always lead to failure and don't want to face any more of it please!!",1753874343.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md3w01/i_feel_abandoned_amd_numb/,2025-07-30 11:19:03+00:00
1mcy3o7,Losing All Hope,"I've been silently struggling for the most part of my life. Didn't have a proper school life due to my avoidance caused by speech blocks and also bullying by the teachers. 

I didn't have the usual timeline followed by the majority of people, school to college to career then marriage, family etc. I spent a lot of time doing things on my own, trying to do courses online and I have so many certificates. Due to financial issues, I got my degree at a later age. I was losing confidence because of a lack of a degree but now that I have it and I have done well in it, I feel even more low because that alone isn't enough. Those around me are having Masters, PhD and so on. I don't feel enough.

Firstly, I wanted a degree to get back my confidence. I don't believe in doing things to show the world. Of course, I'd be happy to flaunt my credentials, but that's not my primary goal. I wanted to regain control over my thoughts on my own self. I wanted to see myself in a better way. I hate it when people do things to fit in with the society.

Now, I'm unable to land myself any jobs. It's either far from my place or they want me to do max for low pay. This is affecting my confidence level and I've started to feel anxious and I'm experiencing speech blocks more than usual. I feel like crying as I'm typing this. 

Just had an argument with my partner about my degree. My primary goal was get a degree to feel better about myself and also use that to get more career opportunities. My partner is like, you don't get degrees to keep them to yourself, you have to do a degree that's worth obtaining, I can't even wrap my head around what we argued on, my mind is too full of sadness and frustration.

I'm trying but nothing's working. I do have plans to get a higher degree once I start earning more steadily and I know the field too, but with my current state of mind and the blocks, being a teacher isn't easy. I'm unable to say my name at times, I'm unable to say certain words, teachers are expected to take charge of matters, but I'm more of a backstage worker, I don't like the spotlight, but I enjoy teaching, but that's also getting me anxious. I can't always be anticipating things and be nervous. Those who see me feel that I have a perfect life, perfect personality. I'm unable to be myself due to my blocks.

Now the degree that I have, I'm left to compare it with others, feeling inadequate. I put my heart and soul into getting this degree and I'm proud of the path I've taken after what I've experienced in life, but without money, a career that pays you that money, nobody would respect you. Where there's money, there goes the respect and admiration.

I had the skills but everybody who wanted to hire me wanted a degree, now that I have it after putting in so much of effort, now I'm made to feel that it's not enough, you need to do more or gain more credentials, Masters. I'm yet to earn the money that was spent on my first degree, I need to have some savings and then proceed to do the next degree, but I feel that nothing's enough. My achievements are nothing. I feel inadequate. Those without any credentials are teaching, conducting classes, and I'm struggling in life. I'm always having second thoughts about my own potentials.

I wish I just disappeared or never existed. Why does life have to be different for me over the years and difficult even after these many years? I'm exhausted. I feel stagnant. I envy those in other fields who are easily (I mean skills and degrees that helps them land jobs) able to earn, buy houses, pay bills, travel around, in short, have a stable career. I have been doing what I'm great at, with no savings, no career placements, no career progress, nothing.

I can sing, dance, write, design modules, plan lessons, teach with a passion, but stuck in many ways. I feel frustrated and I'm losing hope.",1753852765.0,3,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcy3o7/losing_all_hope/,2025-07-30 05:19:25+00:00

1md3abu,Why is my life a never ending cycle of losing,"For context: I was in a Uni in the UK on an international scholarship and I’m from a different country. 

Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make sure I hadn't died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. I was stuck in a stuffy room with not much sunlight or privacy just alone with myself, with a psyche which slowly crumbled. The new medicine made me unlike myself. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by scraping my arms and legs with scissors, keys and forks. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn’t come willingly they would’ve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Lucy (19F) let’s say. After staying in the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She has BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk (I never drink) as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn’t move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she’s sorry. I was blind thought she was sweet and amazing, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she’s been in too long and she decides to stay with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Lucy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she’s basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn’t ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I’m not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I’m sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when I reach the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn’t take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency room. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn’t be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I’m practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I’m given. The next day I’m made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Lucy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions. But while this was happening, Lucy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on the street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn’t rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Lucy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hang out together and love each other. I help her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feelings better. But then two nights before I left, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn’t drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drank too much and I’m feeling sick. Wendy, in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while, thinks she hurt me and tries to kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. I'm still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puking but I try my best to remind her it’s all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately got my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Lucy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she’s okay. I black out in my bed thinking she’s dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won’t do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to my home country he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I’m shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go by and I keep in regular contact with Lucy and a friend: Eric (40M). Lucy is staying with Eric temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I’m just unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Lucy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty thing and making me feel fucking awful. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Eric drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I’m a horrible person and that it’s my fault this is happening to her. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I’m in the hotel. The whole thing with Lucy messed Eric up and he tried to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combating trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I was made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which padding and chains to the wall. It was so fucking scary.. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me to the hospital but he was getting mad that we had to wait even though it’s normal. So he burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor rudely then left. After my appointment, he was screaming about how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum while I’m physically aging my head in front of him because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn’t gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it’s like I’m thirsty in a desert and there’s a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It’s like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I’d be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn’t choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I’d lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my younger brother could lose stability, I’d force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers’ future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn’t do it even if I may kill myself. My younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can’t. I'd take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self a lot of days. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad.

Obviously there’s a lot more detail but this is what has happened. Right now I’ve been on new medicine and I’m more my normal self after that period of being on that bad medication.

I keep thinking bad thoughts. Like ending it. That I’ve got future. That I’m stupid and ugly and useless. That I will be nothing. I have such intense self hatred I want to kill it by killing me. I just want to be loved, is that so hard?? So somebody can prove to me that I am worth something more than fuck all. I know it’s unhealthy, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know at all. Fuck me. This is the third time and most intense time. I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 14 managed to bring myself back from the edge and improve only to go through hell at 17 in a college course that made people actively want to kill themselves, only to somehow work hard through it while being nearly homeless for a time, financially, emotionally absurd, and lack of food, to this. I work so damn hard. Why the fuck does this keep happening to me. I know I’m not special so how the fuck does this happen. 

I’m sorry. I’m exhausted. I’m thinking bad things. It’s nearly 2am for me. I was thinking of Lucy. I missed feeling like I was worth something even if it was from somebody as toxic as her. Now I doom scroll dating subreddits to fill a hole I know can’t be filled by another person. But I keep thinking so anyways. I’m tired of living. I’ve seen enough and time and time again I get beat down. My whole life. What do you think that teaches me? That no matter what I do, all my hardwork will amount to nothing, that all my actions are meaningless because it’ll end this way and there’s no point living. Help me. I don’t know how to help myself. Why can’t I love me. That’s all I want. I want to cry. But the meds keep me from doing so. I want to fucking die so bad

Thank you for reading if you did. It’s long and messy. Fucked up and violent. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 

I don’t know what to say. I’m going to bed now. Good Night you all.
I hope you have good days.

1md33nz,September 1st,"I’m 34 and over the last 20 or so years, I’ve gotten more depressed each day. I ruined my life and I finally reached the point that I knew was inevitable. To put it mildly, I don’t understand people. The only thing I ever wanted in life was a family of my own and it hurts so bad to know I failed and will never figure it out. Some might say “it’s never too late” or something along those lines, I would say that to someone else, but it’s not true. I live alone, have no friends, no kids, no pets, no nothing and have made zero progress towards changing any of that for 20 years. I’ve been such a pathetic failure for so long that even if I believed it was possible for things to change, there’s not enough time. After September 1st, I will  have enough money saved that that on top my life insurance will cover any debts. It’s such a strange feeling. It’s calming in a way.

1mcnjnk,I’m losing my will to live,"I (23f) have been diagnosed with and struggling with major depressive disorder severe and recurrent since i was 13-14. 
i have an amazing boyfriend and two cats that i love dearly, and i live with them in a cheap and honestly poor quality apartment. im on my third job in two years, on and off of employment. i cant seem to stay employed very long before needing to take a mental break, which is beyond exhausting, but also has been affecting me financially, which just adds so much more on top of that. having to use a credit card for necessities feels so defeating. Just, everything I do is exhausting. I have been exhausted for years. I get no relief from anything. Eating feels like a chore, hygiene feels like a chore, playing games/watching tv/phone time brings me nothing anymore, i have one single friend that i text occasionally, i feel no motivation to reach out to anyone anymore. i feel like an empty and hollow shell of a person and i dont know how im supposed to go on living like this. nothing feels like its worth the exhaustion that accompanies it. i’ve pretty much had in my head that “i wont live very long” for several years now, and every day it feels like im getting closer to my end. everything i do just feels so futile. i have been carrying this agony that is so heavy, so ancient, for so long, and i know eventually i will need to drop it. i dont really want to die, i just dont know what other options i have. i cant imagine anyone living like this for the rest of their lives. my boyfriend is pretty emotionally constipated, but i dont expect him to fix me, anyways. since i cant work a full 40hr week due to my depression, i dont bring in a lot of money, and i cant afford regular therapy sessions. im on medications, and they do alleviate some of my symptoms, but its just so beyond overwhelming at this point. i just want to feel some kind of genuine relief from this deep rooted pain. i dont know what im supposed to do anymore.

1md321w,Who is it even for..?,"First, I just want to preface by saying the bulk of this will be to do with alcohol, but also depression too. Our tyrannical UK government made it essential to post digital ID, so I can't even access the alcohol-related subs for help, despite being 23

Im currently 84 days sober, coming out of drinking 120 units on avg a week, so fairly heavy. I would spend the time from noon onwards getting messed up, so that I wouldn't need to think. Unemployed, no relationship, still at home etc. Through my faith (Christianity), I was able to whittle it down and quit. I thought that the alcohol was standing in my way, preventing me from finding a girlfriend getting a career in the field I choose for university. 

But no, fucking no. Im still in the same position. For the last few years Ive done everything to try to be more desirable datingwise (workout regularly, skincare, work on confidence, have a range of interests, work on my faith) and careerwise (obtained clinical experience, worked on CV applied to places). Who the fuck am I even doing this for anymore? A non-existent gf? My father who's soon going to pass away with cancer? Im clearly not doing it for myself, because I would be fine working a job at Tesco and get by through the bare minimum.

So why shouldnt I just go back to drinking? Whats stopping me other then the small ounce of pride I have in having quit for 84 days. Because my life wont change for the worse, and it sure fucking helps me cope with existing. I developed alcoholism because of my depression, not the other way round.

And then lastly, how fucking dare the UK government do this. For all those seeking help, and probably have it worse then me.. ",1753871547.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md321w/who_is_it_even_for/,2025-07-30 10:32:27+00:00
1mcz4os,I'm fine but I still don't want to live,"I was diagnosed with major depresive  disorder last year. I do talk to a therapist and take meds. But other than that I don't really talk about in general or the fact that I still feel like I don't wanna live. I'm not actively suicidal, and I don't really plan to kill myself but I just don't like living. Everything is fine and my life generally speaking is not bad. So I don't know why I still feel this way. I wanna talk to someone who isn't my therapist about how I actually feel. I go to work and school, I try cause I know that's what is expected of me. But I genuinely don't want to deal with any of this. It's like the  stupid question of what do you want/ to do? 
- it's hard to answer that question when I don't really want to live. 
Things have gotten better, I feel better but I... Still don't see a reason or have a feeling of I look forward to my future. To what I can do. If I'm being completely honest, I wish didn't have to lie when people ask me that. But can I really say,  oh actually I don't even wanna live, I wish I would be dead. I wish, to do nothing, not working, not wake up, or get up, eat, Etc. 

If I could I would just lay down maybe paint but even then most of the time I don't Do That.  But it's hard. It's hard to explain that feeling, yeah I can sometimes enjoy doing things but most of the time I don't. And yes I have tried changing my perspective, being more greatful, cheerful all these things yet, that numb, empty feeling remains. 

 When I think ugh I wish I wouldn't wake up or get up. Most people just don't like their job or are just saying it as an exaggeration. But I mean it, most days when I open my eyes, I dread the fact that I woke up. It's not because of my job or school. And I want to talk to some about this.

1mcyz3d,Help w/ basic tasks,"Hi all! The biggest thing that I'm currently reflecting on is that I can rarely ever seem to get myself to do anything - which I had always just chalked up to my ADHD but recently got diagnosed w/ depression and was told otherwise. I've been told that there's a difference between typical procrastination and task initiation issues (which are def big for me) and not being able to get yourself out of bed, shower/brush, etc. and I'm done feeling so horrible all the time. I don't want to feel constantly tired and stressed about my lack of hygiene because I feel like those factors just made me feel more miserable and less worthy of living so I know it seem kind of trivial compared to other bigger tasks but if anyone has strategies for creating good habits please let me know what has worked for you all. I'm also going to go to college next year and I really want to get my stuff together for when I move out of my parent's house because I really really don't want to fall back into old patterns from years ago where I just rot in a room all desolate and sad.

1mcwg07,I am ending myself tomorrow,"For background, my fiancé (T) who I had been with for two and a half years had secretly never broken up with his ex (J) who he told me he broke up with after J cheated on him. And about two weeks ago on the 18th, J and I both found out. T and I were visiting his grandparents out of state, which was also the state J lived in. We had also visited them last summer too, and J came over to visit last year too, but as far as I knew T just stayed friends with J after the “breakup”. And as far as J knew, T and I were “just friends”. And T knew, especially after some drama and fights happened last year, that I wasn’t comfortable with J coming over and spending several nights again. And, on the 18th, J found out T had been dating me and engaged to me. And T chose to break things off with me to stay with J. I can kind of understand why he chose him, since J and T had been together for about ~3-4 years and the state J and T’s grandparents lived in was the state T and I were always talking about moving to and planning on moving in a year after I graduate university. But it still hurts so fucking much. And I still love him. I even told him I’d be fine with transferring to a college in the state we were planning on moving right now if he’d take me back. We were planning out our lives together. And I can’t imagine a future without him. T just flew back in tonight (I’m a 20 yo college student, and he’s 19 so we both still live with our families. I went back home from our trip the morning after everything happened). And Friday he leaves to go move in with J. So tomorrow, I’m gonna go see him, say my peace, and go home. And then I’m going to end my own life with a bunch of peanut stuff I bought the other day. I’ve been deathly allergic to peanuts my whole life, so I’m finally gonna get to try them once. I already have my paper note ready for my family, plus some messages to send to family/friends thanking them for being there for me and for being in my life.

1mcs72x,Am I Just Less Than?,"I don't know where else to put these thoughts. I've been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety and recently with CPTSD from childhood emotional abuse and my time trying to teach which ended with a mental breakdown and failure.

I (35m) have a wife (35f) and a son (5m). I'm not sure I'm supposed to feel this way and I think sometimes I'm just whining. I have a house and food to eat, a job. It feels like I'm supposed to be living the dream.

I've been in therapy since 2013. I've always figured there was something wrong with me inherently. I never had a real girlfriend or friends I felt like I connected with. I met my wife in college and for a while i felt like that was behind me.

But recently I left my job teaching because I couldn't take it anymore. The lack of support or understanding from any direction. My peers and bosses never seemed to get it. The kids were amazing. I always felt like a failure trying to help them. I worked in some tough areas,  homeless kids, kids in gangs, some students got shot. I left that to focus on my family because I owed them that and I was freaking out at home.

Since I've done that change I have a new job mostly in an office. People like what I do. But it feels empty. 

My wife hasn't looked at me since we became pregnant. She's dealing with a lot, I don't really blame her. She's working on herself physically. Mentally she's always been more on the dominant side of our relationship. She earns much more money than I do. She controls our finances and how we operate. I seem to just clean the house and the dishes. She's a good mother.

She's going to be gone again for weeks at a time. She travels for work. Achieved an executive role at an early age. I always support her work but it's hurting me that she's gone again. She travels a lot.

I just feel alone. She's the only woman who ever gave me the time of day and she's barely in my life after 8 years of marriage.

I've told her I feel. We've had multiple serious talks. She says she's trying a lot. I believe her but it breaks my heart to live like this sometimes. I feel like no one has ever actually loved me. She always told me people just marry who they're dating when they're 25. Maybe she's right and I was just who was there. Maybe I never found someone who actually cared about me.

But she has been supportive. She helped me get therapy. She's always tried to help me. But she doesn't love me like a husband.

I just don't know what's next. I speak to a therapist. I have a psychiatrist. I take 150mg of venlafaxine daily and trazadone to sleep and weed so often it just doesn't work anymore. I stopped weed a few weeks ago.

I feel like it's all been worthless and like I've just been on the sidelines my entire life and I don't know what to do.

I used to think about just letting the car drift into traffic on my way to work. I don't usually anymore but I still have ideations. I don't own a gun. I do t want to die. But I do t know what else there is for living except to be there for my son.

He's the only reason ",1753834990.0,5,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcs72x/am_i_just_less_than/,2025-07-30 00:23:10+00:00
1mckbg7,Am I gonna find my way out of depression?,"So, I have been facing certain issues from the past three years. During my initial days, I used to feel that I am stuck in a loop where I am happy for 10 days and sad for 20 but it ended real quick and then I went on a work trip to Egypt with a friend of mine. The trip was for a good 40 days but I had to come back home in a week coz I started having major panic attacks and it was my first time. After coming home, I tried therapy but somehow it didn’t go well and I ended up moving above that trip without working out on my issues. Basically my escapism game was on point and after certain period, I entered into a state of numbness. Whenever anybody asked me “how am I doing?”, I had no answers. I wasn’t able to express myself like the way I used to. Things got worse when I started hating on the things I used to love, getting out of my bed became a problem, sleeping more than 11 hours and always being in the numb state. I decided to go to a 10 day vipassana course so that I can sit with myself and figure out what has been going on but the moment i entered into the centre, Egypt happened all over again.

1md06t1,Doomed self-awareness,"This will most likely be all over the place. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe just a place to vent to the abyss.

I've been dealing with depression since I was 9-10 years old. I was always the quiet kid, never had many friends, and felt things too hard. Stuck in my mind 24/7. Barely left my house. This loneliness caught up to me when I actually became aware of it. I finally noticed how the other kids didn't have the same problems that I did. They had friends; they would go out with them and their families. They had lives, multi-faceted lives. 

I always felt I didn't have that.

This self-awareness was probably triggered by a discussion I had with a boy from my class. It was a Catholic school, and I was a pretty edgy kid. He asked if I had made a deal with the devil, and the other kids agreed. It's pretty silly to think about it now, but back then that made me actually look around for the first time and see how cut off I was from the rest of them. That stuck with me.

I didn't have someone to talk about it with, so it snowballed. I became unhappy with myself, not that I was truly happy to begin with, and I wallowed in my despair. Then it became suicidal. I felt I was a burden, so I started planning to stop being a burden. Never actually attempted, but I had the plans, just in case.

I finally asked to see a psychologist when I was 11, even if I felt I got over it. Now I know I never outgrew it like I thought I did; it just became my new normal, and I didn't remember how I felt before it started anymore.

The psychologist I saw didn't do anything, really. I talked to her and told her everything; she tried to teach me some breathing exercises to calm myself and then asked for some kind of hormonal tests (something like that). She asked to speak with my mother alone when I brought the tests, so I just waited outside and didn't get to actually talk to her. My mom just told me she saw the tests and said everything was fine, and I never saw her again.

That was it.

I just learned to live with it. Still lonely, still no friends, still no life, still empty. Covid hit when I was 14, and that was one of my happiest years, even when my father died halfway through it. I didn't have to leave my house anymore, so I was fine. I felt fine, normal.

The years passed. Suddenly I was 17, in the last year of high school. Nothing really changed in my mind.

I had friends now, though, finally. That made things a tiny bit better, even if I felt I was a burden to them most of the time.

One of them used to say I was like a ticking time bomb. I could explode at any moment over anything.

This is something I didn't mention until now. The anger. I am a really angry person when I actually feel some kind of emotion.

I knew something was wrong with me. Now it wasn't just other people's lives that I compared with myself; now it included school. I was always bad at math, even basic shit, but that increased tenfold after the pandemic. I tried teaching myself, my friends tried teaching me, nothing helped, so now I was even more stressed. 

I wanted to see another psychologist again. But this time I couldn't. I was completely dependent on my immediate family to get one for me, and they barely gave a shit. 

So I just had to accept their excuses for the time being.

I then managed to get into a public university right after finishing high school.

So I was pretty lucky when my university offered free mental help.

There, the therapist wanted to send me to a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist for better care. But they didn't have that, so I had to look elsewhere.

So I did the only thing I could; with the documentation in hand, I made enough fuss to get my nurse aunt (my uncle's girlfriend) involved, and she actually stepped up to help me. Got me everything except the neuropsychologist.

So, I'll jump to the present day. I study and work now and got a scholarship, so I get some money for myself to not be fully dependent on my family anymore, because I learned from my mistakes. I still have one of my friends. I should be okay now.

Not really.

I'm 19 now.

I'm still unhappy with myself.

I struggle with university, through all fault of my own. I lack motivation, I lack care, and I don't take care of myself. I starve myself because I can't bring myself to care. I stopped taking my meds for depression and anxiety because I have to buy them, but I don't care. I feel nothing, and when I feel it, it's anger, almost debilitating anger, or sadness.

I fucking hate myself. 

And I'm fully aware of it.

All of my troubles are caused by myself. Stressed because I have essays to write and other work to send? I procrastinated until the very last day because I live in executive dysfunction. Couldn't get the obligatory internship that I need? I was scared, so I pushed it. You get the idea.

I know that I cause my own problems, and what do I do to solve them? Nothing.

Not sure how to end this. My life is not that bad, and yet I thrive in making it worse.",1753860506.0,2,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1md06t1/doomed_selfawareness/,2025-07-30 07:28:26+00:00

1mcvtth,Experiences with Inpatient or Intensive Outpatient?,"In short I'm wondering if it's time for me to get treatment through an inpatient, intensive outpatient, or similar type program and I would really appreciate anyone that can share their experience with these type of programs.

Some background on myself:  
  
I'm in my late 30's and have been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was a kid. It started with anxiety and OCD around 10-12 years old and then depression around 14 years old. I didn't really understand what I was dealing with or that I needed to seek help until I was around 22 years old. It was around that time I first opened up to my parents, but I don't think they grasped how bad I was feeling.

Since then I've seen several psychiatrists and been on a variety of medications and combinations of medications. Some seem to provide a temporary lift, but the weight of the depression is always present. It's really just always feeling bad, with weeks and months of feeling especially bad. The last few years I've worked with a few therapists, but I don't find their guidance very helpful. I'm told that I need to go on daily walks, practice deep breathing, and spend time daily reframing my thoughts. This may be helpful for some, but I feel my issues are deeper and require really unpacking and understanding why I feel the way I do.

The past 8 years or so I've been more open with my parents about what I'm dealing with. They are the only support I have. Recently they noticed I've been especially quiet, closed off, and irritable when they try to ask how I'm doing. 

I have considered an inpatient or intensive outpatient program in the past when my depression was especially bad (impacting by ability to work, declining hygiene, etc.) but ultimately I never went. My parents are now suggesting that I really consider going as they don't see any improvement and if anything see my mental health declining. It's true that I'm just tired of dealing with depression. I live alone, work from home, have no social life. I struggle to get through each day and struggle to sleep. really I feel like I'm just surviving each day just do it again the next day.

I've started looking into inpatient and intensive outpatient options, but it would be great to hear experiences from anyone that has been in one of these types of programs. The thought is that being in a place where I can get daily help and focus on mental health may allow me to experience real progress.   
  
I also need to consider that going to one of these types of programs will likely be expensive and impact my job, so I don't want to do this if the results aren't much better than what I'm getting through working with a psychiatrist and therapist.|

Can anyone share their experience?

1mcuf5n,Writing to Stay Alive,"Between wounds and the hope of healing : writing to stay alive.

I cry form within, my troubles will drown. But they've learned how to swim. I fall asleep with a heavy heart, dreaming of forgetting the pain. But each morning, misery leaps at my face and sinks in its sharp claws. My features, now distorted, force me to wear a mask to hide the fatigue and the ugliness. In secret, tears finally rise and irrigate my thin, sensitive skin. A masquerade, that’s what my life has become. Condemned by the shame of appearing vulnerable, I flee from myself until I forget who I  really am.

So I write to search through myself. In the depths of the cosmos, I scan the horizon for the abyss. This dark side, this black hole that devours every trace of vitality without pity. I keep my distance, afraid it will consume what remains : my writing. In the midst of chaos, I try to shape some order, and in these paragraphs, find meaning. Ink replaces tears, words become blades. Each sentence grazes my heart. A period and several stitches to stop the bleeding. There’s too much blood, I feel less and less alive.

A fading vitality sparks a war where the battlefield is my own heart. My body becomes the graveyard of my emotions and the coffin of my soul. I carry my tombstone on my back : the weight of an existence where the heart no longer knows how to love.

The hour is dark. The biggest star has collapsed. It is not a supernova. Turn off the light, they serve no purpose. Turn off the spotlight, the masquerade is over. I can remove the mask and reveal myself. Bring me some paper and a pen. The stars still fascinate me, however black holes intrigue me.",1753841272.0,2,3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcuf5n/writing_to_stay_alive/,2025-07-30 02:07:52+00:00

I just want one person to show me that I'm not. I don't want to hear those words of ""You are not alone"". I don't want to hear them. I want to see them.

Which seems a lot more normal than it is for others but for me it isn’t because I’ve spent an entire year being basically a social outcast and friendless. Which caused me to have social anxiety and depression. And no I’m not talking about some “oh my god I only have like 2 friends I have no friends!!” I literally had 0 people to talk to other than my family. Anyways, in the last year I’ve moved schools and I’ve met new people. The new people introduced me to more new people and blah blah u get it, with medicine and socialising with people overtime im basically healed from my social anxiety kinda. But my depression isn’t gone. I have suicidal thoughts daily and although I won’t go and kill myself I really do think about it like DEEP. and ill always tell myself when I think about killing myself, “I know my mental health isn’t as bad as it was 2 years ago” but I also feel so goddamn empty at the same time. It just still feels like I have no one to live for and nobody would really care if I just went ahead and killed myself. Another reason I wanna kill myself is because I just feel so goddamn ugly, like I’ll always ask people about my appearance to ensure myself I don’t look ugly even though people tell me I’m not ugly I just still feel so ugly and pathetic for even asking people about my appearance.

I don't know, don't bother reading, I just wanted to vent.","He has always had that behavior But it wasn't until the second year together that he met a woman who worked in the cafeteria at his work, he fell in love with her and they had a relationship for a year I guess until I discovered it and the woman went to his ranch to live. He wanted to do things well, forgive him (typically stupid) just at that time he was liquidated at his job and of those 120 thousand pesos to me as his wife who was with him from scratch and obviously we lived together and everything only He gave 500 pesos and why did I ask him for a loan if not nothing, because he became very lazy, he drank too much and took drugs and I was still there, I barely saw him and when I saw him he hit me and treated me horrible...
Well I got pregnant!🤦🏻‍♀️ 
He continued in the same way, he started to say that the baby was not his, he continued to hit me despite being pregnant several times, I left home, he looked for me, and he came back as an idiot, apart from the fact that the house where we lived, we moved it together, belonged to the two of us, and whenever I left, it was with my family, and he struggled a lot. For me, when he hit me and took drugs, I spent the entire pregnancy crying, he didn't help me at all, and I cleaned and carried heavy loads. In short, to this day we are still together around the house because of the baby and why with his condition, I can't go to work and have someone take care of him. He doesn't want to do it. The truth is I'm tired I feel so alone My life hurts so much If it wasn't for my baby I would have already committed suicide I know that the 2 older ones will go with their dad and they would be fine But the youngest one has a difficult life from now on, I really don't want to go back to the depression I had before the baby He cut my arms and legs I even took pills It took up to 3 days without eating I always walk with my swollen eyes I'm always crying I'm really tired I don't know how I can love someone who has treated me so badly He humiliates me He hits me He insults me, he treats me so badly, I'm trapped, I don't know what to do, where to go, I want to die 😭😭😭

1mc0wou,My life was over before it ever even began. (rant),"I'm a 33 year old man. I wasted my entire young life wallowing in self-loathing, and indulging in destructive habits, mental, emotional, and physical. I've never been athletic and I was never taught anything about nutrition. I was smart when I was young, but lazy, and a chronic procrastinator. Needless to say my mind and my body have just about wasted away.

About a year ago I made the decision to join the Army. I had nothing going for me anyways. I hated the menial, servile jobs I was working. The military was a huge opportunity for somebody like me. Not only would I be getting payed to be trained in a field that is actually my dream job, I would have a chance to change my mind, and my body around.

I've been putting in a ton of effort. I gave up drinking alcohol, I gave up caffeine to help fix my sleep, I completely overhauled my diet to the point of being obsessive, and I've been exercising harder than I've ever exercised in my life... or so I thought. For all my effort, I haven't seen any much improvement if at all. I don't feel stronger at the gym, running never gets any easier, and I don't look any better. But I acknowledge that it's my fault. I guess I'm actually not trying as hard as it feels like. I'm weak as hell, and although I sweat a lot and strain my muscles, I always leave the gym feeling like I could have and should have done more. People say that exercise is great for depression, but I often leave feeling down, and angry at myself for being so inferior. I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been in my life and it's so pathetic to say that my best is still worse than the base line.

I feel like I only just started truly trying, and yet it feels like it's already too late. I feel old. My body hurts. I have knee and lower back pain. I'm ugly, I hate my body, I have no confidence. I'm surrounded by young, athletic guys in their prime. They're smarter that me, have more going for them than me. I don't fit in with anybody. I feel like I don't get other people and other people don't get me. I don't have any friends here or back at home. I feel lonely, sad and angry all the time, and I don't have anybody to talk to.

1mcorg2,"Being in a constant state of depression for months, now I've lost hope","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Lately I've been having this feeling that my depression is a lost cause. I've heard that counselling and regular exercising would help alleviate such conditions and I took it to heart: doing counseling twice a month for the past year and I've been exercising pretty regularly. Counseling did help me identify and fix short term temporal issues that did improve some aspects of my problems but I feel like something isn't still going right and I'm sort of still on the decline.

Over the past two months I have had two extremely acute depressive episodes to the point I didn't eat or sleep well for days. Even today as I was on my regular cycling run I felt extremely down and desolate. I'm extremely afraid that even after doing the right things I'm still not about to recover, and for some days I feel like my the deterioration has only been slowed but never halted. 

I grew up in a household where mental health isn't a thing. Having pretty non understanding parents doesn't really help, especially when they tell you things like ""spend more time with us"" or ""why should you even have depression"" when I was younger. I'm covertly seeking help right now, so they don't even know about all this.

All friends I’ve made have ghosted me, and the time period we’ve stayed friends has been getting shorter. I feel like I make kids my age uncomfortable or annoyed. I’m boring, weird and don’t have any real substance as a person, and I’m like a background character in the world. I talk to a therapist, and although I feel a little better after we talk; I don’t ever feel like I’ve really changed.

1mcn94b,I Have No Freedom,"Let me elaborate. My home doesn't even feel like a home. It feels more like a prison that I was sentenced to for life. Why? I have a learning disability as well as epilepsy, which means I am unable to take care of myself so I'm stuck living with my parents for my whole life. My epilepsy prevents me from doing anything like transporting myself from Point A to Point B, so ever getting a job is out the window. I have no friends and highly doubt anyone would want to be friends with someone that they have to transport everywhere. My life at home doesn't do anything to lift my spirit either. I'm addicted to video games because it's my escape from this reality I'm forced to live in, and my parents aren't very happy about it either. They're always complaining about it, especially my mom. My mom complains about a lot of things about me like my apparent ""Lack of effort"" to clean the house, even though I do it, so it's not like I'm lazy. She also hates that I wear a lot of black clothes and always buys more colorful clothing for me. It's not my fault that the clothes I like came in black. Some of my favorite animes, superheroes and other stuff were depicted on them. I didn't choose them for the color or anything like that. It's only a coincidence that the color represents how I feel. I've been depressed since around 2017/18, the middle of high school, and I'm forced to live a lie by telling everybody (Mostly my parents and doctors) that everything is okay every time they ask when it's not.

1mc7gom,I just want someone to listen but I can't speak.,"In real life, I can't talk to anyone, I don't put any effort into maintaining or creating any sort of relationship / friendship because I just don't want to talk. But I am so desperate to be heard by someone.

Diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression and recently borderline personality disorder.

I have a three year old child, full time single parent. Currently studying online. Live alone in a rented property with my child. They are the only reason I don't end it all right now.

I have no family. Well I have parents and a brother but they are unwell and it is hard to see them as we live far apart. 

Child's father is not involved in her life. DV.

I thought I would have been so much more by now. Happily married, nice house, following my dreams, being successful.... and the reality is I am crying while writing at my computer to strangers, hoping someone somewhere has a nugget of wisdom that will keep me going. If I didn't have my child I promise I would end it all, but I can't leave her, she would end up in someone elses care and no one would love her like I do or give her everything as I so desperately try to.

I am so alone. I have been single for three years. When I was young I always had boyfriends etc. Which when digging deeper, was probably due to childhood trauma.

I am so aware of time, life feels surreal and I'm desperate for game over. ",1753783549.0,13,5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc7gom/i_just_want_someone_to_listen_but_i_cant_speak/,2025-07-29 10:05:49+00:00
1mc9ynf,Ruined my life.,"Ive only been truly in love with one person since I was 15, I’m 25 now. The only meaning and purpose ive made in life was to love this girl. She was the only person I would’ve married and had a family with.

It’s been over three months since we broke up and I know deeply that I will never love someone again because I’ve never been able to. I try but no one is ever her. 

Prior to this year I had to end a six year relationship because all I ever did was dream about this girl even after not talking to her for six years. 

My life now is dreaming about what could’ve been, her having children with the new guy etc. it’s very rare I don’t wake up from dreaming about her. No matter what I accomplish or do I think about her every morning and night. Nothing matters anymore I just do good things hoping one day something will work out but I know deep down there is no plan B and I’ll be haunted by this relationship for the rest of my life. 

Ultimately she probably did love me and I ruined the best thing that will ever happen to me. I won the lottery and blew it. I’d trade all the money in the world to just to live in a tent with her.

1mc8pg5,Contemplating about Suicide that I was very sure to commit,"For the past two months, I’ve been thinking about ending my life more than ever before. I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, and although I’ve had a few serious attempts in the past, this time feels different.

This time, I’m not acting impulsively. I’ve made a plan. I’ve picked a date. And with each passing day, it feels more like something I’m meant to do. I’ve even researched famous suicides looking for inspiration, trying to make sure nothing can go wrong.

I’m currently in therapy and on antidepressants, even on the maximum dose, but nothing seems to change. Today I told my therapist everything: the method, the plan, and why I feel so certain this time. He asked how he could help, and I told him nothing could this is a final decision, and nothing in this world could change it. I was completely sure until I got home.

Now, I’m torn again. Part of me still believes that my problems are too deep and permanent to ever be solved at least not within my lifetime. I don’t just hate myself. I feel like I was never meant to exist among other people. Like I’m something else entirely. That I don’t belong here, that I never will.

Even if I kept going, nothing would really change. I’ll always feel this way. Suicide doesn’t feel like a choice it feels like my destiny. But then something my therapist said made me pause. It made me feel guilty. I don’t know how to go from here. What would you do?

I don’t know. I can’t elaborate better than this I would like to do but I’m just tired.

Anyways, straight to the point..I just feel like committing. It’s just such an overwhelming urge and I can’t fucking take it. Its the thought of like would anyone care? My cats would be taken care of by my sister, my brothers dog that I watch for him has well..my brother to take care of her. I’d take the burden off my parents because I feel like they complain at me all the time. However, it could totally be my fault so. Like I get that I don’t clean my room as often as I should but it’s just clothes usually so? And complaining that I got my dad a card and chocolate for his birthday just because my sister got him something more? Like sorry that he literally told her what he wanted?! Anywho..I just genuinely feel like I’m a burden to them and it just makes me feel so awful. Then, my friends I just don’t know. They’re all much closer and go out all the time, talk to each other all the time and I just don’t. I met them through my friend because she goes to the same college as all of them apart from one and yet he’s still closer to them all lol. What I’m trying to say I guess is that there’s nothing for me. There’s no point in actually living anymore. Sure if you think about it, I have like my whole life ahead of me because I’m young but it doesn’t really feel like it you know? I don’t even want to go back to college. It just doesn’t seem fun anymore and I actually really enjoyed my first year. Ugh, it’s all just so stupid and I should be grateful for what I have but I just can’t take it anymore. I have such bad body issues and whatever. Like I can’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore. I genuinely feel so ashamed when I eat in public or just in front of someone because I feel like they’re gonna judge me or something. I just feel self conscious no matter what honestly. I was also doing so good with my sh and then I relapsed not too long ago and it’s so fucking pathetic. I just hate living like this. I hate it so much and I don’t want to feel like this anymore but I just feel like the only way to stop it is by ending it. Like no one would actually be affected in their everyday lives so.

1mcqta6,She claims this traumatic memory didn't happen,"
TW: suicidal thoughts & ideation

We were arguing about my sister. She said I'm not allowed to cut in her parenting. I said to my mom that she often ingores our problems until they blow up in her face. She said to give her examples. So I did.

I remember how I first started having suicidal thoughts for months. I didn't know what to do and was so tired. We were getting ready for school. I took a kitchen knife and put it to my throat. I told her I want to kill myself. I told her I wanted to die.

She talked me out of it. She took the knife. She made me stay home and took my sister to school. She stayed home from work. I remember I read a book (the candy shop war by brandon mull). She came back and told me ""your sister asked me why you wanted to cut yourself"". I told her I feel like a burden to her, like some trash that got stuck to her and is just weighing her down (I remember using the word velcro).

She made me go to work with her for a few days. I found her old school notebook and was looking through it cause I liked the colors. I was sitting at her work drawing anime girls. But she didn't do anything, didn't take me to therapy, didn't ask anyone for help.

She made me go to confession. Said those thoughts were a sin. I remember the priest, can't remember which tho. He told me about his car accident and how grateful to god he is for life, and i should be too. I remember feeling guilty and like I was gonna go to hell.

Mom claims she doesn't remember this and it didn't happen. She started grilling me for details, and I got anxious, cause I couldn't remember which grade I was in, which job she took me to, which priest I talked to. She said she can't understand my point cause she doesn't remember this.

Then I would talk about suicide all the time after that. I texted my mom a poem about suicide and she came to my school cause she was worried I would do something to myself. I asked a friend ""what do you think is better - suicide or murder?"", she told her parents, who told my mom. She knew. She knew. She knew and neglected this.

Am I making it up? am I lying? I don't remember all the details, am I a bad person for talking about it and mixing stuff up? She was the one who asked me for examples. I am just so confused and don't know what to think. Am I a liar? Im so scared that I'm lying. I have been holding onto this and all the unimportant details are clear in my head, cause I was mentally ill and using escapism, like books and drawing, to deal with it. And she neglected me and my health, just like she is neglecting my sister's health. Which is why I butt in to protect my sister.

I'm so scared that this memory is somehing I made up, cause she denies it happening. Please somebody help, I don't have therapy for another week.",1753831215.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcqta6/she_claims_this_traumatic_memory_didnt_happen/,2025-07-29 23:20:15+00:00

1mcq1us,Physically Paralized/Heavy?,"Has anyone ever felt like their speech or body wouldn't respond?

I'm dealing with moderate depression and anxiety, and sometimes (not necessarily during moments of stress or panic) it feels like my body is heavy and that I'm going to become paralyzed, unable to react. It has never actually happened that I couldn’t move, but it’s really scary!

I’ve felt this even when I wasn’t taking any medication, and now I’m experiencing it again while taking Lyrica 25 mg (first week of treatment).

1mcof74,I don't want to keep going.,"I've had depression my whole life, and my living situation has also not been very depression-friendly. I've been on and off of medication for years, being discharged and admitted back again constantly.
The place where I live isn't in the best condition and the hood in itself is dangerous and depressing. I have been unemployed for years and have been applying but not being called from anywhere, so my chances of moving are slim. I grew up very lonely, only child/niece/grand daughter, and there were never other kids around. I was bullied and harassed, and went through s*xual abuse twice. 
My life changed last year when I met the love of my life. He's from Germany, and I'm from Costa Rica, but our connection was instant and we clicked in a way that was perfect. I went to visit him earlier this year and my time with him was magical... but he broke up with me earlier this month because he is also very depressed and in no condition to sustain a relationship. 
That relationship was the light of my life.
Now I feel lonely, I see no light, meds only help me sleep but I see no improvement, life looks gray, meaningless. I see no future.
With him, I imagined a life with someone who finally loved me just as much as I loved him, and family, a small house in a place that isn't life threatening...
But now I have nothing, not even love.
I miss him. I don't want to give my heart to anyone else ever.
Memories of the times we shared haunt me daily.
The environment around me makes me wanna crawl in my couch and never open an eye again.
I go to therapy, I take my meds, I pet my cat.
But every day I sink a little lower, and the ache in my chest is deeper.
I don't want this life anymore.

Hallo zusammen,
ich bin 24 (w) und hab seit einiger Zeit immer wieder das Gefühl, dass ich Freundschaften ""verlieren"" könnte, wenn ich mich nicht aktiv melde. Oft denke ich: Wenn ich niemandem schreibe, schreibt auch keiner mir. Das macht mich ziemlich unsicher und ich zweifle dann an mir selbst und an der Beziehung zu den Leuten, auch wenn es eigentlich gute Freund*innen aus der Uni oder dem Alltag sind.

Ich merke auch, dass ich sehr auf Bestätigung von anderen angewiesen bin – sei es durch eine Nachricht, ein Treffen oder einfach nur, dass jemand zeigt, dass er oder sie an mich denkt. Wenn das ausbleibt, fühlt es sich schnell so an, als sei ich jemandem egal. Gleichzeitig weiß ich aber auch, dass andere ja auch ein Leben haben und man nicht immer ständig Kontakt haben muss.

Kennt das jemand von euch? Wie geht ihr mit diesem Bedürfnis nach Bestätigung und der Angst, vergessen oder ""fallen gelassen"" zu werden, um?

Würde mich freuen, eure Gedanken zu hören.",1753820990.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcmlxv/fühle_mich_oft_unsicher_in_freundschaften_bin_ich/,2025-07-29 20:29:50+00:00

1mc1852,Hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either.

I lay in bed doom scrolling or sleeping, i don’t remember the last time I showered properly or brushed my teeth or ate a healthy meal or gone out unless my sister is pulling me along to do errands. My closest friends are just going out without me now and i don’t care anymore. I feel sad at first and then remember i probably stink, I don’t want to get out of my comfortable clothes, who wants to talk in person anyway and I have no energy to walk anymore so i stay at home. ai started cancelling on everything after i spent weeks pleading with people to let me go out with them but they couldn’t or wouldn’t. I don’t care. I got sad and now i don’t care. I want to talk to my friends but i’ve been prioritizing other people instead of myself and my issues which is making me feel worse.

I feel useless.

1mclxwj,"The girl I had situationship with is depressed, has amnesia. don’t know what to do next","So we were very close for about 3 months, and at the beginning of our talking, we confessed we really did like each other, but she told me she needs time to heal from her past relationship plus know each other better. 
She is a super kind soul, really, I don’t think I have ever met or seen such kind, caring, and righteous person.

After 2,5 months of the talking, she was ill for a week, had low mood. After she got kinda well, she out of nowhere for me told me that she thinks we should stay friends. Obviously, I asked her why, but she kept saying “you deserve better”, “I don’t have a future”, “I don’t want you to go down with me”. I could not really understand all of this because it seemed like there isn’t any reason for this. I had not met people with depression before this happened, I guess that’s why I could not apprehend anything. But I just had to accept it and move on. 

Apparently she had some neurological illness, and at exactly that time it worsened, and so did her depression I think. We went back to our hometowns, have not talked (since we had a beef, but it doesn’t matter that much now) until yesterday. She texted me. And I know it might sound crazy, but apparently her illness got worse, she fainted and hit her head. She got amnesia, and she texted me to apologise cause she felt she did something horrible that hurt me, but she couldn’t recall what exactly. I told her, she recalled most of it and sincerely apologised. And I forgave her. 

Now the situation is that she still thinks she cannot have a future, does not have interest in future, and doesn’t wanna live. I want to help her. She apparently went to many therapists, but no one actually helped, so I don’t know what to do. She says she feels like that for a very long time, 10 years I think. 

I don’t know if her depression will be cured, so I don’t know if I can want to be in a relationship with her (if she reconsiders). I am afraid that would be a big burden to be with someone with depression, but I think I don’t know if that is even possible to be in a relationship like that happily. 

It would be great if you can share what it is like to have such depression, how to deal with it, and how should I perceive this. I am very worried about her.

1mclnpy,Trying to express the benefits of working 1st shift when it comes to depression,"I know what it is to be stuck in the cycle, barely able to even maintain proper care of yourself. 

My way of coping , or helping myself in any way I could..was to force myself into situations that I feel would be beneficial.  Even if I have to fight the dark draw to lay there through my alarms. 

I've worked 2nd and third shift jobs my whole life. A night owl through and through . It required the least amount of interaction and effort,  and when I was promoted,  I often crumbled under the anxiety caused by depression.  The feeling of worthlessness. 

But I got a new job, 1st shift, outdoors. The effects were...immediate. 

In a visual sense, colors were brighter. My body adjusted to a sleep schedule that I found super beneficial to me as a human.  And physically. 

That physical boost in turn gave me a mental one. I lost weight that I had gained sitting there in my head trying to escape from what felt like crushing weights of responsibility.  

There is NO one size fits all to depression. There's not. Im not ln a pedestal telling you what will fix you. 

But friends, it's so easy to forget (in this shitty, money driven world) that we are not nocturnal creatures. That we are designed to wake with the sun. I blew it off until I was forced to live this way.  


Even something as simple as waking up to the smell of a houseplant does wonders for your mental health. 

Im not breathing air yet, but I can damn sure see the surface. If this helps anyone experience even slight relief from being painfully stuck in the loop , then im glad it did. 

Get some sun , yall. Keep breathing.

But uh I honestly am glad I left that job because it was casing my anxiety to be at an all time high constantly on alert and I have 4 panic attacks over the course of a month.

1mcf75w,Am I Suffering from depression ?,"Today I realized I might be going through depression. For the past 7-8 months, I was depressed about a love interest lost. Then suddenly it shifted from that to an easy life which I left in past. Which was a myth-
There
1. I used to constantly work from 10-8pm, with very little break
2. Used to crib
3. Had job security

Now given my current role, for the past 7 months-
1. I’ve barely worked maybe 3 hours a day
2. Some days just didn’t work
3. Imagining the other life was good 

Then suddenly I frantically started thinking of ways to go back to previous life , imagining every scenario where I could have gone back. Fighting with everyone why they didn’t tell me. Imagining a perfect life I left behind. 
The thoughts took a dark turn where I imagined I might end it all and be done with it , my life is finished anyway. 
Then I started researching ways to go, planning date. But each method had a risk, what if you don’t go, you’ll damage your brain or become dependent, so it scared me. 
Money wise , even if I would have stayed in past job , I would have been earning same or less only. 
Suddenly I prayed to God for a sign and I talked with a potential love interest. She was so upbeat about her life and didn’t care about job title and was enjoying her life. Her attitude sparked something in me. It gave me hope.
And suddenly I realized , I might be depressed. that the easy life I’m looking doesn’t exist. Pretty sure if I had stayed back then I would be thinking the same only or worse. 
I’m just scared of working and putting in effort and expect an easy life , which I know doesn’t exist. 
I remember last year , I was pretty optimistic , putting in hours at work , getting appreaciation and losing a love interest caused me to go down this rabbit hole. 
Any advice someone can give me would be helpful. After the conversation with a potential new love interest , sparked that drive in me a little. I want to live this life to the fullest, grow and improve and live to the end of my natural life happily and not shy away from hardwork and beat the illusion of easy life.

1mcbqv9,I thought being attractive would make me happy. It doesn’t.,"   I used to be really skinny and kinda ugly in high school. I never really believed I could have a relationship with a girl, and it didn’t really bother me. I was happy, or at least content, playing video games, drinking beer, and delivering pizzas. 

   Fast forward a few years and I guess I had a bit of a glow up. I started working out and eating better, I started wearing more flattering clothes, and my face changed. I’m not sure how to explain it, but when I look at old photos now, my face definitely looks more grown and handsome now. For the first time in my life, I could be considered fairly attractive. I wasn’t aware of this AT ALL. I guess because it’s hard to notice change when it’s so gradual? 

   So I had this coworker. She was a couple years my junior, and she was so so beautiful. I work with a couple older ladies and they all kinda joke that we would be cute together. I would laugh it off always, still maintaining the old idea that no girl would want to be with me. We were kinda flirty though, and so I thought, ‘what the hell,’ and just asked her out one day. She said yes, and I thought she was just being polite. Again, at this point I had no idea that I’m a pretty good looking guy. 

   So we go see a movie and it goes really well; we made out in the theatre and we were laughing and talking and later I dropped her off. For the next few months we text almost nonstop and we see each other at work all the time. We would meet up at night a few times, but other than that, we almost never saw each other outside of work. This was for reasons I don’t really want to get into. 

   Anyway, I learned during our talks that she always thought I was really hot. I want to reiterate that this girl was beautiful. She was really pretty, had an amazing body, she had a bold but cute personality, she was amazing. When she told me she thought I was hot, it completely changed how I saw myself. 

   We were never really dating, but whatever we had ended. I don’t want to get into the details. Afterwards, I felt fine for a while. I had a new confidence in myself. I saw two other girls in the months following that. It actually surprised me how easily I could meet other girls now. The problem was I couldn’t connect with any of them and I didn’t know why. I stopped seeing the girl I was seeing, and I couldn’t really explain to her why I wanted to end it. I just left. 

   And then this sadness entered my life. Overwhelming, crushing sadness. Like nothing I’d ever felt before, ever. At first it was so intense I didn’t know what to do. I would just ball up in my bed and sob because I literally didn’t know what else to do, the feeling was so awful. 

   I thought this feeling was a symptom of grief for losing the first girl, but it’s been so long. And I still feel like this all the time. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. 

   Fast forward a few months, and now I’m here. I haven’t met anyone new, and I’m not trying to. I’m afraid to. I’ve been trying to understand my emotions better, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed I haven’t really been sad. However, I haven’t been happy either, or angry, or anything. I’ve just kind of felt numb. I think maybe I’ve been bottling up my emotions subconsciously, because the other night I bawled my eyes out for no apparent reason. Nothing really bad happened that day, so I don’t know why I felt like that. 

   Anyways, I just thought writing down my thoughts would maybe make me feel better. Realistically I think I need therapy. I’m not sure if I’m depressed, but I’m trying every day to understand myself better. Peace and love be with you all.

1mcf3ew,Hard Mode ++,"Life has always be hard. I mean, abuse, going deaf at age of 6, SA by a female tutor, dropping out of High school cuz I couldn't understand whatever they taught. Working in factories even though I've got asthma. 

So yeah, life has been hard. But there were some silver linings. Like finding a job that wasn't factory and a lover. 

Sadly both things are the very reason why I'm tired to the bone. 

With love, we brokeup after 7 years, cuz her parents didn't like me, which is valid considering I don't like me either. Then with work, I work as a content writer, getting a good job before the AI thing was hard, now it's downright impossible. 

I ask, I show my work and it's always a no, because I'm goddamn deaf. A liability. If I share my work with a friend and ask them to apply. They get the job. Of course the said friend doesn't know me after that, only does when they need something. 

I write over 120k words a month and make barely $260. Which obviously isn't enough. 

All I wanted and still want was to live happily, I'd planned to take mum for a holiday and take my first holiday in 6 years next year, now I'm wondering if I'll be able to do it. 

I'm tired. I'm trying to learn things like SEO or PPC, but they need hands on experience, which means I have to apply for such jobs. Sadly nobody accepts. And since I'm 27, I don't have enough time to learn better skills like web development cuz there's always younger talent available.

Why am I telling y'all all this? I don't know. I shouldn't. All my efforts to mend life are going to vain, and that makes me scared of what's ahead.

1mcl2lp,I have a lot of trouble with hugs and human contact.,"Don't get me wrong, I loooove hugs, cuddles, and certainly don't mind other forms of human touch in a lot of cases... but my self-esteem is terrible so I often feel like I'm not worthy of it or I'll make people hate or despise me if I try to even ask. In the rare occurrence that I do try and ask someone for a hug it's often a struggle to vocalize or communicate my desire due to an extreme fear of rejection. This makes me feel very lonely and unlovable and in the worst cases like I would be better off dead so they don't have to worry about me bothering them. However, logically, I understand reality is different and I've had plenty of people hug me seemingly without issue, so why the hell can't I get these feelings outta my head?",1753817514.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcl2lp/i_have_a_lot_of_trouble_with_hugs_and_human/,2025-07-29 19:31:54+00:00

1mck67f,Mom passed away and I’m lost in life,"Hi everyone, as the title says, my mom recently passed away in the beginning of April. She had been dealing with heart problems for about two years until it just got to be too much for her body to handle. Since her passing I’ve felt to be completely lost in my life and this world. I’m only 21 but she was my everything, no matter what situation we where going through or how her health was, she always made sure that I didn’t have to worry and it didn’t matter how small or large the issue was. I could call her at anytime of the day, stressed out about something and by the end of the call, she would always make me feel like everything would be okay. Now that she’s gone, it feels like nothing will ever be okay. Every big event that could possibly happen in my life, birthdays, holidays, getting married, having kids, I just know I’ll be thinking of my mom and wishing she was also here to experience those moments. When I was sitting in hospice with her, waiting for the inevitable, it felt like the world had stopped and ever since her passing it feels like my world is still stuck while everyone else’s picked up again. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I shut my eyes at the end of the night I think about my mom and I know that won’t ever end. I’d do anything just to talk to her one more time. Thankfully I have my sister and father to talk too but the grief sometimes is too hard to deal with, even with support. I’m sorry if this post was all over the place, I’ve never actually posted in a community before but I just needed my words to be heard/read because it’s so hard to keep myself together most days.

I decided I was feeling better so came off them slowly. I was fine for a while and now I can feel the depression (and with it some social anxiety) coming back. Nowhere near as bad as before - I’m not bed-bound, I can get up and go to the gym, see friends, go to work etc. But I feel irritable and generally down and it’s affecting the people around me. I feel going back on antidepressants would help, though I was really hoping to manage without them. One other aspect putting me off is wanting to try for kids in future and not wanting to be on medication. 

So my questions really are:

1) Should I keep trying to manage my mental health issues without medication? Any tips?

1mcani9,I want to kill myself just to be at ease and peace,"Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, why these three elements made their home in me. I have been depressed my whole life, even as a child I couldn't live it perfectly coz of our financial situation and sexual harassment. Back then, I just thought this sexual assault is a game so every time that person asked I would go. Didn't engaged in any other activities, didn't make friends, nothing at all. I know no one going to read this long-long story but I don't know why I wanted to write it here and I have no idea what could that obvious reason be, I just wanna do it. 

 
My first depression episode started when I was giving my final 12th exam but it was not that extreme then, when I got in collage, I made some friends who made my depression worst being soo selfish and always make feel left out and some of other things were there too that made me realize all a man wants is sex, not love not anything and it did hit me so hard. I attempted suicide, but then I saw my parents it made me realize this is not an option I have to be strong and make our life better. Without external help I overcame the depression, I worked hard got a good job bought a house for ourselves - finally we didn't have to live in rented house. We were happy and its been 2 years in our new home. 

But as I think I am cursed I cannot be happy for long, My wedding is scheduled in oct and I have no savings, and what more happened? I lost my job. Everything's falling apart. I cannot enjoy the only thing I will experience once in my life, I have bills to pay, EMIs and more imp wedding. The lay off got me so hard, my depression is triggered again and I am harming myself more than ever now. I am not able to see a future so I just want to be dead or sleep all the time so that I don't have to face the reality. It's been 2 months since my lay off, haven't got even a single offer after applying restlessly day and night. Life is tough, I know they are trails, but I just wanted to be happy at my wedding. Most importantly I can cancel the wedding but what about the home I bought for my family, who will give EMIs, everything's fuckedup.  

Since I am not getting any job, I can still save my house but it requires me dead, just want to know what are some tactics to suicide and make it look natural?

1mcih0k,Physical Health vs Mental Health,"I am 25F. I have been depressed most of my life. There isn't anything wrong with my life as such. It is just what it is. I am going to the ""bad"" part of the cycle where I stop doing anything that is not extremely necessary. By that I mean, I don't even have energy to cut a fruit, or warm milk or anything. I have literally been living on biscuits and milk for the last 2 weeks and it is definitely not good. 

I did go to a psychiatrist and a psychologist, but their meds and stuff are gonna take time for me to feel the change. I had been working on my physical health for a few months and just when I finally felt I was able to shed a few kgs, the depression is back and I can see all my hardwork go down the drain and there is nothing I am able to do about it. 

How do I go out in such conditions? How do I even go for a walk? Or a swim, something I love a lot? How do I pick myself out of bed?

I am seeing myself destroy all the progress and I know what I have to do, but my body and brain refuse to coordinate 😭😭",1753811711.0,1,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcih0k/physical_health_vs_mental_health/,2025-07-29 17:55:11+00:00
1mc7omw,I've been so depressed that now I cant even share anything with anyone.,"I've been depressed for the past 5 years and even more so the last three years. This past year I've spent most of my time couped up in my room, procrastinating on everything. Pure nihilism and suicidal ideations. I only go out once or twice a week with one old friend who reaches out. Even then I just pretend. 

Because of this depression I got into religion more to understand things better, with it lots of theology videos and philosophy. Anything to just get me to a new place of thinking.

What happened in turn, (even though I was a lefty) I became agnostic atheist. Now I am even in deeper meaningless-ness. And I can't share this with my family because in thier minds it doesn't need to be that deep. So I just pretend now, it truly is a new kind of aloneness. I am lonely too time to time but it doesnt bother me. 

Im very close to ending it all but what stops me is the pain it will cause my family. But truly if I can't even push myself to do basic things and not be afraid, overwhelmed and flustered what's the point? I could somehow in the past push through it all. But now the responsibility to just live and exist feels too much. 

To get up to shower, to brush my teeth. I did all this in the past because I had to, because external factors like school and work made me do them. But I still felt optimistic about life then. 

Now I wake up and I wish why I hadn't died in my sleep.

No matter how hard I try, all my might and grit arent enough stop be from being here.  Its quiet now all the time- i wake up to nothing and I return home to a half life.

Its all gone, the stitching has unfurled.  This hell is sweet; it exists because of love. 

I hate this place. 

I wish for peace. For  rest and for silence, there was a time I tasted pieces of each- but never a full plate.  

Was i ever real?, was anything?, were you?.  

I see proof; screenshots of messages so I wouldnt forget things loved and wanted; I was once among them.

After so much death to have such little light steal itself away from me?- maybe I am the things ive been told.  I know im not all bad- I just dont have the reminder.

The bed is warm and lonley, the kitchen table has four chairs  only one  is ever used.   I sit i wait and watch the sun through the window.  3 months so far- to me you were lost yesterday; I wonder if you could remember me- would you even choose to?.  Am I  cursed to carry another weight forever?, will i withstand and endure the sand filled winds at the edge of that pit or is it to strong finally. 

My heart splintered, parts vanquished and fetitd  full of rot- it isnt a new fact but the taste is getting to me.  

I've buried, pets friends, parents and now I have to find a way to mourn you in some new way. 
 How can i mourn the loss of light when its hard to rememeber its warmth?. 

You gave me hope, you dashed it in a manner of seconds; one decision- years gone never to return.

Now I found out, that this relationship was a lie. He doesn't love me. He was my ""lifeboat"" (sound ironic I know haha), and now it feels like I'm drowning. It's like in the past, If not even worse.

   - Saw FDA warnings about heart rhythm problems  
   - Already feel ""heavy headed"" from fluoxetine

  1. Is this combo *ever* safe without special testing first? (Like heart tests?)

I miss them, but I don’t want to talk to them either. Maybe I’m just obsessed with attention. I don’t know. I just wish I could live the rest of my life in bed, listening to Kanye, slowly rotting to death. But I can’t. I can’t kill myself either. I don’t have the courage to do it.

1mc77fd,How do I get past my greif,"I am an 18m and within the last few weeks I have felt an immense amount of guilt and I have been left feeling stuck in a perpetual state of numbness and confusion. With the help of medical professionals I have been given a Zoloft prescription that I have started taking within the last week. I am disgusted with myself and I want to grow and get past my guilt. I am responsible for the death of my family dog on behalf of my negligence. I regret not being there to care for him. I am sick to my stomach with how careless I was at the time of his passing, I held I’m in my arms when he died, I can’t begin to imagine the way my dog had felt as he passed away. I know that I should learn from my experience and I feel as if I have failed my dog, my family as well as myself. There are a lot more details that I can provide, but currently I’m not in a good position to talk about it fully. My psychiatrist has told me about therapy for PTSD and other traumas but I don’t know about it. What is EMDR therapy? How does it work? How do I grow and learn to forgive myself? I feel stuck in the past event, I feel haunted by him. People in my life keep telling me how it wasn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel responsible. I find myself isolating myself and withdrawing from my family far more than I had done in the past.  I apologize for the writing in this post being all over the place, I am extremly emotional as I write this, reflecting on what has happened. He died on July 9th of this year and at the time of writing this I am still regretful, and I just don’t know how to progress past this point. I can’t stop thinking about him and how I failed him. I’ve been told continuously that I should forgive myself and try to move forward but no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to get past this weight on my shoulders. I’ve been trying to socialize more with my friends to keep myself out of the house and doing more productive things to help cope. I am writing this in hope of finding people who have had a similar experience of feeling overwhelming guilt and I want to know what you’ve done to cope and manage the feelings of numbness, regret, depression, and guilt. Words cannot even begin to describe how I feel. I find myself going through intense waves of guilt and feeling haunted by the loss of my family dog. Knowing that my family still loves me, and knowing that they don’t blame me and forgive me brings me little comfort, I cannot escape my thoughts lately. I want to atleast learn how to manage so I can get into a better mental health state. I can’t stop hearing his barks at night, and I would sob relentlessly but now I find myself being unable to cry and express my feelings. How do I manage grief? Is there any coping mechanisms That you would be willing to share? Do you have a similar experience? I Just need to know that I’m not alone I want to feel alive again, I want to forgive myself. Please tell me of anything that you can share that may help me.",1753782567.0,3,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc77fd/how_do_i_get_past_my_greif/,2025-07-29 09:49:27+00:00

1mce85d,Some words to my dad. I somehow finally can talk through it,"For depressants, just read my last paragraph.

""Dad, don’t ask why you have had insomnia for decades while your life, when awake, is already a nightmare? Maybe, the time when you try to sleep, is the peaceful part of your life, then you have to get up, continue to live the endless nightmare?""

Just had a talk to my dad when I realized, the biggest bully of my life is actually him. Over the time of my life, I realized I have come to accept all the words like 'You have a fking shit eyesight you will certainly be blind', 'You will have a hunchback for the rest of your life'... I am no longer afraid of whips, we got rid of them, and even if they were still here, I'm strong enough to fight back. I tried to forget the memories and learnt to obey. But now I still remember. Finally could talk to him that I'm not afraid that anything shit will happen with my life anymore, that I can happily die now, since it will both affect negatively on both him and me. I'm free from my thoughts now, never want to leave this world again. And I love you dad, no hate on you. I'm grateful for what you've done to me. All of them.

And fk listen you depressants, bc I just searched for this subreddit and already feeling bad reading all these posts. You are angry of someone?  
You just want to fking kill them? Or kind enough, just want them to fk off this world forever?  
DON'T SUICIDE  
YOU TORTURE YOURSELF AND THEY RECEIVE NONE  
IF YOU SUICIDE YOU LOSE IT ALL  
CONTINUE TO LIVE, LIVE FOR YOURSELF, IMPROVE YOUR OWN CONDITION  
and until you have the capability to basically do whatever you want, you are superior to them  
have a good talk (or maybe more, depends on you) then to all of your enemies  
craft your words, as sharp as possible, just like what they did to you  
you see them collapse, slowly, make them feel everything you have been through  
you have my cheer, you got this  
fuck them all  
  
Edit: for anyone who stills fucking want to suicide

I just wanted someone to want me. When i found that someone, i mistook their kindness as love. Soon realizing it was a fool's game, i was content with their friendship. But every waking hour is still spent in their memory. I try to set boundaries in my heart between us but cross them nonetheless. Now,even if they dont talk to me or ignore me the slightest, i just break down from within. Im jealous of the way they give their attention to others willingly while i have to beg for it.

1mc66aw,I don't understand why I feel this way,"I'm in my 4th year of Law school. I guess it's either the competitiveness, peer pressure or the toxic friend group that I was in from the very beginning that drained me. 

The fact that I'm writing this itself feels unreal to me. It's almost like I don't want to believe that I'm depressed. Or anxious. I get anxious to the point that it affects my speech patterns. My heart races to a point that I can't hear a word anyone's saying and I get nauseous. I'm done with people telling me I need professional help. I know I do. It's just that my parents are conventional minded when it comes to this. 

I don't even feel like going to college. The friend group I was in was weirdly competitive when it came to enrolling in extracurricular activities and they hung out behind my back...like I was shunned...like they didn't wanna be associated with me. And all along I thought I it's becuase I'm weird (Like who wants to associate themselves with a weirdo who's always depressed right?). That's the part that hurt me the most. The fact that I gave up on myself. More than anything else.

(Now I'm in a different friend group where my presence is appreciated and I feel like I'm valued and theirs is all in shambles). 

I don't know why it's hitting me now. My grades have took a huge plunge. I have attendance shortage and what not. 

As they say your environment influences how you behave. I grew up in an environment (My parents are generous and have a helping mentality)  where everyone are givers. My mum I felt like expects getting back atleast 1/10 th of what she gives. My dad is a chill guy tho 😂. As you can see, naturally I inherited their very characteristics. I used to think why they dedicate so much of their energy to people who dgaf about them. (Turns out they're both middle children 😭)

I used to hate their 'giving' mentality. But now...I've become the very thing I hate. And it's taken all my strength to accept the fact that it's not so bad to be a giver. To be like your parents. To not be like your parents. 

To be the side character who gets shuffled to the back of the crowd. To be the one clicks the pictures but never gets clicked. To be alone. To be together. 

I have no idea if people are gonna read this at all. I you did thanks a lot for sticking till the very end ❤️

1mcd2lr,It is normal to feel like this? Do I need to reach out?,"To preface, I've already spoken with my doctor about anxiety and depression, for which I was given resources and a temporary group on Mindfulness, which gave me some coping mechanisms, but the effectiveness for me seems to have plateaued.

For the past 2 years or so, especially ramping up over the past year, I've felt it incredibly difficult to feel anything. Most of the time.

I feel so disconnected from myself. I struggle to take care of my needs. I feel a complete apathy to my own wellbeing, I think at least partially because I find it hard to remind myself that I'm a person at all.

Everyone around me looks so vibrant. I feel lucid as an observer, but I find myself physically forgetting that I'm a person too.

My own name feels hollow. I find it practically impossible to imagine my future self. My memories of my past feel like I'm remembering a different person.

I have no will or drive to do things any more. I can't focus even on video games, movies, reading. The joy and passion that I used to have just feels absent.

Externally I do my best to stay optimistic, helpful, and seem functional. But I feel like it's nothing more than an act. A coping mechanism to keep myself alive.

Especially with the way the world is going, trans rights taking blows, freedom of information restricting. It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller. Like the world itself is starting to choke at my neck, and I can't breathe any more.

I know burnout and at least some levels of depression are ""common"" especially with younger generations. But I'm really fighting with the idea of maybe reaching out to try and get some help. But I'm not sure how much of this is in my head, and how much might require actual help.

After I while of waiting I check the water, well, it didn't filled, then I remember my bathtub never worked that well for the bathtub, so we always use the shower. I hoped for the water to not go, I even put my feet in the drain, it didn't work.

hur håller folk ens sig motiverade till att vilja va en ekorre åt någon annan? Det kanske inte känns så för dig...  
Men för mig känns det som att jag är en kossa om jag skulle välja att arbeta, i 08-17 världen.

det är också förståeligt att dom som har arbetat hårt, att komma upp till världen där dom kan anställa folk, att dom inte vill ha folk som är gnälliga och orutinerad och att dom inte kommer, ge belöning åt människor som är lata, det förstår ju vem som helst.

We’ve dated back in high school and rekindled. He helps keep me grounded and reminds me to stay present. He literally knows me in and out. I’m in the healthiest relationship I could ever imagined and he’s so understanding. 

But I always find myself finding comfort in my depression through music or sad things in general to get me in the mood. (Or I just crave it) I know it’s not healthy, but it feels like a security blanket. Odd I know.. I don’t stay in it for long, but a few days in it and I have to remind myself at times to bounce back and I feel better after. 😅. 

In our conversation: him “Do you thrive in depression?”  

Me “I do.. it’s like a drug that runs through my veins..
It has become part of me.”

And I know depression is a silent struggle and how lonely it can get. As humans we still crave human interactions and understanding.

There's no teachers/faculties, it's really poor and we can't afford private institutions so well....In that college we have to maintain attendance over 75% even though faculties will be absent more often than students and by faculty I mean guys sitting on examination shell & fee counter.  
I never got that attendance so they never gave me internal marks more than 40/50 it were like 30/50, 31/50, 26/50 and yes below 30, it's internal back for which I need to get least 34 marks out of 100 in externals and well I did not pass Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering in 1st year.  
I got 4 more backs in 2nd year but 3rd and 4th year I focused on progress and got no back although I cleared 2nd year's back.  
now I'm passed out last month, I finished final examination and attended back paper examination for Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering from 1st year and results are out.  
Of course I passed my all 4th year subjects maintaining CGPA over 6 but but but, guess what.

**I FAILED IN BOTH MATHS AND MECHANICAL AGAINNNN!**

Not like I didn't studied dude it's fucking 4th year and I'm poor, I'm stressed for job, I'm busy learning CSE skills for job, I'm busy studying subject I need to and why do I need to pass Basic-Mechanical-Engineering anyway for Software-Developer-Role?

*They gave me like 0.5 or 1 marks on 3-4 page 10 marks answer.*

I can't get degree without it, I'm afraid to tell my parents, I have job pressure already and now I'm depressed.

1mcaolw,Treatment resistant depression - trying auvelity now. Is it even worth it?,"I have literally tried every anti-depressant out there. I have been taking them since 2006! My psychiatrist decided to let me try Auvelity, since its new and different and yadda yadda. I'm a week in, and I feel something going on in the ol' noggin, but it's the first antidepressant to make me emotionally blunt. Weird. I feel slightly less depressed (I guess slightly is better than nothing?) but the lack of motivation, passion, and drive to just DO things make it worthless. I don't feel like doing... anything. I'm not sad, I'm just not excited. It's such a weird feeling.

Has anyone found that the emotional blunting eventually goes away? I want to keep going with Auvelity, but I have gotten almost nothing done these past 7 days and it has really put me behind.",1753793723.0,1,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcaolw/treatment_resistant_depression_trying_auvelity/,2025-07-29 12:55:23+00:00

just ignore me
like you always do
my painfull truth 

it is fine
i already drew the line
of when i sung
about me getting hung

leave me hanging
for i am nothing
but a random corpse 
in your mind

social suicide
emotional genocide 
none to abide 
with my attempt
to exist

for me
i only see 
the social
as the desert
Where the only
i see
are hallucinations 
of care

thank the life
for giving me
to the true world
where who care
has no presence.

thank you poetry 
for giving me fun
at the fine
to my misery

Really, no need to stay
I ask just do the sway
Plead to not show care
Minor sympathy nor empathy 
End for poor old me

1mc42pb,is there something inherently wrong with me,"16f. I've never really been much of an introvert (though I try to avoid going out when I can). I make friends pretty easily and I can talk to most people, yet I'm struggling in my relationships. Many of my friends in school have been actively leaving me out of activities and conversations. I feel like an accessory to most groups and my presence feels expendable. I don't get into drama, I don't talk shit about anyone I'm friends with, and I overcompensate by taking on their habits of speaking, humor, and interests so they can like me a bit more. As I went into high school, I molded myself to become more appealing to people and I made a lot of friends, yet all that effort feels ultimately futile. I don't belong anywhere I go, not since the day I was born. I'm the black sheep of my family (yes, even as an only child), the stain in my friend groups, and the one floater everybody goes to when their ""actual"" friends can be with them. I only have one really good friend, but she lives in a different state. Even then, she always talks about how close she is with her boyfriend and other best friends and I can't help but feel worse and even lonelier.

Even simple interactions with people are tiresome and trite. Every conversation I have with people feels like small talk. I don't enjoy anything. I try so hard, but I can't feel fulfilled by any conversation I have with them. It feels like time dilates, and I can feel my mind materialize and piece together huge rifts between me and everybody else. I'm missing something that makes them click--something that I don't have.

A lot of this has manifested into deep insecurities about my own faculties. I feel much less accomplished, talented, pretty, intelligent, witty, and charismatic than everybody else around me. I feel like a shell of a human being with no outstanding traits. I have my own interests, my own identity, and a good idea as my standing as a human being--yet I can't help but feel inadequate/emptier to everybody else. Talents I thought I had, and a vision for a future that I manifested for so long, seem to be slipping through my fingers like an inviscid liquid. I feel like nothing, I feel like I am a nobody. I can't achieve anything.

I don't like feeling this way. I don't know what to do. My therapist, my parents, and my best friend don't understand me and they don't give me any solutions or steps. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just a naturally a socially inept person? My mom and dad say I'm incredibly sarcastic wording on rude, but that's how a lot of my ""friends"" at school talk to me too. Or it is just my lack of admirable traits? I've noticed that all the more academically high achieving people and conventionally attractive people tend to accumulate friends very easily. My therapist, my friend, and my parents have all said that it's not my fault but if its happening within every social group I'm in, there has to be a common denominator, right?

I hate that I feel the way I do but I just can't help it anymore each and every day is a constant struggle a reminder that I longer want to be here. All I do is wake up at 4am go to work clock out go to the gym, eat a small meal, shower and sleep the same thing over and over again. I went out last Saturday with my friends for her birthday she wanted to see a DJ. So I went I was DD I didn't drink and while I was there in that room full of people pretending to have fun all I felt was empty and overwhelmed, exhausted like what am I even doing here I don't wanna be here. Everyday I wake and tell myself today is the day that I will do it but l never can find the will to actually go through with it. I cry myself to sleep till I am exhausted and can no longer cry. I think to myself of the various ways I can go about ending it. I could hop on my car and drive off to the middle of nowhere and hang myself obviously before I do that l'd break my phone so that no one can find me. I’m just exhausted a month ago I was drinking and my drink got spiked and I OD I was dead and the doctor resuscitated me. I I know should be happy that God gave me another chance, but I can’t help but feel mad because during that moment, it was like I was in some deep sleep. I was finally at peace. I was resting and now I’m back to this endless cycle that I call live.

1mc3txa,One of those nights,"
I feel like every other day I’m having like this weird reality check that this is my life. That I’m really a 24 year old with a dead mom and a father that’s never been in my life . Which at this point I truly don’t know even know if he’s alive. Like I can’t believe there is someone on this earth that I came from that wants nothing to do with me that I wouldn’t recognize if I passed by them, a complete stranger. It makes you wonder if my own father doesn’t even want me who would? Is this normal? was this something I was supposed to normalize and pretend like I can still have a good life . When I feel so isolated from literally every other human being. I feel so disconnected. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. When I’m working I feel responsible like an adult. When I’m distracted. When I have time to breathe I feel like a lost child. When I have time to take In my reality I’d rather be anywhere else than in my own body. I’m extremely delayed it’s like I’m always this 15 year old. No confidence , wanting to go unnoticed but be seen as “normal” embarrassed of my family dynamic. Never feeling like I’m valuable, likable enough. Then I get older and older and before I know it I’ll be 48 still feeling like that 15 year old. My mom died at 48 I hope I die sooner. I don’t have anything to do here but suffer. To be used and get nothing in return. Just feeling like the 15 year old that no wanted after mom died . Now I’m the 24 year old that people still don’t want. ",1753769390.0,3,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3txa/one_of_those_nights/,2025-07-29 06:09:50+00:00
1mc3pk0,Struggling rn,"I am a child abuse survivor. My parents had substance use issues as well as depressive tendencies. I was basically ignored or abused my whole childhood. I have adhd and didn't get the support I needed so I didn't do well in school. My older sister was the one they wanted.  

I basically planned to cut them out of my life since I was 6. I moved out, got my life together, managed to start a career and found a way to survive when I thought that would be impossible for someone like me. I'm married to a guy that treats me well and though our relationship isn't perfect, when we have problems he's on my team and willing to work on it with me. No kids, I didn't want any, then he didn't want any, now we're both considering it but circumstances and finances scare us. I spent a lot of my childhood lonely and friendless. But I even have friends now that I see every weekend.  

My grandpa passed and left me enough money to get a down payment on a house. A stable safe home was what I dreamed of having someday. It's what kept me pushing forward through all the hard times and academic bullshit. Interest rates are high but with our combined income we can make our mortgage payments. I work two jobs. Husbands job is really nice and pays for our health insurance.  

But it feels like something inside me broke once I got what I wanted more than anything in life. I have a house, but I'm not happy. I feel empty. Times are uncertain and I may get laid off, and in our city the major employer is letting people go. I've been trying to find a better job already so I don't have to work 2, but it's been a year, 3 interviews and nothing. I'm unsure if the skills I have are good enough now that there's ai. I'm so tired now. It makes me wonder what is the point? If this all wasn't enough for me, why am I trying so hard? Will I ever be happy?  

I can feel my therapist getting frustrated with me. She's seen me pull through worse stuff than this without feeling hopeless. But back then I had my dream home to look forward to someday at the end of it all. And I feel lost and directionless now that I have it and I feel less certain of my future than ever. I know I did all those things to get here. I should be resilient enough to survive whatever happens in life and I know that any life I make for myself could be a good one. But that part of me feels so far away. Like I can't be that anymore.
