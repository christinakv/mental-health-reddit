1mcxbe7,Just had the most amazing conversation with my gf,"Yall. Ok idk if this is a good place to put this. But I needed to just scream this to the world.

I have actively never wanted kids. Ever. Just feels like too much and wouldnt really work with my lifestyle.

But last night. I was with my wonderful girlfriend and we had just such a perfect date night. She took me to get my first tattoo, had some killer dinner, started to play a board game until things got hot and heavy real fast, took a shower at 4 am and I offered her a massage afterwards.

We were just there together. Watching a show and I was rubbing her legs and we were chatting.

Then she says ""do you ever want kids?"" 

I just stopped rubbing her and just froze. Because the answer to that question has always been a hard no. But life with her is so different than ive ever known with anyone and I see such a bright future for the first time in my life.

And after a second i teared up and just looked at her and said ""with you? Absolutely""

And i meant it. 

We just talked about it. In a healthy way. Imagining Christmases and birthdays for sure but also talking about adoption ages and when that would be a possibility for us career wise. 

Ive been thinking aboht it all day today. Its not a soon thing. Its not even a 5 years from now thing. But I love this woman yall. And the thought of just. Having a family? My own family? With her?

I lost years to depression. Years spanning into decades where I knew that life was passing me by. That I was wasting the one life I get.

But then the sun came out. The anhedonic haze lifted. My self-loathing hushed to a whisper‚Ä¶then gone. In their place, a warm energy. A youthful curiosity. Joy.

I find myself actively in the ‚Äúbest days of my life.‚Äù And I KNOW it. So I notice and savor.

And thank my lucky stars. Because indeed it does feel like providence. The change is just too monumental to seem natural. Yet it is my natural now.

I have arrived, and I am no longer letting anything pass me by!

1mb5409,"A Happy Marriage, how to be a green flag guy üòä","
Honestly, sometimes I just look at him and think, how did I end up with someone like this?

He‚Äôs so damn responsible it‚Äôs almost annoying ‚Äî like, who actually folds laundry immediately after it dries? Who keeps the fridge organized by category? Who remembers appointments without a reminder? My husband, apparently.

But it‚Äôs not just that. He‚Äôs so respectful, so thoughtful ‚Äî always checking in with me, listening, actually caring about how I feel. He never talks down to me, never tries to control anything. He treats me like an equal, like a partner, like someone he genuinely likes. And that hits different.

He‚Äôs not loud about it. He‚Äôs not flashy. But every little thing he does ‚Äî the way he handles stress, the way he quietly makes life easier for us, the way he treats people with kindness ‚Äî it just adds up.

And on top of that, he‚Äôs clean. Like clean clean. Like ""sanitizes his phone everytime he comes back from outside"" kind of clean.

He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ steady. Safe. Smart. Silly with me when I need it. Serious when it matters. He makes being loved feel peaceful.

Anyway, no special occasion. Just love the man a lot and wanted to put it out there into the universe. 

EDIT - Also because i have never seen anyone else being this thoughtful, for example - we both work from home, next to each other - he saw me being stressed because of too much work yesterday, he simply ordered my favourite biryani from my favourite place, he just knew it would make me happy, and when we were eating it, I asked him - why suddenly biryani? He said, I can't see you stressed for this long so I did what I could do while working. It just took him 5 minutes, but his thoughtfulness is unmatched. He is EXTREMELY EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT AND MATURED.",1753671474.0,184,28,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1mb5409/a_happy_marriage_how_to_be_a_green_flag_guy/,2025-07-28 02:57:54+00:00

1mb77pm,What‚Äôs the most thoughtful gift you‚Äôve ever received?,"Last year, I was going through a rough patch. Nothing catastrophic, just one of those stretches where everything feels a little off, work stress, bad sleep, that sort of thing. My birthday rolled around, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I didn‚Äôt even remind anyone because I honestly wasn‚Äôt in the mood to celebrate.

But my friend Sam showed up that evening with this oddly shaped box wrapped in brown paper. When I opened it, I burst out laughing, it was a custom-made ‚ÄúAnti-Burnout Kit.‚Äù Inside was a weighted eye mask, herbal tea, a candle labeled ‚Äúsmells like doing absolutely nothing,‚Äù and a journal with a cheeky title: Thoughts I Probably Won‚Äôt Finish Writing. Everything in it was tailored to me and ridiculously on point.

Turns out, she found most of it from small sellers on Alibaba. I always thought Alibaba was for bulk stuff, dropshippers or weird electronics, but she told me she just searched for ‚Äústress relief kits‚Äù and customized her order through a chat with the seller. Strange. The attention to detail made it feel super personal though, even though some parts came from across the world.
It wasn‚Äôt an expensive gift (so she claimed), but it was incredibly meaningful. It reminded me that thoughtful doesn‚Äôt mean flashy.
So now I‚Äôm curious, what‚Äôs the most thoughtful gift someone has ever given you? Or maybe one you gave someone else that really hit home? Could be small, silly, or sentimental, doesn‚Äôt matter. I just love hearing stories like that.",1753678204.0,30,12,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1mb77pm/whats_the_most_thoughtful_gift_youve_ever_received/,2025-07-28 04:50:04+00:00

1mb86vx,Do you ever feel like your room reflects your brain?,"I had this moment the other day where I looked around my room and thought, ‚ÄúYep, this is exactly how my brain feels.‚Äù Clothes in a semi-folded pile, three mugs on my desk, a half-burned candle I never light anymore, and a plant that‚Äôs somehow both dying and thriving. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm living in organized chaos, and it weirdly comforts me.
I started wondering if everyone else has these ‚Äúroom seasons.‚Äù You know, periods where your space feels calm and peaceful, and others where it‚Äôs like your inner world is spilling out onto the carpet. I go through phases, sometimes I Marie Kondo the hell out of everything, and other times I just let it be.

Funny thing: during one of my rare productivity spikes, I went on a mission to ‚Äúaestheticize‚Äù my desk. I saw this cool LED hexagon light panel online that people were using on TikTok. The official versions were insanely expensive, but I found a decent dupe on Alibaba that actually turned out really well.

1m8mkq1,i had an uncrustable for the first time.,"
i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. the way it melted in my mouth, the flavor of chocolate on my tongue. i had been staring at the treat since last friday, wanting to try it. i never got the chance to until today. i was hungry, and there was nothing to eat. i looked at the uncrustable in the fridge, and asked my grandma if i could have one. she said yes. i took the treat out of the box and put it in the toaster since it was frozen. i didn‚Äôt even wait for 60 seconds. i took it out. it was still a little cold, but i didn‚Äôt care. i put it on a plate and cut it in half, watching the chocolate in the bread with a smile on my face. i sat on the couch and ate it. even the crumbs. i licked the plate clean. it was staring at me earlier, begging for me to eat it, and when i did, all my troubles had disappeared. depression? gone. the trauma i had from the demon in my old house? gone. the trouble i have sleeping? gone. i was miserable, and the second i finally got my first taste of that chocolate uncrustable, i forgot who i was. i‚Äôm now a new person. 

i won‚Äôt forget about that little uncrustable that‚Äôs now in my tummy. the flavor is still on my tongue. tiny bits are on my teeth. i‚Äôm cleaning my teeth with my tongue. i still taste it. the flavor. the chocolate. the juices of joy from it all. now i need another, but my mom won‚Äôt let me have one. i have $55, and i was gonna save it to buy a laptop when my family and i move to ghana. forget that laptop, i‚Äôm gonna buy another uncrustable. i just need a cheap box. i‚Äôm gonna buy a box for my flight, maybe two. that way i can sit and watch netflix/youtube on my phone while on the flight. hopefully dollar general is selling one of them.

i remember seeing a chocolate uncrustable in middle school, but those were about ten dollars. i never had the money for it. i had forgotten about all that until today. the joy i feel right now is unforgettable.

I‚Äôd cry for the tiniest effort, and still be left empty-handed and we broke up . I still had some hope so I installed bumble. 

I met him (22M) there .I was on bumble for only 2 days. The moment I saw his profile and talked to him, something felt different. We exchanged socials and I deleted the app right away, and I was right, he is the one.

We‚Äôre in a long-distance relationship now, but I‚Äôve never been happier. He does the sweetest things without even making it a big deal. He listens, supports me, and infact He never let me ask . He does everything for me even before asking.Onetime I sent him a selfie with a capybara filter so he bought me a capybara plush üò≠. I told him I liked earrings and accessories but I don't have a collection so he bought me a collection . He always gets me something, never sends me away empty-handed.

One of my favorite things? I‚Äôm a Swiftie and once he saw a reel where a boyfriend gifts his girlfriend a chain with his initial. He remembered that and got me one from the same brand üíñ.

I made him paper roses. We talk even while he works and somehow, he manages to do both. We also have a little secret IG account where we post every cute date we‚Äôve had so far ü´∂

1m7ar1k,"I was suffering from awful mental health all year, but I finally feel like I have my life back in order!","This year has been a part of the worst period of my whole life, as stress from the Early College High School I go to and low self-esteem led me into serious depression. I have always been an all A's student, and I've always wanted to strive for something higher. Last year, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Scouting Program, and the year before that, I earned my Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. However, I never felt like it was enough, especially since it always felt like my mind would betray me at times and I would always look at the negative things I've done versus the positive things (I have ADHD). All of these accumulating bad thoughts mixed with the stress from the Early College I was talking about, mixed with loneliness and consistent rude comments by my peers led me to feel like my life was crashing down around March of this year. I would have occasional good episodes since then, but the majority of the March-July period was plagued with awful feelings and negative thoughts that I believe no human being should ever have to go through. I was almost certain I had developed depression or bipolar disorder (Most likely the latter, as it runs in the biological family). However, I feel like in the past week my life has flipped around and I finally have my life in order! I have started working at Sonic, which is just a bike ride away from my house, and I've started going to the gym, which has totally boosted my self-esteem. Compared to about 2 weeks ago, where I was still undergoing agonizing sadness and loneliness, now I feel struck with happiness and purpose. I was so scared not long ago, but now I feel more certain than ever about my future, and I am so grateful for the change in mindset that I could cry tears of joy right now!

1m6yeho,I had bought a stuffed animal for my sisters friend to help with her anxiety,"A few years ago, my sister's friend broke up with someone and she was upset. So, I let her borrow my weighted lavender plushie, and so I let her check out the website that the plushie came from. This sloth plushie was the last thing she was looking at, so I kept the link and was planning on buying it for her. But in the meantime, I crocheted a scarf for the regular plushie she already has and I put some calming essential oils on it. So then, I kept the link for years and never forgot about it. Then, when I finally had enough money, I bought the plushie and I asked my sister for her friend's favorite color. I got soft fluffy yarn in that color, then I crocheted a scarf for it. This plushie is weighted and has lavender in it too, and I put some lavender essential oil on the scarf to help. It hurt my hands to crochet it though, because I had to restart the project a few times and I'm not used to crocheting something that big. I also didn't see this when I bought it, but it said that it was baby blanket yarn. And I kept it in my room until my sister's friend came over again. And then, when I was finally able to give it to her, she was holding back tears of joy. And I told her all about the plushie, how it's microwavable, and can be put in the freezer too. And I suggested she check out the website for any other questions. And then, I also gave her a 3D printed baby wyvern, and she was happy and said that she was actually looking for something like that to put on her desk. And I even helped her sew up one of her comfort items that she keeps on her purse because it was old and had a bit of a rip in it.

1m6eyir,Just wanted to share something nice instead of venting all the time,"I never expected life to change this much in just a year and a half.
In 2024, I was with my then bf (now ex). I was supposed to get engaged to him in the next couple months, but due to some arguments that we had ( I believe I was valid bringing those arguments up with him considering I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with him), he dumped me. And I was in absolute shock because I was literally in the process of uprooting my life from my current country to his. And the job offers and pay there ain‚Äôt that great. But I was ready to let it all go and be with him. After that, I was sad, super upset and angry at him and myself. I hated life itself.
But SO much can happen in a year.
I cancelled the plans of moving, I graduated my Masters program in one of the top universities in the world, and I made so many friends. Finally, something I didn‚Äôt expect at all to happen was meeting my current man.
Who knew, within 4 months of breaking up with my ex, I‚Äôd meet this guy who would treat me like a queen? (Yes, he knew I had just broken up, I told him I didn‚Äôt want anything serious, neither did he. And that‚Äôs why the two of us decided to keep seeing each other)
As time passed, he turned out to be the most amazing person I‚Äôve met. He calls me out for my mistakes and helps me correct them, he adores me and my kinks, he trusts me and I trust him, we take turns cooking for each other, trying to make the other person as happy as possible (almost like a competition but in a healthy way).
And a year down the line, we‚Äôve fallen in love, and we are looking forward to moving in together. And this has to be the most amazing man I‚Äôve met. I hope he gets everything he wants and deserves.

1m619xr,My gay BFF is the best wingman ever he got me 2 boys numbers,"So I‚Äôm AD US military and just PCS‚Äôd to Japan. New experience, new environment, new culture, new everything. In my shop there is a gay man who I very quickly warmed up too. He‚Äôs always helping me out and I‚Äôve even been out with him and his husband to drink, have dinner, all that. 

He and his husband somehow always know ‚Äúwhere the party is‚Äù. I have never been to a big party due to the circumstances in which I was raised, so they invited me to come with them. I showed up to his place wearing a hoodie and shorts and he immediately goes ‚Äúbabe, what the hell am I looking at?‚Äù So I said this is what I‚Äôm wearing and he just goes ‚Äúno the hell you are not. Japanese people don‚Äôt do shorts and I‚Äôm not letting you wear a hoodie with anime boys on it in public.‚Äù

Random, but I‚Äôve never noticed how much gay people talk with their hands before this. It‚Äôs super funny.

He sits me down and just starts checking me out everywhere and says ‚Äúalright, I‚Äôm gonna fix you up.‚Äù He grabs a little kit to do my nails and starts doing my nails for me! He helps me with my hair and gives me a pair of black sweat pants. What happened next made me feel like I was in a movie because he starts dropping advice like he was a secret agent. 

‚ÄúAlright girlie, lesson one about men, they are all liars. They wanna sweep you off your feet with confidence and charming words, but that‚Äôs when you strike.

Lesson two, they loooovveeee attention. You give a man the slightest bit of attention and he will be all over you. Men love a girl who gives them attention.

Lesson three, don‚Äôt be hard to catch but don‚Äôt be free either. Find that middle ground, be a little mysterious, but don‚Äôt be so blunt or evasive.‚Äù

Then he does a complete 180 and starts toasting tf out of me üò≠

‚ÄúSo, we got some pros and cons here. Pros, you have a very pretty face and your body is beautiful. Cons, all four of your tires are flat which some men may not like.‚Äù

Like, the sudden kick to the face was unexpected but I thought it was funny üò≠.

Anyway, when he‚Äôs all done with me, I look in the mirror, and I was amazed! I took so many pictures because I loved the look. My nails looked good and matched my outfit, he made me wear these fake circle frame glasses (I wear contacts normally but have square frame backups), and my hair looked so good.

1m5pjw0,What is this guy made out of.. crack? I have literally never been so attracted to someone before,"It is a total 180¬∞ from any other relationship I‚Äôve ever had, and we aren‚Äôt even in an official relationship. My last ex was abusive and tore me down every chance he got. I thought I would never even experience dating someone who actually cares about me. 

And It‚Äôs so weird, how slow we have taken things. I actually met this guy 6 months before leaving my ex. Plenty of sexual tension and flirting but of course I wasn‚Äôt going to act on it until I could do so without guilt. And to be honest, because I knew he was a bit of a player, I was only expecting a 1 night stand or casual sex, nothing beyond that. But why is he SO NICE???? It definitely was casual at first, but things started changing. It‚Äôs been since about mid April.. so about 4 months. Longer eye contact, I can see the look in his eyes has changed. Random phone calls that last for 2 hours. Taking me to concerts of screamo/post hardcore bands that he literally has never heard of and he doesn‚Äôt even listen to metal, much less the 2010 emo stuff which is what I listen to lol. 

Someone broke into my car and smashed the window in the process, and he called the shops, scheduled a time, went with me, took me to lunch, paid for the window, then was on the phone with me the whole way home. I was just like ‚Äúüò≤‚Äù the whole time internally. Baffled. Dude, if I was with my ex he‚Äôd literally tell me it‚Äôs my fault because I was at a bar and tell me to figure it out. Then today, he sends me a picture of a new bar key that he had custom made??? I thought it was a mock-up of one or something, like a product picture. No, he ordered one. Has my name and ‚Äúbiggest OPP‚Äù which is a funny nickname we call each other lol. I had said a few weeks ago that I‚Äôd have to get a new bar key soon because the coating on mine was starting to peel; I‚Äôm a bartender so I need it daily lol. Again, ‚Äúü§Ø‚Äù is my reaction. Like‚Ä¶ hello? None of my exes have ever even gotten me a birthday gift or done anything this nice.. ever. And this was just random he didn‚Äôt even say anything until it was delivered. My ex literally called me trashy every day for being a bartender. 

And I won‚Äôt go into too much detail here I guess, but the sex? HELLO? It is very good 10/10 would recommend. 

Anyways.. that‚Äôs the tea so far. And we are riding this fine line, at this point it feels like someone just has to break first. But it‚Äôs so fun and I love the tension. The looks and smiles, dude. The change in tone and demeanor. I feel like I have a high school crush again üòÇ ",1753119657.0,100,8,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1m5pjw0/what_is_this_guy_made_out_of_crack_i_have/,2025-07-21 17:40:57+00:00

1m3q05o,"Today I drove from LA to SF, something I always wanted to do","I've been having a rough time lately in a lot of ways, and long story short it culminated in having to throw all my stuff in my car and drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco to stay with a friend. I always loved California and was so excited to finally be able to move here, and it was a huge relief that my friend was able to help me stay in the state. Pretty much as soon as I headed up Ventura Highway I started grinning and all my troubles melted away.

The coastline was amazingly beautiful. I was driving on a road that was right next to the clear blue water, with steep cliffs and mountains flanking me on the other side. There were all sorts of beach houses surrounded by palm trees and little shacks, boardwalks, small islands and boats. Then my GPS took me up into the mountains and I was driving through a national park with sparse old winding trees and flowers everywhere, and a huge mountain range in the backdrop. I drove past ranches and reservations in the desert, and there were little fruit stands with rainbow umbrellas on the side of the road.

Eventually I took a detour for lunch at the Madonna Inn, which was something right out of a fairy tale. Someone built a massive, whimsical pink and white cottage surrounded by ornate fountains and flowers. The inside was filled with intricate carved wooden frames, copper, stained glass and brightly colored fabrics. I had a cup of coffee that was so perfect it didn't need milk or sugar, and the soup was delightful. I walked around the building and the various gift shops for a while before getting back on the road.

The next stretch was more inland and mostly desert and farmland, so I flew down the open road listening to music and podcasts. Eventually the trees started to look darker, taller and closer together. Clouds covered the sky and the temperature dropped from 100 to 65, so I knew I had to be getting into northern CA.

1m3ab2j,I snuck a dog into a care home today and made about ~15 people super happy,"A patient in a place I trained before finishing my education requested to meet my dog while I was still there. I wasn't able to at the time but promised I'd bring her at SOME point. Some point was last week - but after I found out the looooong trail of paperwork I'd have to deal with (the process is meant for regular visits and includes submitting photos of the dog and a physical ID card for the animal, not suitable for a one time visit at ALL) I decided to just do a low stakes reverse heist and sneak in with her today. 

To be clear, it's an organisational issue, not at ALL hygiene etc, in case that's a concern, dogs ARE allowed and I'm well familiar with the rules. The only consequences would have been a scolding and being asked to leave, maybe not even that - nothing serious. 

On my way to the patient I wanted to see I spotted another one I knew liked dogs, so I stopped by his room and let him pet her also, asked him not to rat me out. Located the patient I specifically wanted to see - she pet my dog, I asked her not to snitch. On the way out, I met two more I knew and let them pet the dog also, told them not to tell anyone. 

I was spotted at this point by a super nice former colleague, who, instead of ratting me out, joined the heist and suggested some of his patients who liked dogs also, so we continued on his floor. Each of the patients promised not to tell and pet/fed my dog. 

I spent about 3-4 hours sneaking a 5kg dog in a backpack through a medical facility so some 15+ patients could pet a dog (for many of them, the first in many years). It was incredibly fun for me and felt like a child sneaking around, and a loooot of people got to fulfil their wish of petting a dog again! I was offered a red bull and some ice cream as a 'bribe' for being allowed to give my dog her treats etc. Everyone was super invested in my 'crime'.

1m2bxbh,"serendipity, second chances, and personal growth","I don't believe in soul mates or in fate. I believe that the universe is indifferent to the romantic tanglings of our species - it neither helps nor hinders us. 

I do, however, believe in serendipity. 

Simply put serendipity is a happy little accident. 

I wasn't fated by the gods to meet my bf because there are no gods. The universe didn't conspire to unite us. But a series of happy accidents brought us closer and closer, time and time again. Growing up near each other during highschool, the same bars in college, he lived in the same area as my parents in Arizona, and then after everything, we ended up living an hour and a half apart.

When we met on Twitter we originally bonded over parenting stuff and cannabis. We talked to each other all the time and even met IRL once for a short hike at Snoqualmie Falls. Then, a few months later, we had a huge falling out and stopped talking for more than two years. 

Our digital paths crossed again in January '24. The algorithm put me on his timeline and he decided to risk my wrath and DM'd me. It only took a few weeks for us to fall back into our old conversation patterns. Friends became FWBs became bf/gf and now, a year and a half later, we're cohabitating. 

If we had tried a relationship together 5 or 10 years ago, it would have been doomed from the start. We both had to go through some serious character development before we were in a place where ""us"" was even a possibility. 

I spent twenty years in a marriage devoid of passion. Twenty years making myself smaller to fit the role of wife. Twenty years muting the parts of me that made me who I was to meet my ex's standards. 

I got out of that marriage and I put in the work to get to know myself and to heal the traumas that shaped decades of my life and all of my most important relationships. I learned how to set boundaries and to stick to them. I learned to identify my triggers, to choose my battles, and to walk away from situations and relationships that no longer serve my peace or best interests. I spent a year sorting out myself out (both in and out of therapy) and, for the first time in my adult life, I genuinely love who I am and what my life is like now. 

I spent my first 40 years figuring myself out, unlearning thought patterns and pushing back against generational trauma cycles. Now I plan to spend whatever years I have left doing what makes me happy with the people I love. 

I'm grateful for the happy little accidents (and even the not-so-happy ones) that eventually led me here. I'm grateful for a love that doesn't include jealousy or anger resentment. I'm grateful that I didn't settle for a life that wasn't enough for me. I'm grateful for second chances and starting over.

He and I thought we needed seatbelts! These chairs THREW YOU! It was insane!

I felt bad, during the actual movie there was a tense scene, but I was laughing like crazy as the seats were going wild, water was being thrown in our faces, it was just insane! I couldn't not laugh! As for the movie, it is so hard as I feel I may be biased due to the experience, but it was great! It kinda slowed down a lot near the beginning, but there were some genuinely scary scenes, and watching it in 4D made it so much more intense! Then after I treated us to Five Guys, least where I am in England it isn't super common, he's been going on about it for ages, I've only had it once, so I thought it'd be a nice meal. My brother seemed to enjoy it all too which was nice! Just, yeah, awesome day! First time I have felt genuinely happy in a while!

I should add, not to make this silver linings, but I don't have a great relationship with my family, and I was the strict and grumpy one to my brother, no one ever gave him boundaries or told him off and I could see it causing issues, so I took on that roll. I was always scared he wouldn't like me when he got older, so doing things like this with him, it means more to me than I can say",1752574520.0,508,25,happy,https://i.redd.it/sotjnwcuj0df1.jpeg,2025-07-15 10:15:20+00:00

1m0rzyp,"After making a joke to my boyfriend about wanting to get engaged in 3 years, he said he was thinking more along the lines of 2","I‚Äôm not sure how it came about, but I was with him on the phone and we were joking around. I just started a work situation which will remove me from my home country to another for two months at a time, every couple months. This was the first two months, and I was a bit worried about our relationship. However, it all went perfectly. I was not worried at all, even though I struggle with intense anxiety. We didn‚Äôt text much or feel the need to constantly talk, but sometimes when I grabbed my phone to text him that I missed him, I would see he had texted me the same just minutes before. I‚Äôm happy to have time to focus on myself, but also miss him dearly. 

Anyway, I was joking about this ‚Äútimeline‚Äù I have for my life which would include getting engaged and/or married in my late twenties, and how I told my friend that ‚Äúif he doesn‚Äôt change drastically, I wanna get engaged to him in 3 years‚Äù and he immediately went ‚Äúoh, I told my friend more like in 2 years‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Our relationship is still quite fresh, so this engagement estimate might or might not happen; and in any case the wedding would not immediately follow. But, not so long ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship that I still fight the effects of. I thought my life was forever changed, and that it would take me ages to find happiness again, and that I‚Äôd never be ready to trust someone again. As I said it‚Äôs fresh, so the honeymoon feelings are still very real, but I‚Äôve never felt so safe and cared for in any other relationship, at any time in it. He just doesn‚Äôt give me anything to stress or worry about. We resolve our conflicts very well, and he honestly inspires me to become a better person, which I‚Äôve also never felt before. I‚Äôm making leaps and bounds in therapy and combatting the lasting effects of being in an abusive situation such as PTSD, anxiety, and anger. He‚Äôs just so nice to me that it makes me want to be nothing but nice and caring back! And I don‚Äôt have to be the bigger person at all, it‚Äôs simply what he deserves for how he treats me and everyone else in his life.

After being in an abusive situation; it feels impossible to trust again, but he proves to me time and time again that he appreciates me as I appreciate him, and that I am not being duped again, and that he does really care for me. I always like when he tells me he talks about me to his friends, but the fact that he‚Äôs talking about possibly proposing to me made me feel so unbelievably fuzzy. We‚Äôre both young, it might not happen that way, but the fact that he wants to right now and is voicing that makes me so happy. It‚Äôs also nice because I‚Äôve known I wanted to get married eventually for a while, but could not imagine any of my exes at the end of the isle, for some reason? It just felt out of place, or unrealistic, or it just didn‚Äôt make sense as an image. 
I can imagine him clear as day though, and think about it sometimes.

Our coach today said this weeks materials are for me. He had us do strikes from traditional martial arts that are normally not in kickboxing.  He told us why they are useful to know.

It‚Äôs like something clicked in my head that nothing is that serious which of course I always knew but I could never get myself to believe it or feel it. No amount of trying to figure it out worked. Idk if my frontal lobe developed or my hormones balanced or what it was but it‚Äôs like the chemicals that made me feel horrible for no reason at all just decided to let me loose.

I feel so lucky and clear headed for the first time in a long time and I‚Äôm simultaneously at peace with where I am and I don‚Äôt want to take the life I live for granted. I feel joyful even when I‚Äôm not happy. Anyways, huge deal for me, never give up because you might just wake up one day and feel so glad you‚Äôre still here. <3",1752165335.0,25,3,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1lwhc1v/i_think_my_mental_state_is_the_best_its_been_in/,2025-07-10 16:35:35+00:00

1lvzegy,Ok I finally got my first year of happiness since being born in 1969. It‚Äôs not perfect but I‚Äôll take it.,"I noticed something last week and it‚Äôs actually a really big deal for me. It‚Äôs the closing of a 40-year circle.

In my teens, I signed an agreement with ‚Ä¶ whatever. In reality, with myself. The deal was that if I could get one year of happiness, I would fight through to get it.

It just happened. ECT (electroshock therapy) took effect May 2024 and it‚Äôs been a full year without miserable pain ever since. That kinda hit me last week.

Because this year has sucked and still does. But sitting homeless in a field with a left foot with no skin was actually the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. It‚Äôs been the best year of my life.

So the agreement has in fact been fulfilled. I was hoping for better but yes, that‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll go quiet though i‚Äôd really prefer not to right now if it‚Äôs just the same. But this is all bonus time from here.",1752108514.0,158,15,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1lvzegy/ok_i_finally_got_my_first_year_of_happiness_since/,2025-07-10 00:48:34+00:00

1lv4ynn,She loves it! My first commission honoring the life of someone's mom,"(Pictures begin as finished piece; progress pics; initial concept.) 

One of the nicest people ever reached out to me here on Reddit and asked if I was open to painting an abstract piece to honor her mom who she recently lost. Her mother's interests were Nature and the stars. She graciously shared the euology she had written so I could better understand who her mom was as a person and as a parent. It was an honor but also intimidating because I had never done a piece specifically to represent someone or their personality (especially someone I'd never met). 

She specified the colors but beyond that it was pretty much up to me (well, up to my subconscious brain) to figure out how to symbolize her mom and the relationship they shared. What emerged is the imagery you see that revealed itself in stages of development over time. The two branches represent her mom and her, and are parallel to represent the fact that although they can never physically touch, they are always close; that a part of the person we have lost is always near to us in feeling, in memory, in effect (even in dreams). The piece is called ""You are With Me in My Dreams."" 

The left branch (representing her mom) turns away to symbolize the abrupt change in life course. The colors and stars were requested so the painting becomes more blue/green and more filled with stars as it develops. The final picture is how we decided to leave it and  thankfully she loved it. I could breathe a sigh of relief! It was emotional to paint and I listened to music to enter flow consciousness and keep going to ensure it would be an image that would genuinely remind her of the relationship they shared for so many years. 

It was quite the experience and thankfully she is thrilled (which was a major relief especially because a part of me was anxious/nervous, wondering if I could pull this off! Commissions can be tricky since they are so ambiguous). 

Anyway, thank you for reading and have a great week! ‚ú®Ô∏èüôè‚ú®Ô∏è",1752020767.0,1562,101,happy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv4ynn,2025-07-09 00:26:07+00:00
1lvwyeg,My friends are just the best people on this planet,"So, this is gonna be short and sweet because I need to wake up in five hours to take a plane, but some days my heart is just so full of happiness that it feels like it's going to explode.
I struggled with feeling inadequate and lonely for my whole life, with some periods in between in which I had friends but like... Well not here for ranting, let's just say, not the best.

Then I met my partner, who is an amazing man, and I thought I wasn't lonely anymore... Turns out I was, because I still needed friends. And yes, I would often meet my partner's friends, and they were nice, but...
And then something happened. Something changed. And now two of his friends (his best friend and his partner) are my friends too. And I wish I could just tell you how they make me feel... They make me feel loved, seen, they are sincerely so happy to see me, and they make me feel secure in my feelings for them, so confident that I actually tell them all the time that I love them. Because I know they love me too. And they're so sweet and smart and gentle. We even hugged a few days ago, they know physical touch can be a lot for me so she asked me ""So... Are we doing hugs now?"", and when I said yes they both hugged me and it was so fucking sweet, like her eyes were shining as if she had been waiting for that for ages, and his hug was so gentle.

And yes, this post is definitely not short and probably doesn't make sense because I'm very sleepy, but let me just shout it from the rooftop: S. and O., I love you, you're my best friends and my favourite people in the whole universe, together with my partner. I love you, and I admire you, you have two beautiful souls, and I'm so proud of myself for working on my traumas and being able to have a healthy friendship. So good night everyone, I'm leaving for Paris in a few hours, where I'll send my friends pictures of my holiday, as they specifically asked.

And always remember: things do get better. And I wish you could all find your own O. and S.",1752101703.0,19,2,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1lvwyeg/my_friends_are_just_the_best_people_on_this_planet/,2025-07-09 22:55:03+00:00

1lshcny,"I never had kids, it just wasn't in the cards for me.","Buckle up buckaroo, this is a long one.

I never had kids. It was just wasn't in the cards for me. In my mid 30's I met someone I really liked and we started hanging out. I didn't know much about her, and by the time I figured it all out it was way too late. She was an addict. She had 3 teenaged girls. All 3 were in foster care. All 3, aged 12 14 and 16, were already on meth.

The next decade of my life was a living hell. She fell further and further into addiction. Dragging my life with her. She was abusive as hell when she started jonesing. She'd disappear for weeks at a time. Usually pop up after getting arrested. By the time it was over she was deeper than ever. My home was destroyed. My savings were gone. I had a record from defending myself from her. But in all that time I made sure those girls were looked after. That they had somewhere safe to call home. That they got clean.

I've been single for about 3 years now. She left me for the plug. She's in jail again. Looking at prison this time. Took me 6 months free to realize I had been a battered husband. Don't worry, I'm still cleaning up the mess, but I'm doing good now days. Mostly because my girls stuck by my side. Invited me over for events, let me babysit the grandkids. Put in the work to make sure I had a place in their lives.

Well, this year they decided they were in charge of the 4th. Got all the fireworks, organized a who brings what list for the cookout. It was great. It was them, their significant others, the kids(the middle has twin boys and a babygirl that are my world) and the parents of the oldest's bf because they were hosting at their house. Or so I thought. As soon as we show up the youngest announced she is two months pregnant. The kids are getting a cousin! It was a great start to a great night. The food was awesome, the music never stopped, neither did the kids, and once they got started the fireworks didn't either. The oldest's bf was on fuse duty all night because that guy truly loves to blow shit up. There was a moment of excitement when one of the mortars exploded too close to the ground that sent us fleeing, screaming, and laughing. He did a great job. He let her pick out the finale. One of those big 100 shot boxes and he drug her over to light it. Now, apparently this part was an impromptu addition by her sister who showed perfect timing and taste with it, but as soon as the fuse sparked Marry You by Bruno Mars started playing and he dropped to one knee.

She said yes as a wall of rainbow flames erupted behind them. Hell, it was the most magical moment of MY life and I was just an observer. The only dark spot was the fact their mother wasn't able to be there, and I truly hope missing it will be the wake up call she needs to face her demons.

I don‚Äôt think I believed in this kind of connection before him. Not like this. But then he showed up. My smart, hilarious, beautiful smile, (with the absolute worst music taste) handsome man. 

He does these cute, random little things I can‚Äôt even explain. The kind of things that make me stop and smile to myself like an idiot. They‚Äôre so small, but so him. 

I‚Äôm so happy for the person he‚Äôs become. Strong, grounded, and confident. Watching him become more of himself has been one of the most beautiful parts of this year.

1lsjh38,Someone I started working with a couple of months ago for increasingly debilitating health issues suggested my husband and I take a metabolism test to see how well our metabolism is functioning. I'm so happy that his is shockingly good for a man his age (72).,"My health stuff is way too long and negative a story to go into, suffice it to say I started having symptoms as a young child, and after years of accumulating a nice list of autoimmune diagnoses was finally able to get an overall *immune* diagnosis about three years ago when I was 65.

Since then I've tried to find someone who could do more than just tell me to try various supplements and medications from the protocol for treating the symptoms of that illness, but who could actually identify why my body reacts to any and all of those things; in other words what else has been going on underneath that that I haven't been able to get to step one of treatment for it?

Then a few months ago a friend referred me to an epigeneticist who has gone over my DNA test results, other tests that had previously been done including heavy metal toxicity and mycotoxicity, took an extensive physical, emotional and mental health history, and ordered a methylation panel and that one for metabolism.

It turns out that going into all that detail shows that I'm pretty much a mess, *but I now have someone who now knows exactly what I need to do to start getting better!*

Thankfully my husband also got on board and decided it might be a good idea to find out if there's anything he should be addressing now, to make sure he stays as healthy as possible for as long as possible, and of course he was thrilled with his results. (He apparently only needs one multivitamin that should take care of his only health complaint.)

1ls2f6j,Watermelon Girl (the sequel) : A Year in review,"Nearly a year ago I made a nickname for my reddit friend and created a post about her. I knew I enjoyed talking to her, felt a connection I had been missing for years. It felt like the start of a good friendship. Little did I know what I was in for. That she would end up being such a crucial part of my days and well, in my life.

So as a gesture of everything she means to me, and well because we are just 2 cheesy people. I decided to look back on our amazing year.

It has gone by in an instant yet, somehow, you have made it feel as though its also a lifetime. Whether we were being silly and laughing at one another (especially with your perfectly timed ""typos""), having deep and tough conversations about life, or sending each other songs (I still have the superior taste in music btw) every minute with you felt so meaningful and effortless. Next thing we knew months had passed. It flew by like the blink of an eye, yet now I feel like I have known you my entire life.

Your kindness. I know I say it often but you have such a kind heart. Often putting others needs before your own just to not let them down. You are so modest and respectful and make me want to be better. You always have patience for me. Fill my life with positivity and save me from my terrible moods. How someone can always be so sweet is just unbelievable to me. You are one of a kind.

Your beauty. Bet you cringed reading that because you hate when I mention it. But you are stunning. Your mess morning hair, your dark cherry red lipstick, your favorite spooky Halloween pajama pants, and well everything else I could not mention here. I am a luck guy, and I will always feel that way.

Your support. The way you have been there for me through my lowest moments. Brought my back from dark places. Given me such confidence to believe in myself and be the best version of me. Overall just make me feel like a wonderful deserving person. Its indescribable but I guess....that's love.

I wish I could hand you the world on a platter, though you would be too modest to accept it. I know we met by the most random of chances, its Reddit after all, but I just know our paths were meant to cross. Even then, I often find my own self wondering what I did to deserve you.

So Watermelon Girl, cheers to one year of our journey. I look forward to many more. I still can't believe how lucky I am. It is all dawning on me know...this is the real thing.",1751693343.0,3,3,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1ls2f6j/watermelon_girl_the_sequel_a_year_in_review/,2025-07-05 05:29:03+00:00

1lr7nbh,Finally feeling safe to be taken care of,"I had a really humbling knee injury a few days ago. A few weeks prior I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with a minor meniscus tear and told I should be ok just wearing a brace for a bit.

Being the impatient person I am, the second I started to feel better and more stable on that knee I tossed the brace in a drawer. Everything was fine until a few after my 41st birthday I am walking from my office to the bathroom and my knee gives out with an audible pop loud enough a person standing near me heard it and caught me before I dropped.

The college kids manning the storefront I run? Got me to my car. Reached out to my peers to arrange coverage. My bosses (all offsite) reached out to check in and make sure I understood I wasn‚Äôt to be at work until I was cleared. The kids have been sending me silly memes and making sure i know they‚Äôre keeping things up. My peers are offering to bring food over, run me places if I can‚Äôt drive myself.

My husband and son have coordinated between themselves looking after me, and taking care of things I would normally. I need help with some pretty basic things right now and am possibly facing surgery and my family is just reminding me that this is what family does. And all these things may sound like a given, but they‚Äôve never felt like a given to me before in my life. I‚Äôve been genuinely overwhelmed with feeling loved and supported at work and at home.

1llyrky,"My mom just finished her last shift as a nurse after 35 years, we surprised her with a backyard celebration","Today is one of those days I‚Äôll remember forever.

My mom has been a nurse for 35 years, through night shifts, snowstorms, pandemics, and everything in between. She‚Äôs always put others before herself, even when it meant missing holidays or barely sleeping. Growing up, I saw her come home exhausted but still smiling when she‚Äôd talk about holding someone‚Äôs hand through a hard moment or making a kid laugh during a scary procedure.

This morning was her last shift. My siblings and I secretly planned a backyard surprise party with her closest friends, family, and even a few coworkers who could make it. We decorated with fairy lights and old photos from her nursing school days. When she walked in and saw everyone, she started crying, not from sadness, but (as she put it) from ""the kind of joy that fills your whole chest.""

It was simple, nothing flashy. Just a lot of people she‚Äôs helped or inspired, coming together to remind her how much she‚Äôs loved.

She‚Äôs spent her life helping others feel better. Today, we got to give a little bit of that back to her.",1751042832.0,295,8,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1llyrky/my_mom_just_finished_her_last_shift_as_a_nurse/,2025-06-27 16:47:12+00:00

1lm32c1,My Grandfather's 95th Birthday Surprise.,"Today was one of the happiest days of my life. My family and I threw a surprise 95th birthday party for my grandfather, and it was absolutely magical.

We decorated the backyard with photos of his life, his wedding day, his days as a young dad, his army uniform, and even some hilarious pictures of him with his old 1970s mustache. We had his favorite meal (lasagna and garlic bread!) catered, and even arranged for a local jazz band to play because he loves jazz.

The moment he walked into the backyard, his face lit up brighter than the sun. He was speechless for a few seconds and then exclaimed, ‚ÄúYou all got me this time!‚Äù His laugh is contagious, and soon everyone was smiling ear to ear.

The best part? My little cousin handed him a scrapbook we made, filled with handwritten letters and drawings from the whole family. He teared up while reading it and hugged every single one of us, saying, ""This is the best day of my life.""

Seeing him so full of joy reminded me how important it is to cherish our loved ones. Moments like this make everything worthwhile.

1lickqj,"I've been rediscovering my passion for cooking! Also tried a bunch of new foods, which is great as a fussy eater!","I used to really be into cooking and baking, and two things that made me happy were firstly, I was self taught, I just started it one day and relied on constructive criticism to get better, and people loved my food whenever they ate it. Secondly, yeah, I loved making food for others, so many times I never actually ate my own food, what made me happy was seeing how happy my food made others, and how much they enjoyed it, I didn't care for eating it myself

Then when I sorta lost everyone, I lost my love for food, I lost the reason I enjoyed making food. I fell into a really bad pit of just having frozen chips and frozen chicken pretty much every day, that's all I ended up eating. But the past 2 weeks I finally properly started on the diet side of things and have (mostly) stuck to the plan, and every single meal for the past 2 weeks has been something fresh, and something different. I've ate so many foods that are new to me, as a fussy eater that's huge in its own right, but yeah, I've been eating homemade foods using fresh ingredients again!

Although it is different, I've really enjoyed these past 2 weeks. I actually look forward to eating again, food is exciting again, I keep thinking about my meals and how I will prepare them, I've really enjoyed working with flavours and finding the balances again and using seasonings, to have that experience of just putting on music and getting in the zone, it feels like I'm discovering that home in the kitchen again. With all this gym stuff, the physical changes are great, I'm constantly looking at my body and comparing it to last year, and feeling proud of all my hard work and achievements by doing this all naturally.

1lh1om7,Finally talked to my crush after 10 years of pinning!!,"So I've been living in my hometown for more than 10 years, and she lives 3-4 houses down from mine. She's literally so pretty, cute, and adorable. From the very beginning, by the way, she's older than me, maybe 5 years older. I've always been a shy guy, never really around my home, but I was into outdoor games a lot from my childhood. I would always see her sometimes. Man, I have no words to explain what's been happening since last week. I've always been into her, and even she tried a long time ago to chat with me (because I'm a very academic guy). She would always find me reading books outside my home in the early morning, so she might have wanted to connect, but I never approached her. Since then, she stopped giving me attention, or so I thought. So last week, I played a game called ""lagori"" with a group of girls and little boys. She always plays with them, but this was my first time.  And luckily, she was on my team!  So I gathered my courage and talked to her that day‚Äînot much, just about the game. That was that evening. Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention: Every day after dinner, I go outside, and she does the same. I've crossed paths with her countless times but never talked to her. But a few days ago, after the game we played, I asked her, ""Zal kay jevan?"" (Have you eaten dinner?).  She was surprisingly shocked that I talked to her! She was like, ""Me?"" She smiled and said, ""Yes, and you?"" You won't believe it; I couldn't stop blushing and smiling. Man, her smile, the way her dimples appeared on her cheeks, her eyes, and her long, silky hair... I wasn't prepared for it. ü´† Then, today, we talked! It was all planned, and I had prepared, but my script didn't work out.  But I finally talked with her for 10 minutes and had a good time talking about my internship, interviews, and my skills as a freelancer. She was very impressed, saying I was amazing and great. She also shared about herself and everything. I'm so happy today that I don't think I'll get any sleep tonight! Wow, she's beautiful! üòç

Guys, please give me some suggestions on how I can keep this going every day?

TLDR: After 10 years of silent pining, I finally talked to my beautiful neighbor! We played lagori, I asked her if she'd eaten dinner, and today we had a 10-minute conversation!

After getting home, he sets up a nest of pillows for me on the couch, helps me lay down, covers me in blankets and makes me nice and comfy. Gets me anything I ask for, helps if I need to get up, gets me lunch and dinner and just spends the day with me to make sure I'm okay.

1lfhxdx,Today I 'cut off' a toxic friend of 13 years and I feel so much better.,"
Today I 'cut off' a toxic friend of 13 years and I've never done so before. I blocked them on all platforms so they cannot contact me. I was emotionally dependent on this toxic person on and off for many years. I have also been very toxic and I am not at all blameless, either. But in the past I always excused them being emotionally abusive to me. They've bullied me and have gaslighted me for many years. Whether they have enough self awareness of them being abusive to me is debatable. But it doesn't matter...I refuse to lay down and be beaten like I have been for years. This is a big step for me as even a couple years ago the thought of me cutting someone off was inconceivable. I never understood how people could just cut people off but now I finally understand. I feel really good right now for finally taking action. I had a very traumatic childhood, so I think until recently I perceived being abused as normal but I know now that it's abnormal and wrong. I feel so much better now for finally doing something and standing up for myself and truly believing in myself. I've always seen myself as ""less than"" and not worthy. I've always viewed myself as not human. Today I see myself for who I am- I deserve to be loved and not hated. I deserve to be happy. All the while being cognizant of my own toxicity and faults but moving on learning from them instead of wasting away in my own misery. And most of all I am finally comfortable with being alone and being my OWN best friend.

1lem6y9,"Today, 7 years later, I found my deceased mom's wedding ring.","
Since 2018 I have lived with the guilt and shame of thinking I accidentally sold my deceased mother's wedding ring in a garage sale. 

I had three jobs, three kids, and was the main caretaker of my grandmother that lived nextdoor and was developing dementia. We woke up late before the garage sale and early on a guy offered me $10 bucks for a box full of what I thought was costume jewelry with a few nicer but older ugly pieces but nothing with much value.

About a month later my oldest was graduating high school. I went to put my mom's ring on as a tribute to her not being at the event. I couldn't find the ring. After the graduation and for the next several weeks I tore the house apart. I thought I had looked everywhere. I then decided what must have happened was it accidentally ended up in jewelry box I sold. I was devastated.

Today I found the ring. I was dumping my drawer of hose, slips, socks etc into a container to move and saw a small dark bag. When I picked it up and dumped the ring into my hand I just froze in shock. Then I ran to my hubby and showed him and then just cried in his arms letting out all the years of pain and stress and guilt I had felt.

1lcijm8,Tonight I felt calm for the first time in weeks,"I‚Äôve been stuck in anxiety for what feels like forever. But tonight‚Ä¶ I stayed in, made a cozy dinner, and my new rescue kitty curled up next to me like she knew I needed softness.
For the first time in weeks, I didn‚Äôt spiral. I didn‚Äôt try to fix everything. I just let myself be.
It‚Äôs a small moment, but it felt like a huge win. ",1750043739.0,339,9,happy,https://i.redd.it/uljak8dji77f1.jpeg,2025-06-16 03:15:39+00:00

1lcmxmu,16/06/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy,"* I woke up to a Happy Father's Day message from my good friend Little Tato. She didn't need to and she went out of her way to say it. The fast we joke, she calls me papa. She's like a daughter, it' means a lot, I woke up emotional, it was really nice, great start to my day. Thank you Little Tato.
* I was invited to and met with the local Rotary Club, they were planning the event we're putting on to help those affected by domestic violence. I have now become a sponsor and they are looking to me for answers and are valuing my input. It makes me happy that they trust my opinion.
* I made my wife extra happy to (which makes me happy) by buying her an Almond Chai Latte and bringing it to work. I like making her happy, she is my favourite person.",1750060114.0,12,1,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1lcmxmu/160625_posting_daily_updates_on_what_made_me_happy/,2025-06-16 07:48:34+00:00
