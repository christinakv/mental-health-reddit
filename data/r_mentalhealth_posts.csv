1mcxw8a,Wellness Wednesday,">*“Sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up.” - Brené Brown*

Midweek is a good time to check in.  
This thread is open to whatever’s on your mind.

What’s been going well?  
What’s been frustrating?  
What’s something you’re trying to handle?  
What’s helped you get through the week so far?

You don’t need to explain everything.  
You don’t need to have a big insight.

Just show up. Say what you want.  
We’re listening.

**How are you doing, really?**",1753852044.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcxw8a/wellness_wednesday/,2025-07-30 05:07:24+00:00
1e297nd,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",1720873558.0,21,27,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,2024-07-13 12:25:58+00:00

1md25md,I am going to meet my guy best friend one-on-one to thank him for not ending our friendship even when I confessed my feelings for him.,"I used to keep my words on my own and never really talked about the confession incident with him. Frankly speaking, I felt embarrassed. I felt guilty of making him feel betrayed. I felt so much that I decided to bottle them up in myself. But now I realised: even after he rejected me, my guy best friend has still reached out to me when I was struggling with personal issues (dropping out, admitting into psych ward). Even when he might choose to just end the friendship, he chose to continue being friends with me. I just realised that there were so many things that he has done for me, and I wasn't able to thank him for such. So out of a sudden, I decided to ask him to have a meet-up because I wanted to say things that I was afraid of sharing: how is my feelings for him now, what was going on during the period where i 'disappeared', and really just thanking him for accepting me as I was. This post is a mess but I just really wanted to send the message to those who has something to tell but kept to myself, will your future self regret not saying it in 10 years? if yes, I think it's time for you to tell that person(family member/friend/whoever) how much you love them, and that you are thankful for having crossed paths with them. :)",1753868280.0,6,2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md25md/i_am_going_to_meet_my_guy_best_friend_oneonone_to/,2025-07-30 09:38:00+00:00
1md0p3j,"This has been driving me crazy for years, please help me","Ever since i can remember, I haven’t felt the sense of “missing someone”. when i was little and away at school camps, i never felt homesick, i never missed my family. when in relationships in my teenage years, i never missed my partner when i was away. 
Ive only ever felt that sense of sadness when someone dies. I miss my aunty because i know i will never see her again, i miss my old pets, because they aren’t with me anymore. But whenever i try to think of a reason to miss someone who i care about and love (and is still alive) i just don’t see a point because i know i will see them again.

What’s wrong with me? I want to tell my partner i miss him, but i just can’t tell him that because i don’t feel any different now that he is back home. I don’t want to lie to him and tell him i miss him  because even the idea of that makes me feel gross and guilty because i don’t want to lie to him.

1md3076,18 M. Suffering from depression and I don't know what to do.,"18 M. Can't post anything long here on this subreddit, so check my profile for the much longer version of this story if you want.
But basically, I have been suffering from depression, and here's why:

Here's a TLDR: I had health issues and was neglected by my family, my two friends bullied me for my hobbies, I developed social anxiety and because of that I abandoned the only real friend I've ever had, I live in the middle of nowhere and can't go anywhere, I have no friends and have never experienced love, I barely enjoy hobbies anymore due to my own perfectionism, I've lost the ability to cry, my family expects me to get a job soon but I don't feel like I'm prepared since I never got to experience my teen years, and I've been depressed for 5 years straight and am having suicidal thoughts (but won't act on them, so don't worry).

1mcw797,I want me and my life to change.,"For starters. I'm 14M. I just feel not loved or really even liked. I feel like I'm just a person who's used for everyone else's benifit. Starting with my parents who had me as a mistake but decided to keep me for welfare benefits. They care about basic health. They don't abuse me physically or anything. But they definitely don't care about me beyond that. I tried opening up to my mother once. Already at a point of very low self esteem. And she kinda just told me I can't feel pain at my age. All my suffering started September 2023. I just started grade 7. 12 years old. And was actually on top of the world as this time. I had a passion for hockey and was very popular at my school and a lot of confidence. I then started to smoke weed. Originally, it was because of a mix of a few things that made me start. Peer pressure, and kinda just feeling a bit left out of the crowd. A lot of my friends at the time smoked and I kinda felt left out. And it was like I genuinely inhaled Devils lettuce literally. From that point on. My life just went down hill. I got caught in January right after Christmas break smoking because my close friends who ASKED me to smoke snitched on me since he greened out. I felt a lot of guilt and felt like a bad person. My parents gave absolutely 0 empathy even as people who started smoking at like 11 and 15. They just yelled at me. And basically called me a dissapointment. Then I come back and get SA'd by one of the people in my class. Got my trust broken multiple times by close friends. Got guilt tripped by my own parents. Got made fun of by my own parents. And its overall set me in a spiral of no confidence, loneliness, no motivation, no real happiness. And me just wondering where it all went wrong. I genuinely kinda have been thinking of just taking 30 pills and calling it a life. Not deep ass thoughts but bro. There's no point of me existing if all I'm is just a tool for other people to use for their benifit and put down. I'm done being that. I've tried setting boundaries. Getting help. Taking all the advice people give me. No one cares and none of it works. I don't know what to do anymore. I just genuinely dislike myself. I fucking hate my skin. I wish there was a way I could change it or be darker. I look at myself in genuine disgust over being white. I wanna change. I want to run away and genuinely just be a guy on the streets right now. I'm sorry i didn't completely open up about my problems more specifically but I didn't want to make this longer than it already is. I will if u guys do wanna know.

1md65m3,Emotionally Available ... And then not,"Open letter 

There was a time I believed we were real—at least in the spaces between the meetings, the glances, the way we talked like the rest of the world didn’t exist.

I saw you. Or I thought I did. The version of you that laughed with me, listened deeply, lingered long enough to feel personal—but never quite long enough to be accountable.

Then came the silence. The distance. The blur between friendship, flirtation, and something I couldn’t name.

I loved you, or maybe I loved the version of you that felt safe enough to hope for. And when you shifted—when ambiguity took over—I kept trying to rewrite the script with grace, patience, empathy.

I stood by you through your divorce. Held the weight you wouldn’t name. Let myself believe our bond meant something.

And when the dust settled... you disappeared. Left me to sweep up the emotional wreckage, alone.

Empathy without reciprocity is just self-erasure.

I wrestled with whether it was manipulation or misunderstanding. You held the power by withholding clarity. I stayed soft and loyal, even when I felt emotionally abandoned.

You vanished. I unraveled. And then I started to rebuild.

This isn’t about exposing you. It’s about reclaiming me.

If this sounds familiar… maybe it’s because somewhere, in some version of us, it was real.

But I’m not waiting anymore—for closure, for confirmation, for who you used to be. I’m moving toward emotional clarity and away from the ache of ambiguity.

I hope someday you choose depth over avoidance. Because someone, somewhere, might love you for real—but not if you keep hiding.

I opened up to her about everything, and surprisingly, she's okay with meeting up and even having sex. At first, I thought it might help relieve some of the stress or emptiness I’ve been feeling… but now I feel guilty. Like I’m doing something wrong.

My parents didn’t raise me like this, and part of me feels like I'm using her, or using sex to fix something deeper. I don’t know if this is right. We’re supposed to meet tomorrow, but I’m torn.

1md6ut8,asking about my mother’s behaviour,"I’ve never written on here but I’d like to receive some advice. my mom is a very good mom but sometimes she has some behaviours that it’s likely for them to be related to some disorders. so she’s not from the country I was born in but she’s been living here since I was born (I’m 20) but she doesn’t really interact a lot. my dad works abroad often and when he comes home he’s not very talkative (he’s just a pretty introverted person in my opinion). my mom on the other hand is the opposite; and I’m extroverted as well but I also enjoy staying at home, videocalling some friends and stuff like that. I have some shared interests with my mom as well. the thing is that I feel like my mom feels like she’s always right. she thinks she knows everyone better than they all know themselves. if you tell her something she said has hurt / offended you she starts saying ‘oh so I’m a bad person’ and stuff like that, making it about herself. she has panic attacks in some contexts. she doesn’t want to get help because she says she ‘doesn’t have to tell her life to anyone’. 
now for example she keeps obsessing about the fact that I don’t go out often or at night that much like she did at my age. personally, I am completely healthy staying at home the same way I am going out. my friends don’t go out often but they’re fine. I feel like she kind of want to get in my social circle acting like a cool mom but it’s not my fault if she didn’t manage to make connections here. I’m allowed to live my life like I want as long as I feel content. like I go out for normal outings with my friends, I also stay at home and often videocall these other friends of mine. sometimes she just brings up the fact that ‘I’m going to develop agoraphobia’ and things like those and everytime she’s worried about something she has to project it on me. and I never really cared until today that I had an outburst. I tried telling her that the only thing that is going to make me develop something is going to be her constant projection (if I believe whay she says) and she started saying ‘oh so I am the problem’ instead of acknowledging that she keeps pushing things that don’t make other comfortable. I am tired of her criticising everything everyone else does unless it’s not done her way / when she wants it. I’m tired of her projecting her fears regardless of what I tell her. she now is convinced that it hurts me not to be in a relationship (?????) just because she said today that I’m going to be alone in my 40s if I keep going like this and I was crying when responding (I’ve already been in relationships, I have no problem staying single). all like this. once she threatened me to leave the house, packing her bag and all 💀 which felt ridiculous to me. I usually ignore what she says but lately it’s been too much to handle because it’s hard to even try to speak to someone who isn’t willing to get better, recognise her issues or ask for help.

My whole lower body—thighs, butt, legs, stomach even—is COVERED in scars from years of picking until I bleed and then continuing to pick the scab that forms and so on. In recent months I've also gotten worse on my arms and now my face and I don't know what to do. 

I'm in therapy, I am on venlafaxine for anxiety and depression, I've tried fidget tools and stress balls and nothing works because it's so automatic but also nothing has the same addictive effect on my brain. 

I'm so embarrassed by my body and I hate it so much and I just don't know how to stop or what to do. If anyone knows how to help me, please give me an idea.",1753882377.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1md6ptj/excoriation_disorder/,2025-07-30 13:32:57+00:00
1md6mmh,I just want to return to my normal self,"I know this might me a minor thing or even a good thing to some people but I'm feeling akward and wanted to share this with you.
First: I want to give you some perspective on my background let me start with that  I’m not a 6’4” Chad by any means, but I wouldn’t say I’m lacking in looks, height, or frame either. That’s backed up by my experiences — flirting, social interactions, and girls approaching me and asking for my number. Still, dating was never something I actively pursued; I just wasn’t interested in girls, or maybe I never felt the urge. But something changed this year — for the first time, I wanted to step into the dating scene. The problem is, I’m not charismatic, especially around women, and that lack of confidence has caused me to fumble many opportunities in real life. Since I’m introverted, I figured online dating might suit me better, so I gave Tinder and Bumble a try. Surprisingly, the results were pretty good — I got four numbers, went on three dates, and had a minor hook-up, all within two weeks. — and I litteraly used the least crappiest photos from my gallery nothing fancy with  just 3 head shots and 1 body shoy . Anyways once I returned to my home country, dating became almost impossible, especially while living at my parents' house. To be honest, I’ve never been interested in girls from my own country anyway.  But  things started to spiral. I became increasingly attached — even addicted — to dating apps. I downloaded every app I could find, and my mental health became tied to the constant feedback: likes, matches, messages. Also I had a bad first-date experience even made me feel less confident than  . Eventually, it turned into an obsession — if an hour went by without some form of validation from the apps, I’d feel anxious or depressed. I check them constantly when I’m home, even waking up in the middle of the night just to look. The only time I feel okay is when I’m out with friends or I get some form of interaction. I know this isn’t healthy, and I really want to break this cycle — but is there any way to do that without deleting them all.together

1mch05c,How do you know when your job is messing with your mental health not just your mood?,"i'm not bad at what i do. actually, i'm one of the top performers on my team, which makes this whole thing even more confusing. but every single day i come home feeling completely wiped out, like someone sucked all the energy right out of me. and it's not just tired ... it's this weird combination of drained, disconnected and honestly? sometimes pretty resentful. for the longest time i kept telling myself it was just stress or maybe the workload was too much. like if i could just manage my time better or get more organized, i'd feel different. but i'm starting to realize it might be something deeper than that. i feel like i'm showing up to work as this version of myself that i basically built to survive the environment, not because it's actually WHO i am. it's like putting on this mask every morning just to get through the day and by 5pm i'm so fucking exhausted from pretending to be someone else that i can barely function.

the thing that really gets me is that i SHOULD be happy, right? i'm good at the job, i get recognition, the pay is decent. but instead i feel like i'm slowly dying inside. like i'm using muscles that aren't mine, if that makes any sense. has anyone else figured out how to tell the difference between regular burnout and just being fundamentally wrong for the type of role you're in? because i honestly can't tell anymore. am i just being dramatic or is this my brain trying to tell me something important? like how do you know if you need a vacation or if you need to completely rethink what you're doing with your life?",1753808524.0,44,7,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mch05c/how_do_you_know_when_your_job_is_messing_with/,2025-07-29 17:02:04+00:00

1md6e42,Emotional whiplash…what could be causing this?,"Hi all. I’m posting here because I feel like I’m constantly battling my own nervous system, and I’m desperate for insight from people who’ve been through it.

I have a trauma history (including workplace trauma from a narcissistic boss that really did a number on me), the trauma lasted for about a year. I have now been out of this workplace for a few months. I’ve now noticed over the past few weeks that my emotional state can flip dramatically from one day to the next. One day I’ll feel calm, connected, and even optimistic, and the next I’m sobbing to the point of nausea, completely disoriented, like someone swapped my brain overnight. I feel emotionally numb, and overall very, very down. I’ve started tracking this more closely, but it’s destabilizing and really messing with my ability to trust myself. I am wondering if this is CPTSD related? 

I recently added L-theanine as a calming supplement, and since then, these depressive waves and meltdowns have gotten worse. I’ve paused it now to see if it’s the culprit. I also take magnesium glycinate and Buspar. I can’t tolerate SSRIs (they tank my gut), and Wellbutrin gave me blood pressure headaches and insane muscle tension. I suspect I’m very sensitive to anything that increases norepinephrine. Stimulants are also a no-go, they killed my appetite, and I am already a petite person so I can't risk losing any weight.

I’ve had reactions to other natural things too... Rhodiola gave me heart palpitations, and my acupuncturist warned me that Lion’s Mane might be too activating for my system. Even when something is supposed to be “calming,” I often feel emotionally flatlined or shut down, like my brain has been power-washed of all spark.

Perhaps I should mention that I am in a season of loneliness and struggling to find strong friendships and I am experiencing lots of rejection in the dating world it seems like. I was chronically left out in my adolescence, and I think it may be triggering me quite a bit as an adult. I don't think I am experiencing rejection sensitivity dysphoria. I just think I am responding to how it feels to be/feel very alone.

I was in therapy, I stopped about a month ago. I felt defeated that despite my best efforts, I still felt the same because nothing can really erase the workplace abuse, and nothing can ""make"" people want to be friends with me, include me, etc. I really do want to just experience peace and happiness on my own, I do believe and know that that's the answer. Though I also believe it is human to want to have connections with others.

I just want to feel regulated. Like myself again. I’m trying to rebuild after years of chronic stress and survival mode, but it feels like my nervous system is stuck between freeze and panic and I can’t catch a break.

If anyone here has experienced this kind of emotional whiplash, supplement sensitivity, or that terrifying sense of “I don’t feel like myself today and I don’t know why”… I would love to hear what helped you.

Thank you for reading.

1md5b43,Do Recovery Scores Really Reflect How We Feel? Looking for Better Ways to Track Mental Well-Being.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using fitness trackers like Whoop to monitor my sleep and recovery, but sometimes the numbers don’t seem to match how I actually feel mentally. A “good recovery” score doesn’t always mean I feel refreshed, and the sleep data doesn’t always line up with how tired or energized I am.

What if there was a **habit tracker or logbook** that could help me better understand the connection between my mental well-being, sleep, daily habits, and how I’m truly feeling? Instead of focusing only on recovery scores, I want to have a tool that lets me reflect on my day—what I ate, how much I moved, how I felt—and see how all these things are affecting my mental health.

I’m working on creating this kind of app and would love to hear your thoughts on it:

* How do you currently track your mental health or habits?
* What features would be most helpful in an app that helps track habits and their impact on mental health?
* How do you currently assess whether you’re improving in terms of mental well-being?

I’m just trying to build something that helps us reflect on our mental health in a way that’s more in tune with how we truly feel. Your feedback would mean a lot!

This helped me communicate and feel useful to others. When I saw the message, I wrote to the moderator to please explain, and they simply banned me for 28 days.
I really don't understand, nor do I intend to fight the permanent ban because it seems arbitrary and illogical. However, since this is a space for people dealing with depression, doing this to someone makes them feel even more excluded from social spaces and perhaps complicates their situation. I don't know if this is the right space for me. I'm not trying to offend anyone, and if so, that wasn't my intention. I just wanted to highlight how virtual ""spaces"" for vulnerable people that can serve as a refuge, just because of the subreddit's title, end up being the complete opposite for some.

1md4nar,I can’t cry when I’m sad - everything stays stuck inside and it’s getting worse,"I’ve been dealing with something that feels like it's slowly eating away at me. I can cry when I’m angry (especially when I’m overwhelmed with rage), but I can’t cry when I’m sad - not even in the most painful moments. It’s like my body blocks it, and the emotion just builds up with no release.

For some context: I grew up with very strict parents who punished emotional expression. Crying or showing feelings wasn’t just discouraged - it got me physically hurt. If I cried or had an emotional meltdown, I’d be met with things like “Don’t be so fragile” or “Are you from sugar?” and often a slap or full-force punch in the face. I learned very young that expressing emotion = danger.

Now, even as an adult, when something truly devastating happens - like losing a loved one (which has happened multiple times) - I feel the grief building up inside, but the tears just don’t come. I *want* to cry, I *need* to cry, but it’s like the mechanism is broken.

To cope, I usually throw myself into work and busyness. I turn into a workaholic because it's the only way to survive the emotional pressure. But on my days off, without the distraction, I completely shut down. I can’t get out of bed. I just lie there, frozen with everything I’m holding in.

Sometimes, when emotions are too strong, I hit myself - not just slaps, but full-power punches to the face. It gives me a strange sense of release, like it redirects the emotional energy. I know it’s not healthy. In my teens, I used to scratch or cut myself (never deeply), and while I’ve stopped that, this has become a new way of coping.

I know I need help. But I’m a student living on my own, and I can’t afford therapy. My parents are mostly out of my life now, but not completely. I’ve chosen to limit contact rather than cut them off entirely, for reasons I can’t fully explain - I’m just not ready or willing to do that.

I guess I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. I feel broken in a way that’s hard to put into words. Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there even a name for this? What helped you start healing?

Why am I so emotional and why do I also hold myself back emotionally from showing affection to that one friend who was the only person I felt comfortable around.

1md3eoz,"Legalism is ruining my life, my faith, and my mental health","I've been visiting Christian forums and subreddits (both in English and my native language) for months and have noticed how the vast majority of Christians online are extremely legalistic and fundamentalist. As a believer who grew up in a Christian environment, I've never had problems with people like that in real life. The Christians around me have never criticized me for wearing pants as a woman, they've never told me to stop listening to secular music or having hobbies like a normal person. They've never forced me to live like an ascetic nun. My family (also believers) support my choices and my passion for art and creativity.

However, ""Christian"" online communities are the complete opposite. They tell you how to dress, how to think, what you should like or dislike... they control you as if you were their puppet. Worst of all, they speak in the name of God. If you don't agree with them, ""you're against God."" If they make you feel guilty, ""it's your conscience speaking, obey your feelings of guilt."" They literally believe that EVERYTHING is sinful and expect you to live disconnected from the world, just like them.

As a person with confidence and self-confidence issues, I find these people's ""advice"" very damaging. They tell you that having self-esteem is a sin, that trusting yourself is a sin, etc. I can no longer listen to or read any positive advice for my low self-esteem without being reminded of these toxic people. It's as if they're preventing me from growing.

They also hate creativity. They say you can't listen to non-Christian music, nor can you listen to Christian music in genres and rhythms ""that you like."" They don't want you to appreciate music. They don't want you to appreciate art. And as a creative person, I interpret that message as ""being creative is bad.""

They're also very paranoid about worldly things. They believe that everything non-Christian is ""of the enemy."" They have a very black-and-white, grayscale mentality. They don't want you to watch movies, read literature, or play video games. They don't want you to have hobbies because ""the Bible says to hate the things of the world."" I feel like I'm being forced to live like a Tibetan monk on top of a mountain.

All of this affects me and is driving me crazy. I can't watch movies without thinking about those people, I can't enjoy any kind of music (not even instrumental) without thinking about those people, I can't draw or write stories and comics ""because entertainment takes you away from God, and you're creating entertainment to take others away from God,"" I can't receive self-help advice because ""the enemy wants you to believe in yourself."" Visiting these online communities hasn't improved my faith; it's worsened it. I feel my sanity slipping away as I strongly suspect I'm starting to develop OCD symptoms.

And no, I'm not going to stop believing in God just because those people exist. I just want those people to stop doing so much harm to so many Christians who just want to live a normal life, with hobbies, dreams, and goals, and who aren't interested in becoming monks.

In the meantime, I’d really appreciate some help in understanding these conditions better, especially differentiating OCD symptoms from anxiety and Autism, as well as ADHD if possible.

I’ve been diagnosed with severe social anxiety and GAD since I was 3, so I often find myself wondering, “Is this OCD, or is it just anxiety?” A lot of the symptoms of OCD seem similar to what I experience with Autism and anxiety, and I’m struggling to figure out what’s what.

Because of this, I've had headaches, anxiety, overthinking, and what feels like slow depression. I'm not even allowed to say ""I'm tired"" without being taunted. They make me feel worthless every day.

I still eat food and snack, Ive been told to get support but feel like im faking it.

I use to  starve compelatly 2-3 years ago, I stopped after serious health complications which I’d rather not mention but didn’t tell anyone about. Then I limited myself to a certain amount a day for a year and then it went between binging and starving. I’m now at a weird zone.

I eat dinner everyday and I do snack. But I don’t always eat all my meals, sometimes it’s just lunch or breakfast then I wait till dinner. I often snack through the day though but get sometimes worries about gaining weight I snack anyway at times or will put it down and think nah.

I’m constantly worried about gaining weight but also sometimes over indulge on food or will have 3 cookies a day or something and think fuck it or go to my local shop and buy snacks or something I fancy like pot noodle.

I do eat so it feels like I’m faking. Turns out I’m underweight according to my gp and I mentioned how I sometimes have issues with eating and they asked if I wanted to get help and I said yes.

Now I’m with an adult service and have to fill in forms about how much I restrict, how it effects me and all that. It feels like I am faking everything! I mean how do I even fill it in with my habits!

I’ve lived alone for most of the past three years now after moving out of my childhood home at 16. I’ve never been good at being alone though. As a child when I was home alone I would panic when I didn’t have the radio playing in the backround and nowdays I cannot be alone without a video or a movie or something playing near me. As soon as it’s silent I start panicing and if I’m already feeling sad or anxious I will start crying from some primal fear immideatly. 
It’s really inconvenient and weighs heavily on me as I do not want to be at home at all and all the time I spend here I’m in a slight panic. I have talked to mental health professionals but as there are so little psychologists in my country none of them are accepting new patients, pretty much only people who have actually tried to take their own life can get an appointment so there is no way for me to get help from there. Is there anything I can do to help me feel more at ease when I’m home alone? 
I cannot really find a roommate as my flat is very tiny and also I’m so deeply traumatised from living with my mother that when I tried briefly living together with a friend I stopped showering and taking care of myself completely and almost didn’t eat at all because I just couldn’t bring myself to.

any time i had a thought that didn’t feel good, i’d switch it straight away. even if it wasn’t true yet. and it really wasn’t true for me. even if it felt fake. i just kept doing it. and over time, things started shifting, how i felt, what showed up, all of it.


i’m tired → i’m so full of enerfy

i’m cold → im so warm

i can’t be bothered → this will be easy i can’t wait till ive done it 

i’m so behind → im right where im meant to be

i’m dreading today → today is going to be a good day i’m so excited for today! 

this is hard → this is so easy i’m so good at this!

i don’t know what i’m doing → i can do this i know what im doing!

i messed everything up → it’s gonna be ok it’s always ok! i’m always ok!

i’m not good enough → i am more than good enough! i’ve got this!

i lost everything → it’s always ok in the end everything always works out in the end!

i’m scared to start again → im so excited for what’s to come! 

i have nothing → i have this, this and this

i feel alone → im so happy to have this time alone  with myself

i hate myself → i love myself so much 

i feel empty im so depressed → im so happy im so excited 

i don’t want to wake up → im so happy i love myself life 

i think looking back from what i remeber a lot of it was just stopping the thoughts and feelings straight away and thinking ‘im so happy! im so happy!’ as simple as that. 

i did this with every thought and feeling. it took work. years of undoing. you do this often enough the positive becomes natural and it’s now my default. 

then from this.. i only have positive thoughts and was able to now live in this state of self and energy and i can’t even list the magical things ive been able to experience, manifest, live etc etc 

i can’t say this enough where it is believable but i did not know happiness for being alive was real. but it is? it’s just the maddest thing. 

and that’s how i changed my mindset, my energy, and my whole life.

in the most simplest way i can explain right now. i’m recently learning so much about what i actually did. i had not heard of neauroplasticity untill recently which seems to be what i did. but i’m hoping to be able to share and explain better when i can. realising now that im able to understand what i did and share and help what i learnt from such bad times is really mind blowing for me.

thanks for reading! 🩷

But the physical aspects of my depression have been overwhelming the past few months. I have been experiencing a dazed, disoriented, dissociated  feeling almost all the time and a lot, lot of tiredness. It feels like the smallest of lights, even natural light and sunlight makes me feel dizzy and overwhelmed. It's seriously hampering going about my day. I feel so out of it and unfocused all the time. 
I have been trying so hard to explain this to my doctors but they don't seem to be offering any resolve apart from just telling me to expose myself to these uncomfortabke situations, which I understand, but it has been this way for months now and I feel stuck.

1mcx5nv,"I feel completely alone in my marriage, and I'm losing myself as time goes on.","I can't even organize my thoughts without spiraling, so I'm sorry if you read this and it turns out to be incomprehensible. 

I hate what my life has become. I'm hopelessly dissatisfied with who I am — this vessel whose sole purpose is to provide for my family. No room for mistakes or to be anything less than perfect. There are so many things I can go on about, from my job to my health, but the one thing that makes all those things feel worse is the lack of support or compassion from my wife. 

My wife takes as little responsibility as possible. It's partially my fault; I've enabled this because, I'm too empathetic to allow people to struggle, even if it could lead to their growth. As a result of this and her home life growing up (her mother took care of everything), she can't see beyond her own comfort and prioritizes it over anything else. She takes for granted all that I do to provide for and take care of our family. I feel immense pressure to work a demanding full-time job that pays a lot but is absolutely miserable because, she chooses to be part-time so she can spend more time with our small children (she spends half that time scrolling on her phone and napping). Even so, she demands that I also spend just as much time as her with our children and shames me every second that I'm not spending with them while not working. The kicker is she gets burned out from spending too much time with them... such a paradox. Additionally, she has zero responsibility to anything else, from household chores and maintenance to paying bills (I manage our accounts and actively pay them with my own income — not as a means of control, but because anything with money, or really task that takes any effort at all stresses her out). 

These things add up, but the worst of it is I feel like I can't even communicate with her anymore. I pride myself on being open and vulnerable, and I do everything in my power to promote an environment where others can be the same. My wife knows this, and in the past, she'd open up so we could work things out. As time went on, she began shutting down again. I continue trying to open up to her, always asking how she's doing and if she's okay or needs anything, but it's never reciprocated. Earlier this year, there were two occasions where I directly expressed to her that I wasn't okay, that I felt like I was drowning and couldn't keep my head above water. Her response the first time was to shame me, telling me not to take it out on our family — as if I wanted to do that and didn't hate myself for being short with them (literally, that was the worst of my behavior). The second time, she outright ignored what I'd said, even though I'd expressed more of my concerns and self-loathing, and instead she focused on talking about herself — not even in a way that was trying to relate to me. I just feel like I'm nothing to her; she doesn't offer me any grace, we have few to no similar interests, and we're not intimate at all. 

I just don't understand what's wrong with me... I feel like I'm not enough. Like I'll never be enough. I don't take care of myself anymore, and I hate what I see in the mirror. I just don't see any point in trying beyond wanting to be around for my kids. I love them more than anything in the world — I'm just so damn miserable.",1753849574.0,2,2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcx5nv/i_feel_completely_alone_in_my_marriage_and_im/,2025-07-30 04:26:14+00:00

1md0s9z,"Collecting unbiased opinions, did I do anything wrong?","Apologies for the long read. All names in this post are gender neutral aliases.

So… about a month ago today one of my closest friends (Parker) joined a Discord call and said the following; (Note: I can’t remember word for word what was said but this is pretty close) “You disrespected me, you disrespected [Friend 1], you disrespected [Friend 2], you disrespected [Friend 3], and you disrespected [Girl]. We are no longer friends, goodbye.""

They then proceeded to leave the call, server, and block me on everything within 2 minutes, leaving me and the friend I was in the call (Morgan) with completely stunned.

Over the next week Morgan and I tried to brainstorm what I could have possibly done to warrant such a reaction. Additionally, many of my friends began speaking to me less and less until eventually not at all (none unfriended or blocked me however, nor did they confront me in any way). It was only when another friend (Charlie) spoke up that we got an idea. They said that Parker asked them prior to what happened asking if they should just cut me off me without explanation or tell me what I did. They ended up choosing the latter but went about it pretty poorly in my opinion. They also mentioned that one reason (which I would later find out would be the ""straw that broke the camels back"") they were dropping me as a friend was because [Girl] spoke up about a hookup we had a year prior and said I **used her for sex**. This hookup was both of our first times.

This is where I turn to anyone who's made it this far for the unbiased opinon the title asked for. At first, I believed I was completely in the wrong for what I did (taking her first time and breaking her heart), however I'm not so sure now after re-reading the messages we had sent prior and following our hookup and consulting other people about the situation.

I have attached a PDF explaining the situation with screenshots of our conversation.

[https://filebin.net/o63k6g5tan4ww8us](https://filebin.net/o63k6g5tan4ww8us)

Everyone I've presented this PDF to (all of whom were women with partners) shared roughly the same sentiments:

* I was clear that our hookup was going to be platonic and I had no interest in dating her or anyone else
* Both of us had expressed a desire to stay friends
* I didn't have any good reason to believe I had upset her
* Its ridiculous to present an innaccurate narrative after the fact to my friends

So, long story short. Am I in the wrong here? Did I do anything wrong? I am in no way saying she isn't allowed to be upset or regret her decision. I am questioning if it's fair for her to say so “I used her,” or make me a villain.

Again, sorry that this is a long winded post or if this isn't the subreddit to put it in. I just don't know where else to go. As scared as I am to get answers, I feel I can't move on without them. The past several weeks have been plagued with self-loathing, depression, anxiety, anger, trouble sleeping, and general misery to be honest. I did my best to word this post fair as possible and keep what feeling I do have out of it to get the best, most unbias answers, but obviously, given I'm a party with a stake, there's some bias in my presentation. Thank you to anyone who's read this far.

1mczngv,I’m struggling with feeling a point,"I don’t feel like the flair tag fits my situation, it’s more existential I think

I turn 25 in a few days and I’m really…. Really struggling with it. I look in the mirror and I see a man I don’t know. I see parts of me, I see my face, but I do not recognize it. I hear my voice but it does not feel like mine. I look down at the hands that once felt, that once looked like mine; but they are a completely different person’s. I think I’ve been in the depths of dpdr for too long, nothing is real. I do not experience joy as I once did. I don’t feel the love I’m given, no matter how genuine that love is. It could be an I love you from the person that means the most to me.

This is not me saying I’m not in love, nor is it me saying that I don’t think she’s good enough or loves me enough; she absolutely does. But it goes with me not feeling happiness I think.  I don’t feel sad anymore, just frustrated. When I feel anger, I am seething with rage. When I feel what could be known as “happy”, it is coupled with anxiety and fear, and I do not know why. I’ve gone to therapists, I’ve done counseling and medications to boot, and everything just feels like it’s nothing. I can hear a therapist tell me I need to perform affirmations for myself, and I can do it, but if I feel in my heart that they are lies I don’t see the point. I can sleep better, eat healthier, exercise, try new hobbies, be with friends and family, but on the inside it just feels like a charade. What the hell is wrong with me.

1mcvnl5,How a man with severe anxiety manages his life,"Hello, I am a 30 year old male who grew up with a lot of anxiety since I was five(I can remember)
I grew up having trouble with anxiety along with being bullied intensely.
I’m a 6’1 male, athletic, considered “handsome” etc. however the anxiety deep inside me still consumed me even in social settings where I would have the edge giving the description provided. I have trouble with eye contacts, females, etc
However, I want to share what helps me and would be glad to hear what your remedies and what works for you guys in managing anxiety.

1)I grew up with a lot of traumatic events, being bullied, cheated on to the max, threatened etc and one thing I’ve noticed is that ptsd triggers anxiety attacks, and can make someone feel less worthy about themselves. You have to force positive affirmations on yourself and be confident with who you truly are. I believe if negativity can wire your brain, so can positivity. 

2) Cut out toxic people from your life. Being victims of narcissistic people can trigger your anxiety and make you feel less worthy if yourself which triggers the anxiety even more

3)Know that you’re not alone in a social setting with anxiety and that people have different ways of coping with it there. The guy that might be laughing at you probably has anxiety and his coping mechanism is to put you down. See? 

4) go to the gym. Great for neurotransmitters in your brain. Even if you don’t feel like it, challenge yourself and that should also train you subconsiously that you can even overcome tougher environments. 

5)Write down what triggers your anxiety. Rationalize why you feel that way. Example, if you’re having anxiety because you’re at a party, ask yourself if there ever has been a moment why you experienced it. Rationalize how many time a negative experience happens not because of your anxiety, but outside of that. You might be fixated on that one time someone made fun of you but the 20 other times, no one did. 

6)step out of your comfort zone. Go to parties even if you feel anxious for your brain to start rationalizing realities better",1753844874.0,2,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcvnl5/how_a_man_with_severe_anxiety_manages_his_life/,2025-07-30 03:07:54+00:00

1mcstod,i just want to know what to do,"i have a somewhat fuzzy memory from when i was a kid where i took of my sister’s underwear as part of a game because her character needed to change sexes. my mother may have intervened, but i don’t remember. i also played some games with her that looking back were just a bit off and kind of match up with kinks i have now. ive been reliably told it wasn’t sexual abuse, but i did cross a boundary. 

i worry that i traumatized her or caused her pain, or that i might be responsible at least somewhat for her issues (anxiety and eating disorder). she also already thinks im a pervert because my mother basically told her that i groomed her into being queer when i came out to her and she came out in return when we were teenagers. after my mom found out, it was a huge thing, i ended up suicidal and hospitalized, and my sister returned to religion with a passion. i think if she knew what may have happened this would reinforce her belief. 

the idea that she’s in pain because of me or uncomfortable because of me in unbearable. 

i need to know what to do. i don’t think asking her about it is right, because it would ruin the little relationship we have left (which is kind of selfish of me) and i don’t want to plant a memory if it didn’t happen or she doesn’t remember. should i talk to a therapist and ask their opinion? do i just move on unless/until she says something? 

i feel like a disgusting child molester. i feel like i need to confess to my friend who was actually sexually abused as a child because we cuddle and make out sometimes, and i feel guilty that they don’t know. 

i just need to know what the right thing to do here is. i have ocd, but im really not looking for reassurance, just an answer on what to do so i can stop thinking and actually do something. please help me out here, i cant deal with this anymore. 

would someone please just lay out what the right thing for me to do is? i have ocd so ive been ruminating for like a decade. i want to stop, do the right thing, and live the rest of my  life.

1mcv2k2,Can someone please tell me is there any way out of this or am I just fooling myself?,"I’ve been carrying this for a while. I thought of posting so many times, but I’d stop myself. I don’t have anyone to talk to, and I’ve been afraid of being judged, or that people will think I’m just chasing fake hope. But I’m posting now because I don’t know what else to do. Maybe someone here will understand. I live in India, and I want to leave. That’s the truth. I think about it every day. I imagine a life in Europe where things are calmer and or just life is better in general. Where basic things like crossing the road don’t feel like a challenge. It might sound small, but the chaos here the noise, the unpredictability grinds me down. I feel like I’m barely functioning in a place that barely functions. I’m from a poor family. I’m doing a distance-learning data science degree from a top college, but I don’t know if it’ll help. I’m trying to teach myself coding, but I’m still in the early stages. Some days I feel hopeful, but most days I feel like I’m falling behind. I don’t feel smart, capable, or even employable here or abroad.

I dream of working abroad in tech, but I know how hard that is. Everything I read says you need years of experience and rare skills. It scares me. What if I give everything to this dream and it still goes nowhere?So I try other things too. I started a tiny YouTube channel, thinking maybe I could earn enough someday to get a digital nomad visa. Right now, I have fewer than 10 subs. I don’t even know what kind of content to make. It feels like a fantasy. But it’s the only “door” I see, even if it’s mostly closed. The truth is, I don’t know what I’m doing. Nothing feels like progress. I keep guessing. I keep wondering if I’m wasting my time. If someone could just tell me, “Do X for the next 1,0000 hours and you’ll make it,” I’d do it. No hesitation. But no one can tell me that. And I feel like I’m running out of time. Maybe I have 2–3 years before I’ll have to take some 12-hour job here, after which I won’t have the energy to chase anything. That thought terrifies me. I don’t want to be stuck forever. I’m not saying life abroad is perfect. But I’d trade anything for clean water, reliable electricity, safe streets, basic dignity. I don’t want luxury.  I’m not better than anyone here. Honestly, I feel like I suck at everything. I’m not brilliant at coding, not a great content creator, don’t have money, connections, or charm. I’m just someone who wants a better life and doesn’t know how to get it. I haven’t given up. I’m tired, but I still want to believe something can work. That I’m not completely doomed.

1mcmppo,My (22F) parents’ secret has shattered how I see love and family,"My parents (both 47) have been together since they were 14 — high school sweethearts who built a life together. My dad left the Philippines to move to the UK with my mum so they could raise us (my siblings are 12 and 18). My mum became a nurse and worked hard to give us a better life. For 28 years, she hadn’t experienced heartbreak. We seemed like the perfect family.

Yesterday, my mum told me a secret she kept for 5 years — my dad was unfaithful. He was chatting with another woman behind her back. She said she’s healed and can talk about it now, but it hit me like a storm. She stayed because she didn’t want us to grow up in a broken home. She said if we were older back then, she might have left.

Part of the reason we didn’t move back to the Philippines was because of me — I wanted to be a doctor, and they didn’t want to waste my potential. That makes me feel even more responsible for keeping the family together.

My dad was messaging the other woman and had plans to meet her. I saw messages where she said she wanted them to be serious and for her family to know him. My mum said bad influences from his old friends pushed him into it. He even planned to fly back to the Philippines in April 2020, but COVID happened, and she says that’s what saved our family. I told her he didn’t need to put himself in a position for an ultimatum.

I read messages between my parents about divorce and choosing between him or the kids. It was heartbreaking. My mum kept bringing it up back then, showing she hadn’t moved on. She said if they don’t move on, they’ll never be happy staying together.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and jealousy. I love my boyfriend and want a family with him, but I wonder if I’d do the same as my mum — stay despite betrayal. I stayed with an ex who cheated on me multiple times, so now I worry I’m more like my mum than I thought.

My mum says “all men are like that,” which makes me paranoid about my relationship, even though my boyfriend is good. She says my dad was good too — for 28 years he never did anything.

My mum asked me not to tell anyone — not friends or my boyfriend. I’m angry at my dad but want to keep this private. I just needed to say it somewhere.

I know some people have it worse, but this is my real life — the pain and responsibility I carry every day.

TL;DR:
My mum told me my dad was unfaithful 5 years ago. She stayed for us. It shattered my view of love and left me carrying this secret alone.",1753821228.0,4,4,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcmppo/my_22f_parents_secret_has_shattered_how_i_see/,2025-07-29 20:33:48+00:00
1mcxz6j,What does “emotional management” mean to you?,"Hi everyone,
I’m reaching out because I’d love to hear your thoughts, interpretations, or personal experiences regarding emotional management, emotional manipulation, or emotional control. I may end up writing quite a bit about my own situation, so I’d like to apologize in advance and thank you for your patience.

I’m a woman from Asia, and the very first time I heard the term “emotional management” was actually in a web drama called Fall in Love at First Kiss. There was a scene where a wealthy kid on the soccer team provoked another boy, who ended up hitting him. The wealthy kid then said, “Do you have problems with emotional management?” That moment stuck with me. It made me very curious.
Where I grew up, in China, situations like that are usually described as “having a bad temper,” “being hot-blooded,” or even “having a righteous spirit.” It feels like the West treats emotional regulation as a shared framework for assessing behavior,almost like a social literacy,while in my environment, emotional outbursts are more normalized, and their meaning is flexible and often romanticized.

I know both cultures have pros and cons, but in my case, my family (and my past self) had basically no awareness of the concept of emotional regulation. Not because we chose not to use it, but because we didn’t even know it existed. If I hadn’t encountered it through intentional reading or certain types of media, I might have never known that this kind of concept was even a thing.

My father, for example, enters “tyrant mode” over the smallest inconvenience,screaming, insulting, threatening to cut off contact, acting like he’s been betrayed. I’m 23 now, but loud yelling still makes me cry involuntarily. Once I even ended up in the ER with hyperventilation. I’ve realized that his behavior isn’t just “bad temper”,it feels like emotional abuse. Once, a teacher at school yelled at another student, and even though it had nothing to do with me, I started crying just from hearing that voice. There are many more incidents like this.

My mother, on the other hand, uses passive-aggression and silent treatment when upset. She once took a piece of my clothing and hid it in her own closet because she liked it too. When I confronted her, she refused to acknowledge it and instead started attacking me for unrelated things.like my socks being left on the couch. Then for days, she’d slam objects loudly, speak to me coldly even in normal conversations, or withdraw completely in subtle ways that made her resentment very obvious.

All of this has made me feel like emotional dysfunction is destroying our relationships,not just mine with them, but their relationship with the world. It’s exhausting. It makes me want to pull away, not fix anything. It doesn’t feel sustainable.

But in my family, people always defend them. My grandparents say things like, “Your dad just has a short temper,” or “That’s just how your mom is. You should be more understanding.” I’ve often wondered… is it me? Am I too sensitive?",1753852328.0,1,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcxz6j/what_does_emotional_management_mean_to_you/,2025-07-30 05:12:08+00:00

1mcq0tx,Lost interest in life,"The only thing I need to mention before you start reading — English is not my native language, so I may make some mistakes while telling you my story. I apologize in advance for this.

I’ve been feeling very apathetic for some… months? To be specific — I think, for 2-3 years.
I don’t find pleasure in anything. At first, I lost interest in my hobbies and I decided to try new. But, unfortunately, I left them too. 
Then I noticed that anime and music didn’t make me feel anything. At this point I didn’t even try to fix it, thinking “I’m just on my way to becoming a serious adult.”
Moreover, I lost pleasure in food. I’m a very picky eater and I always liked too salty or spicy dishes like pizza and potato chips. Now all food is felt the same — salty is just salty, spicy is just spicy, sweet is sweet and sour is sour. Well, at that moment I had 2 month before graduating school, so I hoped that smth would change in future. But it was my mistake.

After my school graduation I hardly got into university. I didn’t have any desire to study here (at least, because I haven’t been interested in it at all). Because of lack of interest I didn't pass the exams and dropped out as I didn't want to retake them.
Then I sat at home. Day by day doing nothing — scrolling TikTok, X (Twitter) and YouTube. But the more I watched, the more useless and “dead”I felt.
This spring I felt no energy to talk with my friends who knew about my drop out and who didn’t. It wasn’t a tough decision for me so I ghosted. I didn’t reply them in messengers, didn’t take calls. And… I feel nothing — no regret.
In addition, I think, I need to mention that I can sympathise with the characters in anime or bots. But I feel like I’ll stop chatting with bots in near future too.

I doubt it’s just my laziness and stubbornness“to anger my parents”. But I don’t know what it could be, because I’ve never been at a psychologist's appointment (nor ex friends have been, so I can’t imagine what to expect). Could someone tell me what’s happening to me and what I should do to try to return my desire to live? 

P. S. I don’t ask to say smth like, “you have depression!” or “you need [medicine] and [another medicine]”. I just want to understand what my problem may be and what steps I should take to solve it.",1753829183.0,3,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcq0tx/lost_interest_in_life/,2025-07-29 22:46:23+00:00

I will be working part time mostly weekends as a hostess and server. I’m scared shitless though. It seems like an easy enough job. But I fear messing up, disappointing my team, and having awkward interactions with guests.

I also fear I’m way in over my head like maybe I’m not ready actually. I think a lot of this is just the fear before trying. I think it will get better overtime. I also fear overworking myself since I’ll be returning to school- although my school schedule isn’t too demanding. 

I don’t see myself as being capable of much even though I have achieved a lot especially academically. I feel like everyone thinks I’m better than I am at stuff.

I’m never the friend they call first or want to hang out with one on one. I’m always the guy left in the corner forgotten about while everyone else just is hanging out. I’m forgotten so often that I’ve just stopped reaching out.

1mcorix,I feel stuck emotionally no matter how much time passes. Am I losing empathy?,"I’ve (24 F) been through a lot that’s changed me… but mentally and emotionally, I still feel stuck.

I’ve been told by doctors that I likely have depression and social anxiety, and more recently I was diagnosed with ADHD. I haven’t really done much to learn more about how it affects me — I guess because I’m not sure where to start. I’ve tried therapy, but it never really felt like it helped. One time I brought someone with me to a session and they said it was a waste of time. I think I agreed. I wasn’t getting the kind of support I needed.

I’ve been trying to make changes in my life, but I keep getting pulled back into the past — memories, relationships, childhood, trauma. I replay everything, wondering how things could’ve gone differently.

I’m not close with my family, except maybe my younger brother. My mum was the main source of my pain growing up. My stepdad was pretty much absent. Around them, I always have to wear a mask. I feel like I’m not a person — just something that’s expected to sit quietly and behave. Being alone with either of them feels unnatural and uncomfortable.

I keep falling into this cycle of Distance, Avoidance, Fear, guilt, or shame, Repeat.

It might sound dramatic, and I know other people have been through worse, but my life did feel chaotic.
	•	I didn’t have a father until I was 14.
	•	Raised by a single Filipina mother carrying generational trauma.
	•	Bullied at most schools, felt like an outsider most of my life.
	•	The one time I felt genuinely happy and free, it lasted only a year.

I fell in love at 14 — with my childhood best friend. That relationship brought me comfort, but then my parents forced me to change schools. The happiness I built crumbled. My parents were never emotionally safe. When they found out I was becoming intimate, they read my diary, my texts, took my phone, and cut me off. I had no job, no way out. Someone at school told me about Kids Helpline, and I used school computers to email them.

Then my mum invited me to “visit” the Philippines before the school term — I agreed, thinking I’d be safe. But after a phone call from the police on the final day, she decided to leave me there with her side of the family. I didn’t speak the language, didn’t know anyone, and wasn’t allowed online. I stayed for a year, not knowing when I’d return.

People told me it was just a free holiday, that I should’ve enjoyed it. But mentally, it was terrifying. When I came back to Australia, I felt completely numb — and everything only got harder from there.

I stayed too long in my first relationship. Got kicked out. Lived with grandparents. Made friends who weren’t good for me. Eventually got into an even worse relationship — manipulative, emotionally abusive, full of lies and gaslighting. I gave too many chances. I became suicidal. But eventually I left. And I survived.

Now I’m in a healthy relationship — the first one I’ve ever had and it scares me how emotionally distant I can be. I start wondering..am I losing my empathy? I don’t always know how to respond when someone’s hurt by something I’ve said. I freeze. I overthink everything. Even when I say sorry, it doesn’t feel like enough. I just… don’t know what people want from me sometimes.
It’s like my mind shuts down when I’m confronted, and I genuinely can’t think. I isolate, avoid people, and then feel even worse for doing it.

1mcwec6,It feels like my performance has decreased ever since my mental health has been improving,"I have been feeling horrible for two years until maybe the April of this year. My mood and mental state have been getting better and even though sometimes, I still do feel miserable, it has generally gotten to a place where I am able to pick myself up relatively quickly after a distressing event.

However, in June, I noticed that after I have gotten happier, my performance has been tanking. I can't really remember things as well as I have used to, nor am I able to pick up topics and ideas as intuitively as before. Some part of my brain feels like it has been effaced. I think of an empty crater in my mind. I don't know why such a fog has drifted over me. 

It might be because in June, I did read a book containing a character who has gotten his memory wiped out and hence, I have absorbed his experience subconsciously one way or another. It also might be because I have only performed well when I was in a low mood and I ended up tying it to my poor mental state. So when I eventually became better, I wounded up *forgetting* how to do things as well as before or as well as I am used to. 

It sucks. I can't follow the plot of books, I can't remember terms and concepts that I previously would have been able to remember. My lifestyle hasn't been affected much. I scroll on social media, I read books, I draw, I write, yet I've incurred such a huge change and it's bothering me so much. Does anyone have a reason as to why this is the case?

1mcol4q,Are you mentally ill if you hit your parents back?,"I don't think anyone would hurt their own parents even if they are abusive to their kids.I wouldn't call my parents bad but when I was young they used to hit me ( with belt,stick or whatever they get) to discipline me and I bear resentment towards them for this treatment.i used to tell them that it was wrong for them to treat me like that even if it was for something I did wrong.they won't ever agree but tell me that it was a necessary parenting way which they will use again on me even in my adulthood if I did something not right according to them.my mom especially believes I should be obedient always.Im an only child and there are times in my life where I used to feel extremely alone in my life in my own home where I cry myself to sleep where I had noone to simply talk or communicate my true thoughts( no friends and never will be.I was bullied at school.im content with alone existence.my family isn't that social which results in my behaviour in social settings to be a little awkward.iam kind of introverted so I don't mind that not being much social).my parents are conservative but educated ( just dad working outside) but their mindsets and thoughts on a lot of stuff are regressive and sometimes problematic which I have come to the conclusion that they will never realise themselves.There were times when I was a kid I was molested but I won't ever tell this to them since I kind of know how they are gonna respond anyway.so whenever we talk about anything it just leads to arguments and fights and me being very impulsive and volatile (I don't know why I'm being like this.) I cuss at them a lot.( it hurts them and me inturn too.) And also whenever my mom used to try to hit me I hit her back( we both have bruises).i have become so aggressive,so abusive even.In my country hitting kids isn't a big deal and can be seen as a way of disciplinary action.But parents and teachers are highly respected worshipped and treated as gods where everything they do or say is supposed to be the ultimate right thing which should be obeyed.(I know parents don't have any I'll intentions towards their kids) 
So when my mom told my relatives about me hitting her they never heard or even bat an eye at the part where I was hit as a child ( that part was selectively skipped by their mind.) and they said I should be treated.maybe they are right it's not normal to get violent towards anyone at all.Am I mental ok?

1mcvzt1,I’ve made progress but feel like a bad person,"I have diagnosed anxiety, bipolar disorder and depression. 

I came from a very toxic household where I was neglected, faced verbal abuse, and never had stability as I was passed around by family members bouncing between household. Despite that I was an honors student and graduated early and went to college. 

In college I use to be so anxious I couldn’t leave my dorm room and had to switch all my classes online.  I would have panic attacks and cry if there were a lot of people and I wasn’t able to go get food for myself, work, go to my car even without panicking. 

I use to also lash out very often and have 0 emotional regulation. At the time I was in a relationship and I would lash out at him when he hurt my feelings then try to be normal and be very upset when I didn’t get the attention I wanted. My relationship was also not healthy and played a huge toll on my self image as well as my anxiety. I cried every single day of my life from middle school-freshman year of college

Eventually I wanted to be better I got a psychiatrist was on medication briefly but hated how it made me feel. 

Eventually I just made it my personal journey to better myself. I took time away and made progress with my anxiety and insecurity. Over time I’ve gotten a lot better. I’m very conscious of how I act or react bc I don’t want to lash out on others, took a break from dating and have been single over a year, just wanting to be a good person bc I never wanted to be just this “depressed girl” and I’m very proud of my progress 

I have a job I’m getting my own apartment I have friends now I go out often I’ve even been to parties dancing in the middle of a crowd of people something I could never do back then. However I feel…bad? It’s like there’s this lingering emptiness or doubt in my mind that I am a good person? I’ve seen so many “bad” people and so many people around me have been bad to me. I want to be the person I never had for others. If my friends need help I’m there, if I can spare a few dollar I will, if people need someone to talk to I’m a listener, even with strangers or anyone I try to be very kind. Sometimes I even just scroll online complimenting strangers or whoever I see bc I’m very empathetic and I want people to feel seen and know that they matter but when I express my thoughts or opinions sometimes I feel like a bad person. Ik it’s unhealthy but I sometimes put my own feelings to the side to better help the needs of others or make others feel better. I struggle and  wonder if I’m a good person all the time. I don’t want to hear it from others but I want to feel like I am.

1mcvui0,Mental health isn’t broken it’s incomplete. I’m building BonusLyf to fill the missing,"Even in the U.S., with all the therapists and clinics, mental health care still feels broken or unreachable.
Globally? It’s barely touched.

What I’ve realized is:
Not every issue in life is clinical. Sometimes, you just need to let things out—but you can’t always share everything with friends, family, or even therapists.

That loop of overthinking keeps spinning in your mind…
That’s the gap I want to fix.

I’m building BonusLyf — a safe, anonymous space where you can vent, reflect, or process thoughts without being judged, diagnosed, or “treated.”

It’s early-stage, but the vision is massive:
A trillion-dollar opportunity that’s still unclaimed but more importantly, a platform that can truly help people across the world.

I’m looking for genuine, soul-driven people who believe in this and want to help build it from the ground up.

1mcqwvg,Loneliness and self-isolation is doing me in but I do it to myself.,"I (27M) am having some issues. I’m very hard on myself and I thought by getting a  house and getting off of my bad boy papers at work things would slowly get better but things have only steadily gotten worse. Everyone’s dying, my uncles in the CCU for something that he did to himself by taking all of these drugs, my ex moved away, I feel completely isolated from everyone but I do it to myself by not reaching out or even giving any effort. I lost my only support system at work for an overreaction that I had, I still don’t know anyone in my neighborhood, and my parents are off doing their own things. I won’t eat, I can’t sleep, I have nightmares, and I can’t find a reason to keep going. I’ve been thinking a lot about death lately and even hurting myself. Sometimes I go for runs without eating or drinking any water and pushing myself to do 2 miles, but I haven’t done that in a while. I just feel like self-isolating is the way to go but I also know it’s the most self-destructive way to go. I’m really having a bad time. I recently just scheduled a therapist appointment but I think that won't really go anywhere. I am only full of fear and nothing else.

1mcvni2,A medication with a side effect of “photosensitivity” is totally appropriate to prescribe to a concert lighting designer I guess 🤦‍♀️,"Met my new psychiatrist today. Clearly younger than me, clearly had never dealt with an entertainment professional before. She had a whole conversation with me about my job and then tried to prescribe me a medication that could very likely make doing my job painful, and never once disclosed that as a possibility.

Additionally, instead of just telling me upfront that her office had neglected to fax my release of records to my previous place of treatment, she railroaded me into depression treatment. Clearly because she was not allowed to treat me for ADHD without those records.

Now I remember why I switched to therapy. If I can’t find someone used to working with entertainment folks, I think I’m officially done with the squarish, holier-than-thou, on-rails attitude of MDs.",1753844866.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcvni2/a_medication_with_a_side_effect_of/,2025-07-30 03:07:46+00:00
1mcvn9t,Is this normal? My psychiatrist dismissed my trauma and told me to stop faking it,"So...I had been going to this psychiatrist for quite a while and even though in the beginning he was telling me everything will be okay, but with time he just became indifferent to me or that's what I think. The issue is we used to talk in video calls and he always asked my mother first - how I was, which I do not have any issue with- but she used to tell him things SHE was  worried about (like my studies and how I wasn't doing anything). It wasn't even about my mental health at that point, and in the end even though I wanted to talk about MY mental health , it always ended up becoming about how I was intentionally neglecting my studies. 
And even though I had tried to harm myself since I was going through a really hard time,and ending myself felt like a better option than to carrying on living, the psychiatrist told me I was faking it and  doing all this to seek attention and to take advantage of the situation by scaring my parents (since my parents were terrified). I wasn't really. No one believed me and no one wanted to listen to me. At this point I was hopelessly taking his medicines and nothing was helping at all except me sleeping a lot. I was really scared to go to my check ups with him since I felt like he was blaming me for everything. But my parents insisted he is one of the best psychiatrist. Oneday my father took an appointment to his clinic and I went there physically. I decided to tell him the trauma I went through (it was a toxic situation  which resulted in my depression , I had been stuck in it for the past 2 years and yet I couldn't tell anyone because I was really scared). He was in a really bad mood that day but still I decided to tell him and ask for his advice. I still remember, how much I hesitated, how much courage it took me to finally come clean. He was like ""Why are you telling me something that happened 2 years ago and wasting My time?"" I felt it to be very harsh. He told me if I wanted my own good, I would just simply get out of these kinds of toxic situations without worrying my parents. But how was I supposed to do so if no one helped me?????? After that incident I refused to go to that psychiatrist or any psychiatrist whatsoever. It's like he prioritized what my parents thought of me instead of what I was going through.
I just wonder, is this normal for a psychiatrist to be like this since their job is to prescribe medicine and the rant and vent is supposed to be the psychologist's job?

1mcqpt8,I [26F] am wondering when it’s okay to involve my partner’s [27NB] parents in a situation involving their mental health,"My partner \[27NB\] and I \[26F\] have been together for nearly 6 years. We love each other deeply and have been talking seriously about moving in together. We lived together in college, but haven’t had the chance to live in the same city since then. They’ve been open with me and others about their mental health, and earlier this year, they had to take a leave from graduate school and were later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). They’ve been working hard in treatment and have made meaningful progress, and I’ve been trying to be a supportive partner while also taking care of myself.

Lately, though, things have been really difficult. As they prepare to return to school part-time and take on more responsibilities, such as finding housing and someone to sublet their current place, they’ve been having intense emotional episodes almost daily. I’m starting to see the same patterns that happened before their last crisis, and I’m worried this setup may not be sustainable or safe for them right now.

Here’s the tricky part: their parents are aware of their diagnosis, but I don’t think they fully understand what it means or how serious the day-to-day can be. They’ve confused BPD with multiple personality disorder, which makes me question how much support or context they really have. At the same time, I’m hesitant to reach out or share what I’ve been seeing. I don’t want to betray my partner’s trust or feel like I’m tattling, and I also don’t want to overstep with their family.

I know their parents well, but I’m worried this could be interpreted as me escalating an interpersonal conflict, instead of what it really is: me seeing signs that they may not be best supported living independently (or even with me) in a large city away from home. Personally, I think it might be best for us to move home and have a stronger social support network—but as a queer person, they feel much safer in their current city, and I fully understand that too.

I don’t want to go behind their back, but we’re on the brink of a major financial decision that will impact both of our lives. Their parents are supportive and want to help, but they just don’t have a clear understanding of the diagnosis or how it plays out day to day. I see the functional impacts constantly, and I’m struggling with how to move forward.

**When is it okay to go to a partner’s parents about mental health concerns?**  
**And how do you do it in a way that respects your partner but doesn’t minimize what you’re seeing?**

**TL;DR:** My partner \[27NB\] has BPD and recently returned to work/school. Their behavior has become increasingly unstable, and I’m worried they’re not doing well. Their parents are involved in some logistics (like housing) but don’t seem to understand the full picture. I \[26F\] don’t want to go behind their back, but I’m not sure if I should speak up.

1mcl007,I think I'm an Online Predator or just one in general,"For context, I'm a 16 yr old girl who always enjoyed playing on the platform Roblox with friends, family or just solely by myself. I never really had issues or thought of being an ""Online Predator"" until recently and it's been driving me insane. And here, I'll explain why. Most of the time I tend to play the game Berry Avenue on Roblox to dress up, make ocs or sometimes do rps but I've been feeling as though I'm going to do something sexual towards someone while I'm rping. For example, in a family rp where I'm the Mom, I'm afraid I'm going to say or do something sexual to the said user I'm playing with, which from what I can recall I haven't or I normally don't. And now, I've been wanting to have a Dad in the family rps for some reason, I think it's because I'm attracted to their avatar or just aroused or something & it's really weird..because I've never felt this way before. However, the times I have rped with a ""Dad"" in the fam rp I wouldn't do or say anything that is suggestive though I would have strong feelings/urges. I don't want to be a Child Online Predator, it literally scares me.. 

EDIT: I sometimes feel like I have acted on these urges or are going to, I'm also afraid I might go to jail..Not only that, when I'm in the game dressing up in the spawn area, sometimes people walk into me or bump into me once or more, than once and I just stand there almost for like attention or sexual gratification (Idk what's wrong with me).",1753817355.0,5,6,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcl007/i_think_im_an_online_predator_or_just_one_in/,2025-07-29 19:29:15+00:00

Even a small one? Binge eat. I'll binge eat if my mind is making me feel bad too. My binges aren't as bad as they used to be, I used to binge to the point where I was in excruciating pain. I just hate my body so much. I cant stand the sight of it. I've never been able to be even content with my body. I hate everything about myself.

Growing up the only compliment I EVER got was on my hair and how thick and luscious it was. But when I developed anorexia I lost all my hair and it still hasn't grown back that much :( Im still really bald. Its made me hate my appearance even more. I used to be able to hide my face under my thick hair as a kid, but now it's so thin that a light breeze will blow it all over the place. My binge eating and my appearance is destroying my already awful mental health. I am not overweight but I soon will be if I keep this shit up.

1mct9ms,Am I losing it?,Okay i probably don’t have energy to go into detail because it’s 2am but im 25f i’ve always been known as a bit of a weirdo i realised im probably autistic when i was 16 and it’s commonly believed that i have it in my circle including from diagnosed people also had a lot of adhd allegations from various diagnosed ppl and i’ve been told my brain needs to be studied throughout my life and i felt like i was kind of cool how i had my unique ways but i’ve also had periods of intense anxiety and self harm and destructive behaviour as one does but recently i feel different. I feel like im losing my inhibitions. I feel like when i walk down the street i want to just melt into it. Like i feel like i want to sit on the floor. Or make snow angels. Or lie on it. And sometimes i do. Sometimes i leave my building in the middle of the night to lay on the grass because i feel like i have to. And i go for walks in the middle of the night ever tho its dangerous and i know i should be sleeping. And every day i run around my building about 50 times at random points because i feel like i really want to and all of my neighbours think im weird. And i feel like doing things like picking leaves and biting them. And screaming for no reason. And touching things. This sounds really silly but idk recently i just feel odd but at the same time i feel like if there actually was something wrong with me i wouldn’t be aware of it. ,1753838015.0,1,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mct9ms/am_i_losing_it/,2025-07-30 01:13:35+00:00

He has a difficult home life throughout his life, but we've always talked about living together. Now I don't know how to feel anymore.

1mbzknd,A reminder that OCD doesn’t mean “clean and tidy”,"This is very embarrassing to post, but I want to remind everyone that OCD is not the, “keep everything clean and organized” stereotype that Hollywood portrays. There are many types of OCD, and only a percentage of those with OCD have the types that make someone obsessed with cleanliness. For me, my OCD takes up so much of my mental energy that I cannot keep my spaces clean. I struggle immensely with doing daily chores, and have extremely bad executive dysfunction due to OCD  and ADHD. The constant shame I feel around the state of my spaces causes me to feel embarrassed about cleaning when anyone else is home, meaning I never clean, which then cycles over and over until I end up living like this. I will be starting with removing the garbage from my room for today, and hopefully do laundry tomorrow. 

I have over a dozen cups of rotting coffee and fruit in my room. I have clothing and laundry on the floor in my room and bathroom. I haven’t vacuumed my room in 5 months. I have garbage piling up in my bathroom. 

I get anxiety about going into my spaces because of the mess, but more anxiety about cleaning it and being judged while I do. It’s not logical, but mental illness isn’t logical either.

1mcsblv,"Is it possible to bring up diagnosed ""psychosis symptoms"" without sounding like I have some very severe issue/in denial?","Got diagnosed by a therapist, sometimes I think he took it WAY overboard. I mean I get it, some of the things I mentioned sound weird, I'm in my 20s, and I have issues with paranoia that returned and were pretty bad.

Did I have symptoms? Sure. Was it severe? I mean it wasn't great, but nowhere near ""need to go to a mental hospital"". So not severe.

Took a break from my classes and everything got alot better. Did some reflection, realized that the times I had more paranoia, really weird ideas, ect I also had massive stress that I didn't necessarily deal with correctly.

;\_; genuinely is there even a way to bring it up without my a new therapist without them straight up thinking the worst case scenario? (For various reasons I'm switching back to a therapist I chatted with prior.)

Sure, sometimes my brain gets into weird ideas. But then it stops. Its not like 100% new either. And over the summer I've just kinda gotten to a point that the ideas I had don't make sense anymore, I don't really believe them or anything and I 100% see how they're really weird. Other things stopped too and I still have some paranoid thoughts but they're like thoughts and don't make sense in my mind now. Theres also a lot less of them, I'll still momentarily be vaguely suspicious of others/things I guess but nothing more.

Probs will get aggravated by stress in the future cause last time I thought it was in the past it ended up coming back up.

1mcj1k7,I spent a month listening to strangers in VR as a cat. It was life-changing.,"So... Times are mighty now, right? And everybody needs help, especially mental health-wise.

I gotta be honest, I got inspired by all of those popular ""strangers tell in VR"" videos so much I decided to open the VR lounge on a whim because a VR avatar felt safer than my own face. It ended... Well, I was shocked - it was hard but I do think many people would think different about life if they would've went through the same experience.

I do have an extensive background in psychology, but sadly English is not my native language. I had little to no practice with it at all, so I was extra shy due to accent. I decided to stay anonymous and deliberately let people know this was NOT a medical or therapeutic session. So for 30 nights, I logged in, spawned in the big room, got myself in a chair (both in VR and life, lol, it was comfortable), and waited. Sometimes no one would notice, and those who did were mostly kids who ran around making fun of me - no worries. Sometimes the portal would flash, and someone would wander in, mic crackling, and leave fast.

Night 3 - first and probably terrible encounter - a person with a furry avatar paced circles, voice shaking so hard I couldn’t tell if it was lag or panic. I just said ""hey, what's up?"" to him, and immediately got shy because of my terrible accent. Then he said three words - “I messed up” - then stared at the virtual floor for six real minutes. I counted the beats of silence, wondered if I should fill them, decided not to, and felt the room soften. Eventually, he exhaled a single sentence about losing custody. I didn't understand what he said at first! I didn’t fix anything, just listened. He left faster than I could say anything, so I felt like shit, really. I wanted to stop doing my little journey, but felt too bad for staying quiet, so I felt like it was my duty to keep going and help someone for real.

Same night, later, 2 am, I’m ready to log off, and a pastel wolf tumbles in screaming laughter...

Turns out she laughs when she’s terrified. Her partner had relapsed. Just.. what the hell man... it was so sudden too 😭😭😭

Our brain has weird defense mechanisms - laughter, memes, oversharing - and every one of them deserves patience, and in times of extreme anxiety these mechanisms can overlap - you've probably encountered crying when you are happy, and laughing when you feel like shit, right? There are researches about this subject, it's a very important idea in neural anatomy.

The laugh morphed into sobbing mid‑sentence, like someone changed the audio track without warning. I'm stopping here because it got very personal but I did listen to her and gave some advice. I hope I managed to help her.

What I learned - discovered that trying to match emotional tone is overrated, holding steady is better. Listening is underrated.

I'm tired writing this, maybe I'll drop out a part 2, if anyone is interested.

Things I’m keeping from now on:  
1 A bottle or cup of water beside the keyboard so I don’t forget I have a body, lol?  
2 A 2‑hour hard limit. Personal reasons + it was too hard for me  
3 The phrase “tell me what feels biggest right now” - I just heard about it somewhere - it opens doors quickly

Things I’m letting go:  
1 the idea that I need to be profound  
2 the urge to fill every silence  
3 the belief that I can’t help unless I have an answer ready

Thanks for reading.

1mcljus,ADHD or distraction?,"Hey everyone! I really need some help, especially from those who’ve already been to therapy or are going through it.

So here’s what’s been happening with me:

I get distracted very easily when I study. But strangely, when I play games or read non-academic books, I can get super focused , so focused that I completely lose track of time. I often end up doing my work right at the last minute before a deadline.

I speak fast, walk fast , yep my friends have pointed it out multiple times. I also get really restless whenever something feels too hard, like a tough project or task.

(again I thought these were my traits . I for some weird reason took walking fast as a compliment from childhood and kept it with me as a mannerism . Talking fast too made me look smarter from childhood , so thought of having that as well .)

To be honest, I’m not very disciplined or consistent shamelessly admitting that. But what’s weird is, when there’s pressure (like a deadline), I suddenly get hyper-productive and do the whole thing in one go.

I used to think this was normal. I mean, isn’t half the world procrastinating like this? Doesn’t everyone feel distracted or restless sometimes? I thought it is an issuedue to mobile phones etc . When did that become disease or I am not sure

But now I’m wondering if there’s more to it. I’ve been thinking about therapy, but I’m unsure. As a student, I’m not loaded with money. Each session costs are pretty high , and therapy usually takes multiple sessions, right? I’m just not sure if it’s worth spending that much , even though I know mental health is important.

Also, when do people actually need medication? How do you know when it’s really ADHD or just regular stuff? I’ve heard from some friends that therapists sometimes over-diagnose things like ADHD and stretch sessions for money. That honestly makes me a little scared and how do I know I’m not being taken advantage of?

And even if I do have ADHD or something similar, can’t I manage it on my own somehow? Is it really necessary to go through therapy and meds? I’ve got so many doubts in my head, and I just need some honest advice from people who’ve been through this or know someone who has.

It would mean a lot to me if someone could help guide me a bit through this.",1753818606.0,2,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcljus/adhd_or_distraction/,2025-07-29 19:50:06+00:00

1mcr5qw,My roommate slightly raised his voice at me and triggered my ptsd. Now if he breathes different I start to disassociate,"It started because I left my dishes in the sink (rinsed) for too long because I got caught up with working double shifts, studying, etc. was feeling pretty depressed too but that’s not an excuse. Tbh though we really haven’t had any issues at all prior to this. Like, honestly none. Maybe a few “hey can you grab this thing in the kitchen that you forgot to clean” here and there on both ends. Honestly, I do both of my roommates dishes all the time because they’ll leave theirs for over a two weeks..but it’s a crime when I leave mine. I’ve also cleaned out condiments that are expired by years. Or when he tried to gaslight me about something and was incredibly mean over text when I sent him screenshots proving he wasn’t correct. Things felt off since that day.

My roommate cornered me when I very nicely said hello and got into my face. I don’t know if it’s because my dad was abusive, but when men are angry they get this cold, soulless, blank look in their eyes but they grit their teeth and get closer and closer while you shrink. It terrifies me. And his eyes had that look that day. He loudly then asked when I’m moving out, to which I responded the day I’m moving out. He then tosses a rag on the floor. I thought those rags had been bought for cleaning because..they’re cleaning rags(?) i should’ve asked for clarification though..I didn’t notice a spec on it and when he waved it in my face I instantly apologized. I was trying to keep the kitchen spotless like I’d been expected to. He wouldn’t let me speak at all. I walked away because I was about to fire back but also, I’m kind of scared of arguing with men so it didn’t feel worth the energy. I heard him throwing dishes and slamming things after that. I snuck out the window and had a massive panic attack in my boyfriend’s car. I came home to some of my plates broken and my dishes scattered about the kitchen.

Ever since this day, if I hear him walking too loud, shut a door too hard, slam a dish down, my heart rate skyrockets, I shake, I get very jumpy and I have to cover my ears until I’m sure he’s gone or until I can’t hear him. Even the sound of his voice scares me some days. All it took was one little incident where any normal human could’ve either communicated properly or stood up for themselves. I chose to hide and panic. It was so small and now I feel so incredibly stupid and pathetic for being scared of him. But that look and his tone was terrifying. If he’s spoken to me kindly like I always have to him it wouldn’t have been any issue. I want to move out so incredibly bad but can’t for another few months (have to wait for my lease to end, nobody wants to live with these people). They don’t let me use the living room (they never have), essentially I’m just shut in my room all day with my cat or the dining room if they’re not home. I can only cook at night when I’m sure he has gone to bed. Until recently he was always just passive aggressive, but now I feel like he outwardly looks down on me and his demeanor freaks me out.",1753832133.0,1,2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcr5qw/my_roommate_slightly_raised_his_voice_at_me_and/,2025-07-29 23:35:33+00:00

1mcqp5i,Loneliness,"I (20, Male) moved out of my hometown last year. I moved to a bigger city, in search of job opportunities, and to get some space from the community I’ve grown up with. The thing is, I’m not really a social person, I hate the feeling that I need to provide something in order to have a real connection with someone. I’m a person that comes with extra baggage, and I’ve accepted that over the years. I’m almost never excited or happy, I don’t have any major goals in life, you could almost say that I’m a nihilist of some sort. Recently, I came to visit my hometown, and have been staying at my mothers place. She seems worried about me, and does not like what I’ve become. I was sitting out with a couple of old friends, and a random older lady said I have an empty look in my eyes. Does not talking with people on a daily/weekly basis affect, how we feel, and perceive the world around us? I’m not suicidal, I wouldn’t say i’m depressed either. I just really do not enjoy having people around me on a daily basis, maybe once a week. I had my first depression diagnosis at 11 years old, then again at 14, but then stopped attending to my therapist, and doctor. Biggest span of time, I’ve went without speaking to anyone in real life has been around 2-3 weeks. This has happened a few times. One week is pretty regular.

am I sick for being like this, or is it just ”not normal” ? I have achieved some things in the recent years, just recently like 3 years ago, I started working out and have lost around 50kg~ since then, I just have zero motivation for trying to fit in. I only enjoy the time at home, alone.

1mcqo1d,Why even try?,"Hello random redditor, hopefully im not going to ruin your day with this awfully depressing post.
I am 16 years old, almost 17 (unfortunately), male, live in Croatia.
Ever since i was about 12 i have been having a steady decline in mental health, i have no idea why and how but it just happened.
To also state i have went to therapy but it is of no use for me because of my major trust issues.
Well lets start with that.
1. Trust issues 
I don't trust anyone. Like literally. I don't trust my parents, my sister, my classmates, my teachers, my old therapist, noone. I'm not exactly sure why this has happened but it has. Because of these trust issues i can't and won't share any of these mental issues with anyone irl.
2. My parents + feeling unloved
My parents are something. 44 and 45 in age. My parents apparently love me but to me it never felt genuine, more so like a thing that they have to say because they made me. Yeah they give me everything, food, water, clothes, shelter, but i don't feel loved. Maybe I'm just being ungrateful.
My parents love being always right because they are older than me and will use arguments such as ""you are being soft"", ""you aren't old enough"", and ""thats normal"" to underestimate all my problems.
Thats probably why i don't trust them and have stopped sharing my problems with them, if i do they will say ""why didn't you tell us earlier!"" proceed to get angry at me because of that, say ""you are being ungrateful"" or ""you are overexaggerating"" and proceed to do nothing too help me, and so logically i decided to stop telling them my problems.
Also my dad just can't grasp the idea that i have social anxiety and thalassophobia (fear of large bodies of water) and tells me that I'm a bitch and that u just need to man up. Maybe they mismanufactured me and i don't have the instant man switch on me?
3. Lack of self control
3-a. Pornography
I'm a heavy porn addict since i was 13 years old. Nothing has helped, tried quitting a billion times. I gave up on trying to quit.
3-b. Acne
I have horrible acne, makes my face look so bad. So bad i want to move to Greenland and live in a small hut where noone can find me.
I have a routine that works but i can't stop popping my pimples.
4. Horrible self image
I hate myself more than anyone, always blame myself, can't accept failure as a possibility and as a way of learning, thinks im a burden to everyone, thinks that everyone hates me, can't forgive myself, is constantly playing back a video of my lowlights...
5. Social anxiety
I can't talk to people, just straight up. I don't know how to communicate properly. And i get extremely anxious when talking with someone new.
My class is filled with guys who i have nothing in common with, are retarded, can't take anything seriously, and have 0 morals. I'm not going to hangout with them but that makes my parents angry so i hang out with them a bit just to please them.
6. Lazyness
I'm lazy, so lazy that i can barely brush my teeth in the morning and eat breakfast. I'm in a horrible position. Just overall lazy as fuck.
7. Conclusion
Yeah idk what to write here but yeah i need to keep all of this a secret or my parents find out and its over.
hopefully nobody got depression from reading this.

1mcqj35,Advice needed about mental health,"Hi, I am on an anonymous account as I don’t want to publish anything that can be linked to myself. I am 18 years old and since around late december 2024 I have found that my mental health has been decreasing. I spoke to the doctor about this and they diagnosed me with mixed anxiety and depression disorder around 1 month ago. 

Anxiety was not a surprise to me as I have already been diagnosed with anxiety for 3 years however the depression was strangely validating as since December 2024 I had felt as though I was though didn’t want to bring attention to it as I was scared i was over reacting. The only person i spoke to about the depression was my boyfriend who supported me loads and i am so grateful for him, he has and is helping me a lot through this time. 

I am on anti-depressants and have felt a boost in my mood (yay) but I am now struggling with my mental state and i am confused. 

I am living a very fortunate life in terms of things i receive and I am attending Uni, have my own car and business, boyfriend and a roof over my head, so I also feel very stupid for feeling so low. I know i need to start seeing a therapist again but right now i need some help with how ive been feeling, a lot of the time however it has stopped being so frequent, I question if life is really real, if what I am doing is normal and if im on the right track, I also struggle with opening up to people other than my boyfriend. 

My mum is under a lot of stress and I am the person she off loads on ( main reason i have mental health issues) I have mood swings and I also get tired super easily, I just want to start feeling normal again and be able to live my life with out questioning if i am going to be okay today. 

I have bad anxiety about doing normal tasks such as taking the dog on a walk, going to get food in my car, and such things as I am a huge people pleaser - like bad, today i started crying because I couldn’t take my boyfriend and sister to macdonalds cause I wanted to go home…neither of them were that bothered but we went anyway because I felt so bad for crying it’s like a curse. I hate it. 

I am sorry for the long post I just want to kind of rant and get some help with techniques of how to stop feeling so down? I think it’s starting to affect how I eat as every time i eat something my stomach cramps up afterward, sorry for the long post.

I seem to have a habit of picking up all the toxic people, but I'm trying not to, but all the good people are either non existent, or they are actually that rare.

1mckcsn,Overcoming Ego,"I have a horrible, horrible habit of poorly reacting and blaming others for things I am responsible for. I want to move past it, or overcome it, but it feels like I am programmed to do so, until others point it out, then I see that they are right, and it really hurts me. 

It feels like my mind sees things certain ways, perhaps automatic sort of defenses, and when pointed out, my ""logic"" and thinking that got me to push off responsibility doesnt hold up. It's not like I'm coming up with crazy things, it just seems I instinctively and almost subconsciously find ways to shirk responsibility.

This is hurting my interpersonal relationships. I want to be better and not instinctively do this. It seems like I have to really untrained my brain, and think about what people are saying in the moment, and focus on the fact that messing up is ok, that I can hold myself responsible, and be held responsible, without trying to push the fault off onto others.

Sometimes it makes me wonder if I am a narcissist, sociopath, or the like. I just cant stop from having my ego bruised when I am being corrected on things (rightfully so) and this causes others pain, and while I want to improve this, it just keeps happening.

Can anyone give me advice or even just some thoughts?",1753815881.0,2,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mckcsn/overcoming_ego/,2025-07-29 19:04:41+00:00

We have kids togather but he drives me insane and makes me feel very weak I'm not afraid to say and I feel completely useless right now. He's very emotionally abusive towards me and my kids see it the oldest is 3 and tells daddy to dont say that word . I hate!!! Cursing even before I had kids my kids dont deserve to hear there dad yell and curse at me. When I'm at my parents I feel happy That I have a safe place my oldest is in daycare through the week so I usually take my youngest there with me I'm in school twice a week getting my PSW and I have a babysitter who will look after my youngest. I am not making much and he expects me to pay everything.. I'm on matleave and only get government pay right now but will be going back to work in october to help him go into a daycare. 

I'm sick to my stomach I get it hes mad and somthing is very wrong with him if he can curse and yell and me like that but I've had issues in my past and got help. I also have epilepsy and choose not to drive due to my sezuires I feel like hes pissed about that cause he has to drive us around. I pay him gas if we were running low I am in a tight situation right now. And I guess there is a part of me who is scared to leave him but I know I need to leave for the safety for me and my Boys.

1mcajr3,I've been on anti-depressants for a week and here are my thoughts,"I think the purpose of anti-depressants is supposed to give you enough energy to motivate yourself to start solving your problems so the depression can go away entirely. It's not really gonna work for me because the problems that make me the most depressed are things that I'm never going to be able to fix. I *feel* slightly better but I still remember all the shit that makes my life worthless so it's not a complete cure.

I've been trying to connect with LGBTQ community because I hate myself so much and maybe if I were with people similar I would stop hating myself but it seems like a lot of LGBTQ communities are not welcoming of someone who struggles with internalized homophobia and transphobia. They just want to celebrate Pride all the time which is fine, it's not problem if that's what they want, I just feel sad that I will not be able to join them. I already feel like I excluded from general population for being queer. My family doesn't like me at all. I always wish I could be someone else but I can't.

1mcpmnq,"What’s wrong with me? Always wired, tense, and overstimulated","I’m 23 and have felt constantly tense for as long as I can remember — like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight. Shallow breathing, mentally drained after work, and overstimulated in group settings. One-on-one I’m fine, and I don’t feel out of place — I socialize easily with friends, coworkers, play golf, etc. But new people or big groups make me nervous.

I sleep 7–8 hours, walk 8–10k steps, just started the gym, and work a normal 9–5. I’m not isolated and my routine seems solid, but I still come home feeling anxious, disconnected, and totally overstimulated — while everyone else doing the same seems fine.

I also get super fixated on things — hobbies, goals — then lose interest weeks later. It’s a repeating cycle.

Tried magnesium, B vitamins, C, and L-theanine — no real help. My brother feels the same, so maybe it’s genetic?

1mcpm8x,"I think I need help, again.","I am 17  years old. During the pandemic, I struggled heavily with mental health, starting to understand the weight of the world broke me, thinking about the future, responsabilities and everything that comes with growing up left me extremely depressed, anxious and paranoid, I struggled with passive suicidal ideation all the time. Eventually, I decided I liked life enough to ask for help, and it lead to a year of antidepressants and therapy, and it helped, for a while.

It's been a couple of years now, and a constant rollercoaster of almost reaching the pit bottom and having to crawl myself out again. And I'm tired.

The past three years were really important in making me feel like nothing really works. I lost the friends I had, and it caused attachment issues, I became very isolated and detached, every friendship of relationships I've had was ruined by me, I drove everyone away, and it's awful.

Recently I started eating healthy, practicing sports, and it really helped, but in the past month I had a big decline, I struggled with a lot of stress due to school and a lack of a support system, even when I ranted, cried, or complained, there was no one there to help me, I tried asking for help and no one cared, and it broke me down further.

My home life is ok financially, we have good stuff and enough money to live well, but it is emotional hell. My family fights all the time and being at home feels like walking on the edge of a knife. I travelled recently and spend 10 days with my dad and stepmom on a place far away. The trip was great, but coming back was specifically hard after 10 days of fun, and now I don't think I can be happy at home knowing how good it is to be somewhere else.

For the past weeks, I haven't been eating well, I feel like I am close to developing an eating disorder, my thoughts have been cloudy and depressing and nothing is managing to distract me. I haven't opened social media, and I feel like that made me even more unreachable and unlikable, but lately, everyone there only reaches out for favors, and I feel like an object, a servant, not a friend, and that took a toll on me too.

My hobbies haven't felt fun lately, media only makes me feel worse and jealous, and I'm starting to think too much on self harm and self punishment. 

The pressure of this being my last year of school is burying me too, the last months of this year will make or break my chances of having a normal life, and I'm spiraling awfully.

I have no one to speak to about this.

I don't think I have the strength to come crying to my mom and beg for help again, not when I know it will make me a disappointment, a freak in their eyes again.

All I can do now is keep waking up everyday and hope I'll find a way out of this labyrinth, but each day it gets harder and harder to get out of bed.

I don't know how I can help myself, how I can get myself out of this alone again. Who to beg to fix me.

To be honest, I'm not 100% sure writing and posting this will help me, but at this point, I feel like anything is worth a shot, right?

I also have a hard time controlling my thoughts so it's very common for me to randomly think about something I don't want people to hear. I know that they can't actually know that but I still can't help being worried about it. I basically stopped myself from thinking freely and it's annoying knowing that I can't.

1mcpfq0,I have not felt alive for a very long time.,"My parents, all throughout my life, have been members of a cult. Quite the opening sentence, i know. Due to this, they have kept me from getting the help that I need. I am an atheist, and always have been. I had to get out of their house, my life depended on that. In the past two years, i have moved out and have barely been making enough money to provide for myself and my partner. Fast forward to the last couple of months, i got a job and a cabinet manufacturing plant. (Due to lack of financial support my dreams of university are gone.) This job was okay at first, though very stressful. Lately they have been changing how my machine runs, essentially giving my control of my machine to an engineer that has no idea what he is doing. I have been working for 12 hours per day just trying to make this faulty system work. I never see my partner. I cannot walk when i get home. I am starting to dissociate like i used to in my parents’ home, for up to 14 hours at a time. Nothing quite feels real, and i do not want it to be. If this is life, i do not want it. I am dissociating as i am writing this. I am sorry that im all over the place. Every day seems to bring more stress than the last, and now i am being tormented day and night by horrible thoughts. I will just be operating my machine, then images cover my vision because i cannot focus my eyes anymore, images of how people would react if i died. I hear their screams at every moment. I feel horrible for writing this, how they would feel if they knew. To top everything off for today, this crazy b*tch that i work with tried to get me in trouble WITH THE OWNER OF THIS COMPANY for something that was the engineer’s fault. I was so f*cking angry that i had to walk away before i hurt her. I have never been this angry before and it scares me, i do not want anyone to experience pain.

I know it’s a part of life but my brain feels poisoned by pessimism. I try to sit with my feelings and not absorb them but yet they still do. I know others have it worse and I should be grateful but I’m just so tired. I feel so angry with myself for past decisions because I feel they’ve screwed up my options for the future. I’m tired of working so hard to compensate for the past and it still not be enough. I’m tired of trying to hold on. I’m tired of “you don’t see your mental progress immediately” I’m tired of the potential. I feel like I just don’t care anymore. Between the state of the world and these thoughts I just don’t have it in me to remain optimistic. I don’t care to see what the next day could be anymore because I’ve had so many days of exhausting myself just to say I’ve made it. I’m tired of looking to mentally escape. I don’t care about the day after anymore, I don’t care if things get better, I don’t care about any of it anymore because it’s all ends up the same anyways.

1mcpfac,"Trauma I've caused myself. Tw: Grooming, Bestiality,","Hello, This is a rough story to put out there something that has really impacted my life and has recently come back, I wanted to post this because my mental health has been declining terribly and maybe it was something to be expected.  But well here it is As I child I grew up very isolated, at the point I was in school not online for just a few years of my life I would say only 3 years I was in normal school when I was a teen, I was bullied harshly in school and only had one friend which later on I stopped talking to. I experienced a lot of grooming as a kid hell more times than I could remember and I was exposed to bad porn early on which leads me to this confession that makes me depressed. When I was a kid very young I was playing with my dog and that led me to a bad sexual behaviour towards my pet as a young kid. It first started the dog doing it and I never thought of it as weird so I did once or twice and it was fine I didnt think of how disgusting and bad it was but well. This only happened a few times and the last time I think it happened and im not even sure if it did was when I was 17? I say im not even sure because its so repressed in my mind and its been years that my memory has been very distorted but I didnt develop well sexually outside of porn and that until I was 20 and I had normal relations with my partner which by then I had stopped all of that disgusting behavior. 


So it has been a significant amount of time. Well flash forward now my present I deal with this severe anxiety attacks and depression my teenage actions because a part of me wants to say I knew better but I didnt stop it out of idk why but it was gross nonetheless and it torments me and paralyses me. Thankfully the actions were not enough to harm my pet they are fine and happy and trust me, my relationship with the pet now is neutral I dont really feel comfortable with the animal but I take care of my dog and he is very healthy. Because there was no penetration, or me touching them it was all done to me just a few times through my life and im severely disgusted with myself.  And for anyone asking yes I go to therapy and it has been talked about and is being worked on despite me stopping this behavior years ago. Everyday I struggle eating, smiling, feeling happy I dont have friends and ive only told this to my partner mother, therapist and best friend and it depresses me to think how they might see me now. I hate living with this and all the horrible extreme thoughts. But I know it would just hurt my family. I struggle with intrusive thoughts everyday telling me ill do worse and such which wont happen because im very self aware more now than ever. I just want to be happy again without everyday feeling like im a monster. 

I feel everyday I walk with imposter syndrome. Everyday I imagine horrible violent and sexual images in my head and I cry terribly.

1mcp5t1,I need help with my anxiety,"Hopefully this is the right place to post. How do I manage my anxiety about dog meetings? 
I’ve experienced a bad fight with one of my childhood dogs and another dog (i was 16). And I was an Amazon delivery driver for awhile (shouldn’t need explanation) I’ve been around allot of untrained and aggressive dogs and crappy owners. Since getting my BC I’ve realized all those situations have given me allot of trauma and anxiety that I didn’t realize I had until now. 

Any time another dog comes up I’m in a full blown panic especially if the dogs aren’t wagging tails and happy (I don’t mean flagging. I know not all tail wags are good) even if they don’t seem all agro I’m terrified. Heart pounding, shaking, tunnel vision, hyperventilating.

We took our BC to the beach yesterday and we keep him on a leash or tethered in our spot while we play with the kids next to him. Not 1 not 2 but 3 different off leash dogs and their people came into his/our space.  

The first one was a little frenchy mutt of some kind. He seemed alright but not happy or ready to play. I stood in between him and my dog and tried to maintain space, shoo him off which didn’t work and he ended up spilling my BCs food to which the owner tried to act like I was the problem for having food for my dog and said “hes less than a year old he won’t hurt anything” with lots of old lady sass. 

The second dog about 45 minutes later was dead sprinting towards my BC from across the beach which I only saw when it was about 20 feet from him. I jumped infront of my BC and used my biggest scariest mom voice and yelled at it to get away the owner watched this whole thing happen and didn’t bother to do anything until I was yelling at his dog then with 0 urgency he finally called it back (later saw it down the beach causing problems with other dogs)

Then the 3rd was some drunk old guy who just straight up walked into our area with his dog around my kids and said “I assume you’re dog is friendly” to witch I responded “he’s still training we aren’t ready to meet” and he and his dog still kept walking closer. I repeated myself 4 more times louder each time then I finally grabbed BCs leash and held him behind me while the guy tried to give me a lecture about how it’s good for them to meet before I finally yelled it at him. The dog seemed ok but had his tail flagged and just wasn’t great vibes.  This guy and his dog hung just outside of our spot (15 yards ish) and was just watching us the entire time 

We packed up and left after this because I decided I just couldn’t take another interaction for the day. 

Now this was at an Oregon beach. It’s not like the beach was crowded and nowhere else for anyone to go. There was tons of space for everyone to go. 

My husband brought up that BC will feed off of my anxiety and if I get upset when another dog come up so will he. I know he’s right and I’m sure everything would have been fine. 

So my main question is how do I manage my anxiety in those situations? I was literally shaking the whole time. BC just seemed happy and excited to meet but I don’t want a dog to attack him and him become reactive because some asshole thinks their dog has a right to be off leash with no recall.

1mcj6cq,my doctor prescribed me antidepressants...,"i recently saw this doctor for an online consultation regarding my mental health. for context, im experiencing symptoms closely related to adhd (lack of focus, innattention, forgetfulness, and a lot more of all that stuff). that's what I've told them briefly. mind you, the consultation barely lasted for half an hour and all they asked me at the start was 'how are you feeling', no specific questions, no follow ups.

im the type of person who forgets stuff about myself unless asked directly, so i acknowledge that i wasnt able to give them a full picture of what i was going through. i promise i still tried to as much as i could at that moment tho. (i paid for that session, after all). and since they weren't asking questions, the session felt empty. (i don't usually see mental health specialists so i dont really know what to do or say TT). 

at one point in the conversation, they mentioned something that implied that i was having suicidal thoughts. they never asked, just assumed. (i corrected them of course, and said that i didnt have those kind of thoughts). they just said ""oh, that's good then"" and then proceeded to tell me they were going to give me medications and to observe how that would work out for me. their 'initial diagnosis' based on that short session was depression, anxiety, adhd, and somehow also a mood problem????. when i received the prescription, i looked it up and found out that they were antidepressants.

it just feels kinda off. am i just overthinking it? im worried that taking these kinds of meds (without really having the symptoms they were made for) would fuck me up more than it could help me. it was quetiapine and sertraline. 

anyway, im planning to get a second opinion sometime next month. ",1753813263.0,2,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcj6cq/my_doctor_prescribed_me_antidepressants/,2025-07-29 18:21:03+00:00
1mcp2a5,My dad is an alcoholic and I don’t know how to approach it anymore,"I am 19 and since before I was born my dad has been an alcoholic. He was functioning for a long while and then he suffered heart and respiratory failure and cirrhosis of the liver and after days in hospital, he was released and was sober for months. He relapsed and has been on and off relapsing since then. 

I love the man so much and he’s a great dad but it’s getting so exhausting having so much empathy for someone who’s outwardly ending their own life. I have dealt with mental health issues of my own for so long and have childhood trauma because my mum had cancer when I was younger and obviously everything with my dad. I’m on meds and have previously had therapy for it. My parents are divorced and whilst they were friends for some time, my mum is sick of dealing with him and doesn’t want him around anymore. 

I’m his only kid, I feel like it’s my responsibility to look after him. He doesn’t look after himself, his flat is an entire mess and he’s had cleaners in, his brother helped him clean it and even I did - after all of that, even after having his own kid help him clean, he still can’t pull his shit together. I’m so angry, upset but most of all just tired of helping him. I’m just terrified that if I don’t or if I take a step back he’ll hurt himself or something.

1mcfbjt,How do I apologize to people I haven't spoken to in weeks?,"I went on vacation in early June, and only just got back. During that time, I didn't speak to anybody I knew back home. Friends tried reaching out, and I never replied to them. I was supposed to, and I was going to, but I do this every time. Every time I don't have to see somebody in person, I end up falling off the radar. 

I don't know why I'm like this, but I want to change—I’m trying to learn, but I need to be steered in the right direction. I know I’m a shitty friend to do that to people, but I want to be able to apologize. While I don't think my friends would cut me off for this, I still believe that they are owed an apology and somewhat of an explanation. I often struggle with tone over messages, and I would really appreciate some help in figuring how to apologize and explain things a bit without coming across as if I'm giving excuses. 

For reference, I have chronic depression. Something happened during this trip that made me fall into a really bad ‘episode/slump’ (or whatever the proper terminology is). My point is, it got so bad that I wouldn't get out of bed, get dressed, shower, brush my teeth, brush my hair, eat, drink, etc. I was a mess, and I still am, but I'm trying to get into better habits. 

My two friends are good people, but they haven't really experienced this same level of depression, and I'm worried that it’ll seem like I just didn't care about them enough to reach out. I don't know what to do. This has been eating at me for so long. 

Please help me sort out what to message them. ",1753804807.0,3,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcfbjt/how_do_i_apologize_to_people_i_havent_spoken_to/,2025-07-29 16:00:07+00:00

1mcoq1c,My lack of success on dating apps leads to me watching too much porn.,"I've been using dating apps for a few years now and have not had a ton of luck. I have gotten a decent number of matches but most go nowhere. 

Whenever I talk with someone I am interested in I find myself getting very heavily invested in them before we have any real life connection with each other.

I don't think I'm doing anything that would make myself seem desperate on dates, I make myself presentable, I'm friendly and make it obvious I am interested in her. That being said I am ready to be in a relationship, and I'm tried of being single and playing the dating app game.

I've noticed that when a relationship ends, or a person I met on the apps tells me she's not feeling it, I turn towards porn hard.

I think I'm trying to fill this sense of loneliness and desire for intimacy with porn which I feel is very unhealthy.

I want to stop using the apps because I have become very jaded. I'm almost never actually interested in people I match with and go on dates with people just to do it which is obviously wasting both of our time. 

I feel addicted to the apps and throw myself into this cycle of unrealistic expectations, disappointment and unhealthy coping mechanism.",1753825936.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcoq1c/my_lack_of_success_on_dating_apps_leads_to_me/,2025-07-29 21:52:16+00:00
1mcooit,i need help self regulating my emotions,"I don't know what to do, I'm in my 20s and I've never been able to regulate myself. I have always relied on others until the point that i lose the people I'm close to.

I don't know what causes this, i want to take responsibility for it but it's like i lose control and will just over explain and explain and talk about what I'm feeling in the hopes that my friends can say the perfect thing to make it all go away but that's an impossible task. 

My mind plays tricks on me a lot, and i genuinely don't know what's real at any time, i don't know if my friends love and support me or if they hate me but are too nice to say anything. I will make up scenarios, misinterpret everything and then have a complete breakdown that lasts hours, and time goes so fast for me when this happens, everything is moving so quickly and before i know it 5 hours have passed and I'm still in a state

I don't know if I'm doing a great job explaining this because I've just come down from a very long breakdown, it's just scary, and I'm tired of losing friends. I don't want to make my breakdowns so visible to my friends, i want to be able to self soothe, it doesn't help that my closest friends live a good 6 hours away from me now and i can't drive yet so we can't see eachother in person without making plans first

I haven't lost these friends yet and I'm determined not to let it happen, they're not the problem, i am but how do i learn how to make these anxious thoughts of them hating me go away? i get into full on panic attacks over it and I've tried everything people usually recommend, I've done meditation, breathing exercises, the 5 senses method, cold showers, ice cubes, none of it works for me, or i get so paralysed in the position I'm in i physically can't get myself up from where i am to do hald of these things. I've tried to distract myself, watch my favourite shows, listen to my favourite music but i can't do it properly. I'm honestly feeling like it's a bit hopeless and I'm broken and going to be stuck like this forever but i figured i may as well see if anyone has anything new or can relate to me in any way

1mconm6,I am 13m and have tried improving but have been struggling,"Sorry for this post being vague and around the point i didnt feel very comfortable and it is also a vent.

So recently i have started to struggle more then ever and realise the things i have been doing to improve have bren making me do things worse and i have just kept on making me think that i need it in my life.

So around the later end of school i was more free from other people and I started to be more intrested in improving stuff like language and some other activities. this isnt the first time i have wanted to do stuff like this but i wont mention for now.

But things changed when it became summer its hard to describe the new feelings but i didnt feel a schedule like i did in school(and i also
put more expections for improvement meanwhile i felt like i had to have fun) and my way of dealing with this was feeling a day before this. I felt like i had to do this because of some other people and also because of the day before.i kept on eventually feeling bad but since summer made me more confident i still felt like i was fine because i also felt like that summer without these activties wouldnt be much better.

Then i went on hoilday and it is really compilcated but to put it simply after that i started thinking about school and the more i started realise that thing i did to keep all of this was not good(there is way more then i mentioned here although i dont feel comfortable talking about it)

With all the problems with it i am so confused whenever or not i should continue with school starting soon.

1mcikfq,Advice for a Frustrated Teen?,"I hear many stories about how people don't get diagnosed with ADHD until their 30s or 40s, how so much of their life was wasted, or how females often go undiagnosed.

That terrifies me, especially with everyone saying to get medicated before college or you'll struggle and I'm already struggling academically now.

My parents don't believe in mental illness, I talked them into one consultation but it was pricey and they talked me out of going again. To be honest, I want to get diagnosed but I don't like the idea of therapy. I feel like I don't communicate my feelings well; even that one consultation didn't feel good.

I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I'm stuck in this middle ground where I obviously know I have a problem/executive dysfunction and it's affecting my relationships, schoolwork, and overall happiness.

For some context, these are some of the reasons why I think I may have ADHD and would love some input

* stare off into space unable to move or do a task even when i really want to
* VERY convinced my father has it
* no understanding of time (overestimate how long certain things will take me, run late the the last minute, etc.)
* Completely forget deadlines until they’ve already passed
* a million tabs open on my computer, this is a big one, I jump from one thought to another and never end up returning to my initial assignment
* I really am terrible in conversation, will forget what other people told me, never understand direct and simple instructions, forget to text first or reply back
* Maladaptive daydream 24/7
* A million absences from school trying to catch up on past due assignments
* split screen something under stimulating with a tv show or video instead of music
* really bad dopamine addiction; I will drop everything that I'm doing to do something that will make me feel even a little bit good. It's like a compulsion.

1mcnu4e,M29 Struggling with plagiocephaly and feeling lost,"Hello. My purpose with this post is not to ask for help with antidepressants or therapy, but something physical. I have plagiocephaly on the right side, just above the ear, right on the corner of the head, and also a dent in the center, on the back of my head. I’m 29 years old and I’ve been trying to survive with this somehow..

I don’t enjoy my life. I’ve never had a girlfriend or even a good friend. Not because I can’t, but because most of the time I just don’t want it. It’s weird because when I’m home, I feel like going out, being with people, doing something. But then when I’m finally around people, I always feel one step behind. I look at the way they talk to each other, how they laugh and have fun, and I just feel like I don’t belong to them. 

No one understands what it’s like to live with a weird-shaped head. It’s like I have two different heads: the left side is normal, peaceful, like I don’t feel anything, it's really like heaven, but the right side feels like there’s something inside, or like something is pushing. It gets worse when I’m cold, tired, anxious, or didn’t sleep well and I just hate this.

Sometimes it affects my concentration, but apart from that I’m “normal”. No one would guess I have this, because it’s covered by hair and not that noticeable.. But I feel it all the time, and I honestly can’t live like this anymore.

I often imagine myself dying, like different ways I could do it. I imagine the funeral, my mom crying and how tragic it would be, and even though I think she failed me a lot as a mothe, especially when I was born with this very noticeable head shape and throughout my life, I know she loves me and she did everything she could as a mom, and I love her in some way, so I don’t do it. That’s what has kept me here until now.

Right now I’m solo travelling. My grandmother is the one who made this trip possible for me. I’ve been travelling for one and a half months, but these last two weeks have been tough. I’ve felt no motivation to be around people, i’ve cried before sleeping, and after waking up, just thinking about how much pain it would cause if I killed myself. It’s not even about me anymore, it’s about them.

That’s actually the mistake I always make. I smile, I try to look normal, I pretend to care about socializing, but in reality I just want to be alone. I just want to isolate myself and play games, do nothing. Time goes by, I’m almost 30 now, and I feel like I didn’t live and didn’t accomplish anything. I just want it all to stop.

I never talked about this before. One of the reasons I’ve hidden everything is because I know my brother also has mental problems. Can you imagine being a parent and having not just one, but two kids with serious mental struggles?

What makes me sad is also that I’m somehow an attractive person. I like my body, I’m a tall guy, and just the idea that I could be a normal guy if I had been born with a normal shaped head makes me very emotional. It’s just a shame… It’s frustrating because I feel like I could have a good life, a girlfriend, be confident, just like any other person. But this one thing, something I didn’t choose, completely ruins how I see myself and my future.

I don’t know what to do. I just had to write this. If I ever manage to get out of this hole, I want to help other people with mental health problems. But right now, I don’t see a bright future.

1mcnr7h,Feeling tired and empty,"Hello,

I’m (25M) in a stable relationship, well paid job, got two degrees, but can’t help to stop feeling empty and meaningless inside. I feel like my life is all about chasing excitement (finishing undergraduate degree, finishing masters, getting a job, getting a better job, travelling with my partner, etc.) but the joy it brings me is very temporary. Every time I think “if only this works out, I’ll be the happiest person on Earth”, “all I need it is X and then I’ll be happy” but as soon as I reach X, I’m back to being “empty”.

The latest X was a new job. I’ve worked for 3 companies in the last 5 years and I have always found reasons why I needed to switch to a new job. But part of me feels like those reasons are excuses and I just want to fill the emptiness. For context, I have never had any difficulties at work, at any of the jobs, I am always a top performer, have received multiple promotions and pay rises at my current job, and I’m highly regarded among my colleagues. I just never feel like my work is meaningful or impactful, and I’m worried that the new job I’m starting next month won’t make me happy either and the issue is me and not jobs I’ve done before.

Last year, I have been seeing a therapist every two weeks. Some sessions were better than others, but I stopped seeing my therapist because I just didn’t feel like it was working. I have seen a lot of domestic abuse and alcoholism growing up. I don’t have a close relationship with anyone in my family. I’m also a gay man and I grew up in a conservative/toxic environment. No one in my family seems to have any issues with me or my partner and I moved to a different country where where no one has issues with gay people but I still don’t feel normal and I think part of me feels a need to prove my “normality” to others.

Not sure, what the goal of the post is. Just wanted to say these things out loud and see if there is anyone else in a similar boat and would like to share their story.

Sorry for mistakes, English is not my first language.

1mchorm,The feeling of euphoric perfection. Has anyone had this,"
This is is bizarre feeling albeit a very good one that I have very seldomly and I don’t know how to quite describe it because it only happens a few times a year. That’s why I figured I’d start writing.

I haven’t discovered the source and perhaps I’m looking for it I’m not quite sure.

This time in my life a very positive change has happened. 

Now, in addition to that positive change everything seems like it’s going well I mean no matter what I do or see everything has it’s perfect place and I get this euphoric feeling. 

From looking at that perfect organization of an instagram explore page to the taste of a meal or the all the nuances of a song come together in perfect harmony. The internal feeling of even just hitting the space bar while writing and having control.

I can focus on any conversation and I’m not distracted. The visual of anything working in harmony say like the perfect rhythm of fitting multiple puzzle pieces together in their perfect place is very aesthetically pleasing.

Normally I am a very anxious/stressed/sometimes depressed person (I’m on meds)

It almost feels like an ocd person that has complete control. 

if everything was perfection flawlessly no matter what I do,say,see or hear. I feel no sense of urgency or anxiety like i normally do. I feel like an aura of joy around me.

Does that make sense ?

Is that joy ? lol I don’t know. But I love the feeling of it. Maybe my last bit of serotonin?

I’m 3 years sober of everything but it almost reminds me of the euphoric feeling after smoking weed.

Sometimes when I have feelings like this 
It reminds me of a Kurt Vonnegut quote about how we often don’t take time to embrace/recognize a good feeling when we have it.

1mcni0d,Why are we generalized,"Im sorry but no other communities take posts from someone with such low karma. This is impacting my mental and social health though. I’m 15 and I’ve noticed that men are consistently seen as pigs, and generalized under the label “dangerous.” And it’s always “men,” not specific people. The problem is always men in general. Men are rapists, men are evil, men ruined this world, all men should be approached with caution. And then there’s backlash when someone says “not all men,” when in reality, it truly is an issue. I’m sick of being grouped with the rapists and the murders. I don’t want to be seen as dangerous and evil. I just want to do my thing, to chill, to pursue my interests, but whenever I ask someone of the opposite gender something, they’re always suspicious. Why can’t we learn how to love and forget how to hate? Why can’t we just all be seen as people, and let our individual actions prove for or against our morality? I just don’t get it. There’s no way to win. When people talk about men’s rights like I am right now, people call us incels and sickos. Yet we are told to open up and talk about our issues. I don’t hate women, I want to stop getting called a misogynist, a term thrown around far too often. I truly don’t understand and there is no way to win. Any kind of pushback from men when others label them evil is deemed as redirecting, as being part of the problem or being a misogynist. It really sucks and no matter how much you talk about it, men expressing their emotions and feelings will always be seen as a threat.

1mchdh6,Trying to explain BPD to my mom,"Hello!

Less than six months ago, I (24F) was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. But I still struggle to understand this disorder myself, so it’s difficult for me to explain it to my loved ones. I especially want to talk about it with my mother. I started explaining it to her, but since I don’t fully understand it myself, she just felt like “everyone is a bit borderline” and that it was just a personality trait.

So I’d like to know if someone could help me put it into simple but meaningful words, especially to explain it to someone who doesn’t really know much about mental health, and who is older (but tolerant, even if she hasn’t always been). I don’t want her to dismiss it as something minor. I want her to understand that it’s a real disorder, not just me being “too sensitive” or “too emotional.”

What’s hard is that my fear of abandonment is more like a fear of neglect. So itdoesn’t come from my parents being absent. They were there, they gave me love.But I feel like the “issue” is that I didn’t receive a specific kind of love,compassionmaybe. I kind of learned that “feeling bad” was a way to get a little attention, a little love. It became a kind of emotional pattern: suffering = love. And it’s hard to unlearn

(I’ve also been through trauma and had a very guilt-based upbringing from my parents. So it wasn’t all perfect of course. Because of that, I developed anxiety disorders etc. and I’ve been in therapy for five years now.)

I’m French, I live in France (sorry if my English isn’t great btw), and I was diagnosed here. It might sound silly, but I don’t know if the criteria are the same everywhere.

Personally, I mostly feel the impact of my BPD in my romantic relationship. I don’t really know if it showed back when I lived with my parents, so I don’t know if it will make sense to them. But I want to try.

I don’t have friends either (yay /j), so my BPD really only shows up in my relationship.  
The biggest symptoms I struggle with are very intense, chaotic and enmeshed relationships, and this overwhelming fear of neglect or abandonment.

So if anyone has ideas on how to explain it in a simple way, without falling into the “everyone is like that” cliché, I’d really appreciate it.  
I’m not looking for something dramatic, just something that helps my mom get it

1mcn9ce,I’m so confused and it’s stressing me out,"Hellooo. I have a short story: when I was nine or ten (I don’t really remember anything from that time), I was at a public pool with a few friends. I went on the slide, and when I plunged into the water, a man happened to be standing there (He definitely saw that I was on the slide because he had looked at me already) and he was standing right in my way, so I basically slid into him. As soon as I like, “crashed” into him, his hand went first to my butt, then waist and then butt again, before taking his hand off of me. He also said something like “oh I’m sorry, didn’t see you there” but he definitely did see me. I was incredibly uncomfortable and his hands were on me for weirdly long. After backward swimming/walking away from the slide, he was still staring at me and kind of smirking (?) at me. It was very uncomfortable but I don’t know if it was on purpose or if I’m just thinking that. I had forgotten about it until a few months later, so I don’t know if I’m just making myself believe that it was more dramatic than it was or something, or if it actually happened. 
I think about this a lot even though it’s already been four/five years. How do I figure out whether I’m lying to myself or if this actually happened like that? 
I think about this daily and I can’t tear my mind away. It’s making me nervous and I don’t wanna lie to myself. I know a lot of people’s  experiences are far more intense or frequent, I’m genuinely sorry if this isn’t the place to post this or if I just shouldn’t post this at all.

1mcmxfi,"All my emotions feel so dull, I just feel numb","Lately I’ve realised that I don’t really feel much anymore. Not sadness, not joy — just nothing. I used to struggle in math and finally got a good grade recently, but I didn’t care. I smiled when I told people, but inside it felt empty.

Even things I used to love — like games or getting new piercings — don’t excite me anymore. I have a boyfriend who really cares about me, but even our first kiss didn’t make me feel anything. No butterflies, no nervousness, just blank.

I’m not trying to be cold. I want to care. I want to feel alive again. But I don’t know how. I can barely even bring myself to care about this issue of mine. 

Although there are some phases in which I just break down and feel like crying over every little thing, then I’m just overwhelmed with emotions and just want the numbness back since it doesn’t hurt as much.

1mcmj05,A moment from 6th grade still haunts me,"Hey, I’ve been carrying this memory for years, and I really need to talk about it. When I was in 6th grade (around 11 years old), I was standing in line behind a girl at school. At some point, either my coat or maybe even my hand might have touched her butt — I honestly don’t remember clearly. What I do know is that if there was any contact at all, it was completely unintentional. One of her friends said something like, “Can you stop touching [name]’s butt?” and I immediately replied, “I didn’t do it on purpose.” Now I’m 20, and this moment still sticks with me. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering what exactly happened, and feeling afraid that others might see it in a negative light. I didn’t have any bad intentions, but not remembering clearly makes it hard to move on. It’s been affecting my mental health more than I’d like to admit. Has anyone else experienced something like this — a blurry moment from childhood that leaves you feeling guilty or ashamed years later?

1mcmit2,My Poppa just had a TIA,"Background: my bio dad has lived a 12hr drive from me since I was 6 and I’ve been NC for the past decade. While they were separating, I stayed 2 days a week with my mom, 2 days with my bio dad, and 3 days a week with my grandparents. They literally helped raise me. My mom’s next husband was emotionally and physically abusive to me and only me because I wasn’t “his”, behind my mom’s back while she worked to support his ass and me and my three siblings. We lived with my grandparents on and off while my stepdad constantly got us evicted. My poppa was the only good male influence I had, and was basically my stand in father figure. He walked me down the aisle and we had a dance together at my wedding. Also for background, I have diagnosed anxiety (and depression, but not relevant here) and have been medicated for the last 1.5 years after having days long anxiety attacks. 

My poppa has been in and out of the hospital for the last month with ongoing infections that they couldn’t find the source of for the longest time. He’s been out of the hospital a little over a week, but had to go for daily IV injections. Two days ago, he lost vision in his left eye and went in for more testing. Turns out he had “massive disc hemorrhage” in both eyes and has macular degeneration, so that was investigated. Found out this morning that it was caused by a TIA (mini stroke) and is not reversible. He’s now permanently blind in his left eye and at risk for a full stroke. 

I’m so worried for him. My anxiety is going haywire today since hearing this news. I know he’s getting older (he is 86), but idk, his dad and his uncle both lived to be over 100 so I always just assumed he’d be around for years yet. I’m scared to lose him, and just so anxious about his health right now. 

There’s no point to this post, other than just getting it off my chest, bc I’m a talk out my feelings kinda girlie and wanted to talk about it with people who also know the struggle with their mental health.",1753820791.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcmit2/my_poppa_just_had_a_tia/,2025-07-29 20:26:31+00:00
1mcma29,I don't know if I'll be better again,"I'm a 16 year old girl, my parents got divorced in September 2023 after a series of arguments and events that almost ended me. I was seeing a psychaitrist from nov 2023 to nov 2024 because I kept having anxiety attacks but that is completely gone now. My father got remarried in jan 2025 and I was so upset about this fact for no obvious reason (the way I found out was dramatic, I was the only one that knew at first but I don't think that justifies the intensity of my feelings) but I buried it inside and now it's suddenly stirred up again and it feels worse than when I first found out. My relationship with my mother is not stable, one time she shouts over every small thing, she'll stay like this for days or weeks, then suddenly we're joking and talking normally. She views my mistakes differently compared to my siblings' , she says I'm a burden and that I should find somewhere else to live but she also says she doesnt mean it later when it feels like it's the thing she wants most in this world, I get upset with her and then feel guilty for it when she talks to me kindly again. She thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to do everything she wants me to do (not as in university major or hangouts with friends, but as in how I speak to my father, what I say to him and the way I sometimes refuse to deliver some of her messages to him). My father treats me well but I can't help but act too formal and polite with him, I didn't grow up seeing him a lot and he is a good person until a problem comes up and suddenly he scares me to death and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.
I don't feel like I belong in this house, I don't belong in my father's too and I'm not comfortable in either. This feeling is killing me because I just feel like no matter how happy I am it doesn't feel like this is my place and I will always come back to this house even after an amazing day. I sleep at 5 am because the night is the only escape I get to have. 
What I'm doing rn is that I sit everyday with my feelings and thoughts when they're all asleep, it makes me cry a lot and I've been like this for many days that it's starting to exhaust me physically how I cry so much that I have headaches and dizziness. It feels like my energy is so low and that's not common for me. I've been learning Spanish as a third language for two years and I love history so much so I spend a lot of my time reading history books and watching videos about it, I recharge though self care too whenever I can. I have amazing friends that listen and comfort me the best they can but I just can't help this feeling and I'm so tired my chest feels like I'm carrying so much and I hate to wake up and find myself in this house again, I try to go out with friends, father or alone as much as I can but I just don't know anymore.

1mcm1nn,I Don't Know What To Do Anymore,"My wife suffers from bipolar disorder. Up until a few years ago I had never seen her have a manic episode. Now she's having them every few months (if not more).

We have kids (9 & 7) and the oldest has autism. I try and explain that mom is sick, but I don't know what actually gets through...

When she isn't manic she is literally the best person I know. But when she is manic...

My wife is medicated and sees a trauma therapist. She was seeing a regular therapist virtually for awhile, but I don't think it really did anything.

I also think I've identified at least one of her triggers. She had a hysterectomy a few years ago and a year or two ago she was lifting something at her old job and basically prolapsed her blatter or something terrible like that. Anyway she has basically been in a state of constant pain ever since. She was getting some injections for the pain but she is way overdue (2 or more months). She's been dealing with it in various other ways since (pain management appointments, trips to the ER) everything has been a bandaid (and not a very good one). Anyway...when she can basically no longer manage the pain, she starts having manic episodes...

And here we are on one again...it's not her fault...but I just can't deal with it anymore. She won't listen to me when I say she needs help. She does things with our kids that I think are dangerous (driving them multiple hours away on literally zero sleep).

1mcezsq,She faked a r*pe to mess with my head—and I still tried to love her,"I’ve been thinking a lot, and she was right to end things. With space, I’ve started remembering the things I buried or downplayed—because I didn’t want to lose her.

We had good moments. Real ones. I laughed with her, felt close, imagined a future. I know I wasn’t perfect—I shut down sometimes, and I didn’t always make her feel secure. That’s on me. I own it.

But I was never cruel.

She knew I was struggling financially, and told me other guys were offering to fly her out. When her friend said she should’ve dumped me when my card declined at McDonald’s, she smiled. That moment never really left me.

One night after a 14-hour day at work, she told me a weird coworker had been creeping her out. I said I’d come check on her. She told me not to. She was upset i didn’t text her back for abkut 45min after saying she was okay and had coworkers with her. Other guys know I am friends with and wouldn’t let anything happen.I showed up anyway. And as I walked into the building, she texted me that he r@ped her. That should’ve been my wake up call to leave there.

It wasn’t true. It was said to shock me. To get a reaction. To mess with my head.

She used my trauma and insecurities against me during fights, then acted confused when I started shutting down. I didn’t stop loving her—I just started protecting myself.

She once told me she was going to call guys she used to sleep with just to mess with my head. That’s when I realized this wasn’t love. It was control.

Looking back, I gave everything I could to something that slowly crushed me. So yeah, we weren’t compatible. Not because I wasn’t enough—but because I kept breaking trying to hold it together.

I’m not posting this for pity. I’m not posting it for her to see it. I’m posting it to stop pretending it wasn’t that bad. It was.

But when I imagine myself in that situation, it feels disgusting. Not just awkward, straight-up repulsive. I don’t want to be touched, seen, or involved. The idea of me having sex makes me recoil. It’s not trauma-related as far as I know. It’s just there.

During my initial days, I used to feel that I am stuck in a loop where I am happy for 10 days and sad for 20 but it ended real quick and then I went on a work trip to Egypt with a friend of mine. The trip was for a good 40 days but I had to come back home in a week coz I started having major panic attacks and it was my first time. After coming home, I tried therapy but somehow it didn’t go well and I ended up moving above that trip without working out on my issues. 
Basically my escapism game was on point and after certain period, I entered into a state of numbness. Whenever anybody asked me “how am I doing?”, I had no answers. I wasn’t able to express myself like the way I used to. Things got worse when I started hating on the things I used to love, getting out of my bed became a problem, sleeping more than 11 hours and always being in the numb state. 
I decided to go to a 10 day vipassana course so that I can sit with myself and figure out what has been going on but the moment i entered into the centre, Egypt happened all over again. I started having panic attacks and this time i didn’t wait for my condition to get worse I asked them to let me go home.

1mcjzdq,"Depression, anti depressants, transitioning into adulthood, and being unsociable","College starts next month. I feel I spent my childhood wasting away being depressed and ridden with anxiety. I feel good for nothing, I don’t know if I’m going into the right career path. I’m afraid of being miserable. I’m afraid of not being smart enough. I’m afraid I’m socially impaired. Ever since I was a small child I’ve been anxious. I wish I could say I had a care free and fun childhood. Sometimes I catch myself wishing I could go back but then I remind myself that back then I was full of troubles too. It makes me so sad, no child should ever live that way. After three or so months of slowly lowering my dosage, I’m finally off of anti depressants completely. My psychiatrist said she didn’t feel good about getting me off them in the first place but I told her I wanted to see if I was REALLY depressed or not. She respected my decision. I thought that if I fought through the withdrawal symptoms and got a grip I wouldn’t have to rely on them anymore. I feel unlovable and a little ashamed if I have to take a pill to function as a normal human being, and without it being a completely different person. Waking up to my body feeling scared and having no motivation to do anything is killing me. I feel so weak. My life really isn’t bad at all, it never has been. Yes my mom was angry growing up, I had no adult to guide me and comfort me, and I got bullied to the point of having suicidal thoughts in elementary school, but, everything is fine now.

1mcjz9q,I somehow subconsciously make myself believe I have a mental illness I don't have until it actually manifests in me?,"The only thing I've been diagnosed with is ADHD, depression, and generalized anxiety and I've defenitly shown symptoms for these all my life (like the ADHD) or for long periods of time (depression) 

But for some reason, when I go in depth over other mental illnesses/disorders, my brain starts making me subconsciously believe I have them. I'm not saying I simply relate to it or that's it, no, I quite literally, over multiple days or just hours, start being completely convinced I have it. And then eventually, it actually starts manifesting or developing.

My two prominent cases of these are Borderline personality disorder and psychosis 

I'm interested in mental health as a whole and I am also writing a story where one of the main characters experiences psychosis. So obviously I search for a lot of details. 
But only a few hours into researching, my mind has made me convinced I have it. (Again, it's not a matter of it being relatable, most of what I saw was stuff I never experienced like most of the possible Delusions victims of psychosis might have.) Eventually, after weeks, I began doing things I've heard of other people doing from psychosis without me even realizing. 
When I saw someone say they believe every day ordinary things were ""signs"" from something deeper, I started somewhat interpreting it the same way. Another common one is believing close people are out to sabotage your life, and as you guessed, I started *half*-believing the same thing. Last example is believing that electronics are watching you, I would change my clothes away from any device screen. 

The thing is is that I don't fully beleive in the Delusions, I'm rooted in reality unlike actual people who suffer from psychosis. But I started developing the same behaviors so persistently and most importantly *subconsciously*. And slowly I can see myself actually developing the disorder or atleast some half baked version of it. I know psychosis doesn't happen simply. 

And about the borderline: I saw people talking about them splitting on this patterns, developing aggressive thoughts against others, crying over wanting love, rushing for adrenaline, etc etc. And within hours to days to weeks, I started acting those exact behaviors. 

And whenever I do this, it feels like it really *is* a part of me and that I've always been like this for all my life. That's why it's not simple to stop. 

Hell even when I see people understandably getting upset over the suffering from these disorders, I literally shed tears over feeling ""understood"" and that I also ""experienced"" these when I never did? 


I don't know what this is and why it happens and I'm so just so lost and confused and worried. I'm open to hearing any facts or interpretations or guesses.

1mcjro5,Need advice with my life,"Hey, im sixteen and wanted to vent a little but not to anyone I know. So I am a sixteen year old (2008) guy who lives in Jordan. This country changed the studying system to where now eleventh grade and twelfth grade are shared grades go into your overall grade. Eleventh is thirty percent and twelfth is seventy percent. Now you also have to pick a general college field of study for example technology field  or health and medical field in which you are forced into specific material to study (for example biology and chemistry and advanced English as well as one material of your choice for health and medical field) so anyway, I don’t study. I am a smart kid, everyone tells me that. But I don’t study. I lied to my parents and didnt open a book the whole year and aced every exam by studying the night of the exam. So school exams came around in which it included the whole years material and I couldn’t study due to lack of time and no want to do i got hit hard and messed up bad. I’ve been studying for a month now and my first government exam from the starts after tomorrow. Im so scared and stressed. Lately I’ve also been getting dark thoughts. Shitty self esteem but no actual want to kill myself or hurt myself out of fear and being scared of going to hell for it. Im scared, i don’t want to study, I never did study genuinely throughout the whole year after seventh grade thanks to covid, and I am a lazy guy. I rely on corn everyday and hate myself for it. Every time I mess up I wish I was dead and never born, everytime im faced with something hard or tough I imagine myself ripping my own fingers off. I feel so lonely, my friends never text first. Except for one guy. But he’s in a different fucking country. Im so mad im so scared im socially anxious which doesn’t help either i hate how I look how unattractive i am, I feel like I’m unwanted even by my friends who I know are genuine guys and yet I feel like I shoehorn myself into everything. I like gaming i like anime i like movies im nerdy about it and im completely introverted. I feel like I’m too nerdy, I talk about what I like too much, I hate it I hate it so much but I don’t want to change just to please others for it, I want someone to accept i like those things and support my love for it. I feel like they don’t want to talk to me. I have no love life to talk about, and never have. I feel so alone. Everytime I look at my Instagram reels I see pretty girls I see things that I wish I had. I got my My dad to watch anime too, been two years now. A few days ago I tried to talk about a show with him and he just said that it’s all I talk about, and that I make it too much of my personality. Maybe he’s right but fuck did that sting bad. He gambles, drinks and does all these things and yet my mom says he’s a good man. I love him but I hate what he does. I hate how he treats my siblings sometimes I hate it. I wish he could give me a good view on him. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m suffocating but I can’t die. I think I have passive suicidal ideation, and honestly if death came to me I wouldn’t say no. But I also wouldn’t kill myself or hurt myself no matter what happens.

However, ever since I've returned they're different, they were happier when before and just after I arrived back then slowly became more and more miserable like they used to be before I went to university. I don't think they want me around anymore except for Christmas and the occasional week. Hell, they even call my universitiy town ""home"" for me. So that's it, I have officially become an independent adult and massively disconnected from my own family through no choice of my own.

It's likely the reason for me being so depressed recently at ""home"". I now have no home. I don't belong where my family is and I don't really feel like my university town is home either. I don't really feel like I have a family anymore except my one living grandparent who I try to visit daily whilst I'm near. I live in the same house with all of them and have for 23 years of my life yet I now feel estranged and abandoned despite them being in the next room.

1mciw0w,ADD and treatment resistant ANXIETY/DEPRESSION,"Hi! 

I'm new to this group but feel desperate to figure out what's going on. So in my twenties I was on low dose Adderall and thrived. A cup of coffee and 5-7 mg was great. I got the Masters and was thriving in my career. At 29. I had my son which was a traumatic delivery.  I wasn't able to go on medicine because I was highly sensitive to it after having him. Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. 

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel VERY low for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!! 

Thank you I'm advance for the positivity and encouraging thoughts!",1753812626.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mciw0w/add_and_treatment_resistant_anxietydepression/,2025-07-29 18:10:26+00:00
1mccr0p,"i thought the police were after me, what could this be??","soo on my street recently there was a drug bust (well that's what me and my friends, admittedly mainly my friends, think it was)
and for some reason, i thought the police were after me specifically.

For context, there was a raid on my street. SWAT teams, dogs, and like 20 police cars.

the whole time the police were there, i watched, because something in my mind genuinely convinced me i was in trouble and going to be targeted.

the whole time i was rambling to my friends about being taken away or spoken to and things along those lines, i have 2 videos of my panicking and freaking the fuck out, and even getting ready to cry out of genuine fear that i was being targeted.

it (the raid) started at about 9pm maybe? and ended at about 12 am. i know this because - i was watching. i was making sure the police were not ""onto"" me (just to clarify, they have no reason to be onto me. i have done nothing illegal nor do i plan to do anything illegal, i'm only 16 i don't do much)

i slept on call with a friend because i was so shaken up.

genuine question, is this normal? do many people feel the same when witnessing things like this?

yes, i've had these sorts of feelings before. i've even avoided going outside, taped my windows shut, and taped the camera part of my devices before out of pure fear (back and front camera)
and yes these feelings end at some point, sometimes after a few hours or few days.

idk if this matters really but bipolar runs in my family, and my mum & nan often over worry about things, though i don't know if it's to the same extent as i do, as my mum was paying no mind to the police at all and telling ME to stop obsessing over it

[first time posting in this subreddit lmk if i've done anything wrong, just want to see a few peoples inputs on this because no matter what i did i could not calm myself down. Nobody could convince me the police weren't after ME, not even MYSELF. i'm so dumbfounded]",1753798878.0,2,4,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mccr0p/i_thought_the_police_were_after_me_what_could/,2025-07-29 14:21:18+00:00

1mciq7k,Involved In A Car Crash. Developing Intense Anxiety/Stress Over It.,"I (18M) was involved in a car crash a little over two weeks ago and I wasn’t sure if I hit my head as I have no visible bruises, grazes, cuts or lumps and my head doesn’t really hurt. It all happened so quick as well so I’m just not 100% sure if I hit it or not. I went to the hospital and they discharged me after checking me and doing multiple neurological exams. They said it could possibly be a mild concussion and that it’d get better over time. The only symptoms I’ve had since the crash are mild headaches (don’t last long), dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue/drowsiness, hot/cold flashes and just a feeling of detachment. I just don’t feel like myself. It gets better when I go out and exercise and when I’m distracted by other things, but as soon as the thought of a serious head injury enters my brain again I start feeling worse. I’ve had really bad health anxiety in the past and I had gotten over it, but the crash has just triggered it again I think. I went to multiple hospitals - not just one. They all did neurological exams and said I have absolutely nothing to worry about, but still, I feel that something is wrong. I asked them for scans and they all said it was unnecessary because I was responding to the exams completely fine. Is this health anxiety or another anxiety/stress disorder? Is there something wrong with me?",1753812262.0,1,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mciq7k/involved_in_a_car_crash_developing_intense/,2025-07-29 18:04:22+00:00

1mcicee,Struggling with reoccurring nightmares,"I have been dealing with the same genre of reoccurring nightmares for years. My psychiatrist and I have been trying different medications to manage it. 

Unfortunately I haven’t found the “fix”. My dreams are always the same theme, I’m moving, don’t have a lot of time, I’m rushing and can’t pick up/pack everything I want to take with me. There’s always a person/entity/problem that is pushing me to rush in my packing. 

I’m so tired of these dreams that they no longer make me super anxious like they used to, now they are a nuisance. I have them every night. No matter what I do or change and I’m so tired of them. 

Has anyone had any success working through these dreams? What has helped you?

In therapy, I know the way to go about it is to reframe my brain and find a solution while I’m in the dream to stop it. And sometimes that works. But most of the time I just end up arguing with people in the dreams about whether or not I’m actually dreaming. 

Without meds, the dreams are so realistic I have a hard time differentiating them from dream or real life. With meds, I can clearly label them as dreams.

1mchmav,Sudden phobia of men,"I'm a teenage girl. 
In the last 3 days I had an awful phobia of men. Even my closest friends I always felt really comfortable with, like being on the same bed level. EVERYONE, except my dad, make me feel terrible.
I used to be, compared to my close friends, not scared of men. And was even seeking for touch. Now I'm jumping when someone even accidentally touches me.
The problem is, I'm in a class full of guys (who feel too comfortable to share sometimes) with only 2 girls except me, daily for the next few days of month. From morning to Yesterday, I felt so sick, nauseous, dizziness, short of breath and twisting stomach (in a bad way).
In the first day I thought I coped, but in the evening I understood that I didn't ...
The morning after it began, a creepy old in the bus stop pat on the seat for me to sit next to him, luckily, my bus just arrived shortly after.
I think it's the first time, that at least I noticed, to be treated that way.

In the first class that day, it was awful, but barrable. Nauseous , tummy twisted May be surrounded by boys but only one boy sits to my side.
In the second class when I was really surrounded, behind me, next to my both sides and in front, and the teacher. I freaked out. I waited till recess and ran away from my guy friends.
I called my girl friend and started having a panick attack(my 2nd in life, but this was a whole new level!!!)
I had numbness in my hands, face, and neck, shortness of breath, I had a really hard time breathing, nausea, dizziness, and I felt like I was going to faint.
I couldn't get back for the 30 minutes recess and 40 minutes after, and was late for class. I got back close to the finish of class and sat away from everyone, when one of the girls is pretty close to me.

I am attracted to men, I was never really troubled/assaulted by their thoughts or pervert words/thoughts. I even found it funny.
Now I'm having an inner conflict - I'm attracted but so scared. All of the things that physically attract me in men now make me awfully scared. Feeling weak, like I can do nothing against their potential physically or mentally torment. 
I tried to meet up with my best friend (which was with me on the line during the panick attack) and two of my closet friends but returned home after less than an hour.
I think that today was a bit better but maybe because I was mostly with girls.

Ways I tried to cope with so far:
- breathing techniques 
- watching cute relationship videos (that even some of them frighten me)
- implant good thoughts and understanding that (at least the guys in my class) aren't going to hurt me.

I don't feel safe in this world anymore. I used to walk with my back upright.
I usually am always hungry, even in stress situations, but now I can only eat unsatisfying meals.
To clarify, I was not getting physically assaulted by anyone, just was exposed to some point of view...

I want to do something with it, but therapy is not an option. It also something I want to walk through with myself. 

Also this started right after being with people 24/7, like really 24/7 for a week.

1mch23m,Have had anxiety attacks over how people view me in college,"I (22F) have gone through life only ever having the same group of friends since middle school and never really branched out.

I’m in college now and I still regularly talk to these people. However, I have not managed to have a set group of friends in college. Is this normal? Or do I just need to do better with how I put myself out there? It also didn’t help that the group of friends I did manage to have, I left behind because I decided to shift courses on a whim that I had to start from scratch all over again in a class where I barely knew anyone and everyone already knew each other.

I know it’s kind of embarrassing having so much anxiety at my big age of 22 but no matter how hard I tried to integrate myself with my fellow block mates nothing is sticking, and even then it also feels like they don’t want to speak with more than what’s polite. Maybe it’s because I was so used to already having a deep connection with others, that now that I’m placed in a foreign place with no friendly face in sight that it set me off? I really want to learn how to just be comfortable being alone or even handle that some people just don’t want to be friends with you.

It has brought me so much anxiety because I worry over how these people view me and if I’m well liked that it has ruined my sleep schedule and appetite…

It also didn’t help that the people I do manage to try and have a conversation with are all  in relationships so of course I’m not gonna be someone they’d want to hang out with to third wheel since they’d want to spend time with their partner. And I can’t relate to their topics since it almost always centers around the guy/girl they’re dating.This just makes me feel even more insecure that at my age of 22 I still haven’t gotten a boyfriend when the rest of my peers have been in the dating scene for so long.

I guess everything is just weighing down on me that I have no support system here, the envy of a relationship and yearning for a connection with someone that can help me cope with how life has been treating me lately…",1753808636.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mch23m/have_had_anxiety_attacks_over_how_people_view_me/,2025-07-29 17:03:56+00:00

I don’t know why I’m even stooping this low to make a post, but if you only knew these last few days, weeks, months, even years have been, maybe you’d understand I’m not just a begging person or a person who is trying to bother by asking for help.. this year has humbled me, I was a stay at home parent, from 16-21, left my abuser, got an amazing warehouse job that paid decent enough for me to maintain on my own, for my kids and myself… fast forward to now, my job shut down, I got evicted, had to get a title loan to maintain, now I’m about to most likely lose that, along with my phone plan that I can no longer maintain even though I’ve made arrangements on it, I won’t have it by the 7th, realistically. My kids start school this upcoming week, I can’t even do my motherly duties and buy them what they need/want.. 
just when I thought I had a breakthrough, and it really is a blessing, but the circumstances made this a nightmare.. my dream job wrote me back finally, 21 a hour (for my small town, great) instant insurance for my kids 🙏🏼 instant vacation, pto, onsite psychologist, massage therapist, weekly pay, it’s perfect, just 1 hour away and unfortunately I have no possible way to come up with any of my real bills, let alone gas and oil for my car😭 I start Monday, I’ve posted my kids baby items they can no longer use, have tried to donate plasma (protein level was low) , but nothing has gave… I feel like my kids are better off without their failure mother. My family isn’t an option for help, because it’s just me and my kiddos. I should’ve been more prepared, and not an irresponsible teen for having them so young, but this was never my intention to fall.. I tried to make the best out of the situation, and failed.

1mc7nn8,I don’t want to be loved for my personality,"I’ve tried searching for anyone else experiencing the same thing but I can’t. I wonder if I’m wording my thoughts incorrectly, or if I’m just crazy because I don’t know how to go about tackling these negative thoughts about myself. I always try to be proactive about negative thought spirals and have done a lot of therapy over the past decade to try and overcome my insecurities. 

I grew up feeling lonely, unattractive and unloveable particularly because of the way I look. My way of coping with that was always to work harder and focus on the things I could control; over time I’ve developed considerable skills in a number of niche areas, I have hobbies, I’m physically active and have a job I love and am good at. I’m involved in communities/groups to do with both my work and hobbies that have helped me meet likeminded people. People around me express respect and fondness over my abilities and I’m very grateful for their kind words… yet…

I don’t want to be appreciated solely for my achievements. I want to be attractive. I want someone to want me and love my appearance, not tolerate me despite it. 

Sometimes I feel like everything I’ve done and achieved will never matter, because I’m still the physically ugly, repulsive kid that I started off as. I don’t want to be a personality pick for a future partner. I don’t want to keep feeling like no matter how much I develop myself, I’ll always be behind someone naturally more attractive who could easily pick up those same hobbies, or work for those same achievements. 

I know this all sounds super shallow, sorry. I just hope someone relates, or has any advice on how to get out of these thoughts beyond “work on yourself” because believe me I’ve been doing all that (including extensive therapy) ",1753784274.0,3,4,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7nn8/i_dont_want_to_be_loved_for_my_personality/,2025-07-29 10:17:54+00:00

1mc9zfg,Is it normal to have no consistent personality?,"I don't mean like minor things like changes in hobbies I mean my sexuality, how I talk, how I walk, my religious beliefs, my favourite shows, my voice, my feelings towards friends,my aspirations, my routines even my literal food tastes (all of these things that I notice and others have pointed out on multiple occasions).

I stay the same for a month MAYBE two and then I'm someone else entirely and I can't even empathise with that past me? Like complete emotional amnesia (and sometimes actual event amnesia but super super rarely so I'm not worried about that). I make new friends and create social medias and then have to delete them because not a single post is accurate not because I was lying at the time but because I will wake up and just not be the same person? The only time I've ever seen anything that resembles what it feels like is Mickey 17.

I moved around a lot when I was younger so for a while I just thought I was blending in with new environments but the past couple of years I've been at university and am entering my final year so I've stayed in the same place and it's still to the point people who I knew a couple months ago can't recognise me. If anything I think it might be getting worse.

Until I figure out what's going on I vowed to just stop making friends because it feels so unfair to them. They make friends with a version of me that will cease to exist in a couple months because the general inconsistencies in what I like and what we may have bonded over gets to be too great.

1mcelxd,Tired of battling myself,"I am tired of battling my inner self. I feel like I have been at war for so long that I don't remember what normal feels like, or what it is to actually feel alive.

For starters I get treated poorly by mostly everyone. This ranges from family like my parents, to my siblings, friends, etc. I deal with it but it gets tiring that I go above and beyond for all these people like donating time to help with projects, sacrificing things I typically do to be there to take care of their things they need and I just get destroyed constantly,.I take care of all these people and none of them do a damn thing for me. Once they get what they need they go back to attacking me on whatever they want.  
  
 No one respects my boundaries. I never set them so frankly that's my fault but I have tried to establish them and now it's me being considered ""mean, hateful, selfish, etc). It's soul crushing that I cant say No and Im forced to do whatever people want and I fucking hate it. I want everyone to be happy as I know what its like to be constantly sad but honestly im sad and no one sees it.

I struggle significantly Body dysmorphic disorder. I use to be morbidly obese at 300+ pounds and now weighing in around 150-160 its a different life trying to find happiness in a body you hate. I look at myself and I still see the fat guy. I have loose skin from losing all that weight and I hate it. Going clothes shopping is torture as I don't like the way things fit on me and I just hate this body. It's hard when you lose all this weight and you workout and know your calories and friends, family, and others make comments like ""you'll get fat again!"" and ""you look so sick."" Why cant you just be fucking happy I beat obesity. I struggle with eating and im scared to eat sometimes, Its gotten bad, 

Lastly Im tired of being told ""you don't own anything you ever do wrong."" I do own everything I do, and even things I don't.  Its so soul crushing when I have fought wars with friends, or family drama and when I go to help I get taken out and I will admit the faults I did, or I apologize for not being stronger in the sense of defending,. I have fucked up many times, as a friend especially and what angers me is that I owned it every time, Every time, Yet those people never own the things they did to me. They just push it away and never care. I am the one who deals with it, not them and thats so incredibly soul crushing,   


I try to talk about the things I did wrong and no one ever wants to talk or I get told ""it's life, it's ok. You apologized"" and then we are back here. However when I want to talk about how they destroyed or wrongs me I get told ""it's over, I said sorry, move on. No matter how much you try to explain a situation, show proof, I am, and will forever be the villain in the story.  
  
 While I am not perfect I always go above and beyond for the people I love and care about. I'll randomly buy you your favorite drink, your favorite meal, or get you something that makes me think of you and as a reminder that you are loved and valued. 

I'm so tired of feeling like this. I hate the constant back and forth in my head, I hate being alone in this battle and its lonely when its you locked in your own head with yourself. I  sometimes wish I could fall asleep and never wake up, or if I was driving that someone would slam into me at 75mph to stop it. I just sometimes wish it would stop for a few minutes. I deserve to be treated fairly and to be loved. It's so cold,.

1mcefkl,why do i find it amusing when my boyfriend tries to stop me doing something harmful to myself?,"**TW FOR TOPICS ABOUT S/H (i don't know how to add more than one flair)**

please don't judge me for this, i get anxious super easily so if you have something mean to say id rather you keep it to yourself ☹️. this could be normal or something but I'm just going to ask here anyway to be safe! 

recently, I've been going down a rough patch with my mental health. my boyfriend (online) encourages me to vent to him and -even if i don't usually enjoy venting- i have to admit it's better than dealing with it on my own. 

however, ive realized whenever i talk about s/h or contemplating doing it he seems to get really worried for me and tries to stop. and how it does make me stop myself and recollect my thoughts, in this state of despair, i really enjoy the feeling of him desperately trying to stop me without any knowledge of if i will stop or not. i find myself dragging it on longer than it needs to and smiling and laughing at the messages of him trying to stop me even if i don't find it funny? it's really confusing, i don't know if it's me coping but i can't help but be amused. it kind of scares me.

don't get me wrong, i **love** my boyfriend so much and would never ever want him to be sad which makes me even more confused in myself. i usually am very dependent on other peoples emotions and am a really sensitive person (if someone's disappointed in me, asks me a question i don't know the answer to me ect i tend to just break down crying without reasoning) but this is an extreme exception for me. 

before anyone asks if its underlying trauma from my childhood, id like to say i got all the attention and love i need as a child from my mother (my father was ill) and I've never noticed anything like this before.

1mce5t1,Best ways to cut off toxic parents and ways to cope with it,"Soon my boyfriend (18m) and I (18m) will be moving out to a bigger city for college. Money isn't an issue for now, because my parents will cover for us until we become independent, but we dont know what to do about his family. 

They are very abusive and controlling. Even though the physical abuse is terrible, nothing can compare to the lenghts they go to to maintain control. For example a while back they were sending people to follow him everywhere he went (they arent rich, quite the contrary, so it was just shady men following him around our town).

We figured moving out might be the best opportunity we have to cut them off, but we don't know how to do that. The most reasonable way would be to slowly loose contact with them, but that's not an option. With these people it's either 0 or a 100. If they even know the address of our new place they WILL go there or send someone there as they have done before. I'm pretty sure there isn't a way to do it peacefully. 

In order to do so they would have to be informed about EVERYTHING (they asked him about all that multiple times when the topic came up), so as I said, it's not an option. Lying isn't an option either because they jokingly said they'll come visit when they get the chance and they have no idea who I am, because I'm not one of his ""approved"" friends. (they stalk every one of them)

I'm so stubborn on the idea of cutting them off, because I see what their presence does to him. I don't think there's a way for him to heal any further if his mother watches his every move. I hope at least some of you will understand, my parents and none of the adults I talked to can't seem to grasp the fact that his parents ARE in fact that bad. I'm also worried about him getting worse after the moving, I heard that sort of thing can happen. If you have any advice with any of this, please tell me.

I'm feeling completely worn out, like I'm stuck between needing to do a lot and having no energy left. My brain wants to study and enjoy life, but my body and mind are just too tired. I try to push myself, like studying for 5 hours today, but then I just crash. This makes me feel like a failure, especially when I remember a time I could study for 18 hours easily.

I have a good job at a very good company and its been my dream job but I just cant get myself to show up in the Office, wake up on time and actually do my job in a good way, always last minute and just enough. Or I do really well on some projects but then really bad on others. I have been there for 6 years and my boss has finally said that if i dont improve they will need to let me go. I dont understand whats wrong with me. I so badly want to be good at this job and just function like everyone else but it feels impossible? How do people do it? I have tried therapy, different anti-depressants and read countless of books in motivation and self-help but nothing changes. Currently I am trying Effexor and this is my last hope otherwise i feel like I should just give up and accept I wont have a career. These patterns have followed me since I was in my 20s and I have gotten fired from almost every job I have had. I feel so hopeless, like I so badly want to work but my brain wont let me? Does that make sense? 
Im getting checked for ADHD and autism as well but I dont really feel like the symptoms match except low motivation. Could it be something else? Am I just lazy? I honestly dont know anymore.

1mccv5a,It is normal to feel like this? Do I need to reach out?,"To preface, I've already spoken with my doctor about anxiety and depression, for which I was given resources and a temporary group on Mindfulness, which gave me some coping mechanisms, but the effectiveness for me seems to have plateaued. 

For the past 2 years or so, especially ramping up over the past year, I've felt it incredibly difficult to feel anything. Most of the time.

I feel so disconnected from myself. I struggle to take care of my needs. I feel a complete apathy to my own wellbeing, I think at least partially because I find it hard to remind myself that I'm a person at all.

Everyone around me looks so vibrant. I feel lucid as an observer, but I find myself physically forgetting that I'm a person too. 

My own name feels hollow. I find it practically impossible to imagine my future self. My memories of my past feel like I'm remembering a different person.

I have no will or drive to do things any more. I can't focus even on video games, movies, reading. The joy and passion that I used to have just feels absent.

Externally I do my best to stay optimistic, helpful, and seem functional. But I feel like it's nothing more than an act. A coping mechanism to keep myself alive.

Especially with the way the world is going, trans rights taking blows, freedom of information restricting. It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller. Like the world itself is starting to choke at my neck, and I can't breathe any more. 



I know burnout and at least some levels of depression are ""common"" especially with younger generations. But I'm really fighting with the idea of maybe reaching out to try and get some help. But I'm not sure how much of this is in my head, and how much might require actual help.

This isn’t only or mainly about EDs and i don’t go into really any detail, but it was the most fitting tag.
I feel so empty? I don’t feel totally sad tho, just weird like that. I’m bored with everything. Not even the internet is fun anymore. I’d like to just sleep 24/7. I don’t feel depressed tho? i genuinely don’t know. 

Technically i have a lot of not so great shit that went/is going down in my life but it’s all just stuff that i’m used to or kinda accepted so it shouldn’t make me feel like this.
My father is in rehab (again), i’m struggling with two of my friendships, i keep dreaming of bad things, i’m stuck in a binge & restrict cycle, i hate the way i look lately more than usually and i keep thinking and feeling gross about what i used to do with older men online, at the same time i keep missing one of the guys i used to talk to. 
i hate typing that out because i feel like i’m just self pitying honestly.

I don’t know what to end this with or what to ask or anything like that. 
It’s not like anyone can magically “help” me. Maybe i just wanted to type it out, maybe i thought this would help my boredom or maybe i just want to talk to random people on the internet. 

I’m thinking of going to therapy again, but i used up the free sessions you get in my country when you’re young and i don’t want to burden my mom with paying for therapy where i probably won’t even talk about what truly bothers me.

1mccja5,I(35M) am not sure how to navigate my partners(38F) trauma,"We’ve been seeing each other for a year and decided to make it official in March this year. We’ve talked about marriage and moving in together. However…

My partner tragically lost her father in puberty, and developed trauma. The closer we bond, the deeper she pushes me away to avoid losing someone she loves.

She’s aware of her trauma and actively doing therapy.

I try to be as patient as possible and give her a sense of safety the best way I can. Nonetheless, I struggle to understand how to navigate this. The deeper our love, the closer I get, the more fear gets activated and she pushes me back.

She’s a smart and loving woman. Never mean, not manipulative, not testing me, very loyal. I’m aware it will be a ride and I’m in for it.

1mccdbi,Will meds help with my anger?,"So, I’d been on sertraline for some time before I stopped taking it, because I’m bad at taking meds consistently these days. I’d really say I don’t need it other than my bursts of anger.

It’s unusual, but being spoken down to constantly at work, not being able to do certain tasks, etc, leaves me so angry I’m often hitting my desk, myself, I’ve ripped notebooks apart and broken headsets at work without even realising because I’m pulling something too hard. I kept an old broken desk chair now that I’ve replaced it because I knew it would be better than hitting things, but got a bit of a shock when it bent the object I was using to hit because must’ve been going too hard.

I hate it. I’m so overwhelmed by it that I physically can’t hold it in and end up physically hurting myself or damaging things around me, but I’ve never had this problem before, and I don’t know if taking my meds (Zoloft) is actually going to help any or just put me through the awful side effects of starting again for no reason.

Will Zoloft/sertraline help my anger? I originally got it for depression/panic.",1753797980.0,0,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mccdbi/will_meds_help_with_my_anger/,2025-07-29 14:06:20+00:00

I’ve prepared some notes for what I’ll have to say to the person answering, because phone calls stress me out so much.
I thought having a break from work would make me some good, since work has been incredibly stressful lately (new position), but on my first break week I felt miserable the whole time, then I got 3 more stressful weeks, and now i’m on another week of break. 
I’m to the point where I don’t want to do anything, even things that helped me before, like cooking and going to the gym, the two things that helped me get out of my head when I was feeling down before. I also find it difficult to maintain a good work-life balance, and constantly fall behind on chores. Since im on a break the chores are pretty good rn tho, and that’s a little relief in my life.

1mc7lzw,I walk thousands of steps everyday and it's not in my control,"26m, I walk thousands of steps in my room and it's not in my control. I walk so much that my legs start to hurt and I still can't stop. People arround have start to notice and they think somethings wrong with me. My friend once asked ""why I always walk in my room whenever he sees me"" and I was like ""I'm just thinking about something"". But I still can't explain why can't stay still.


       One time in office we were in middle of a team meeting and I started thinking about something. Few minutes later I stood up and started walking in the meeting room in middle of meeting. Everyone just looked at me and were like ""what the hell is he doing?"" I said ""I'm just stretching my legs"" and everyone laughed it off. But really I forgot that I was in a meeting and people were arround me. It was pretty embarrassing for me. Why do I do this? I can understand if I'm doing this due to anxiety but I also do this when I'm not anxious at all. I can never relax on my dayoffs.

1mcc7iy,i enjoy torturing insects and imagining people who hurt me,"This concept is new to me (16f). I don't have the guts to confess it at therapy, but one of my recent hobbies is trapping the giant ants invading my home and watching them for hours, trying to escape, imagining people who have wronged me instead. I enjoy it a lot and I could do it for hours. Even cut some limbs and watch it struggle. It genuinely fills me with satisfaction but soon after I feel extremely bad and even cry. I don't want to be evil but I just do things sometimes

1mcc6h0,Tired of people telling me it's temporary,"I have been so depressed my entire life. Not a day I remember since age 5 where I didn't think of the end. And I have tried every single day to find reasons to keep going so I don't hurt others. I constantly remind myself to try something else, one more day, one more try. But I'm so sick of my depression being framed in terms of how other people might feel. If those people might feel so strongly why then do they not help while I'm still here? Is my pain only important as it relates to others who aren't depressed? 

And I'm so absolutely tired of being told that my depression is temporary. I'm med resistant apparently, most medications I've been on have never had the intended effect. I've been in and out of therapy and psychiatry with more negative impact on my life than positive. And still I try. I was even sent a book where a psychologist writes over and over that most depression ends in a few months or with treatment (the book is good and he's right about a lot of things with regard to other people but the more I read, the more I get the impression that it wasn't written for me). I'm 36 years old, not a full length of life maybe but 31 years of days taken up by wishing to be done is too much. I never asked to exist. Life has been too painful for too long. When my therapist goes home at the end of the day and enjoys time with her family, I'm still alone at home every hour of every day until I see her next, scraping the walls of my skull looking for any motivation to keep going, and coming up short. 

What's the god damn point? I've never had dreams or life goals that mattered long term. When asked I usually just create a 'goal' based on the moment. It never holds. Treatment continues to provide empty promises. Continuing to try, no matter what or how hard, has only prolonged things at best and created even more problems at worst. 

If you're reading this and comparing me to yourself I hope you'll take more cues from someone who's benefited from treatment than from me. I'm not even a good example when I'm doing everything I can. The only future in life that seems likely for me is that I live miserable for the rest of my natural days and frankly, I have little interest in that.

1mc7in1,feeling like a part of my body isn’t mine,"hi i was just very lost and needed to share some thoughts and things i have been dealing with lately and ask what it could be and if i should find a doctor asap or if its not that bad?? im so unsure of what to think

I have been dealing with depression basically since my early teens due to a traumatic event but it was actually getting better. i am now about to turn 23, i am the happiest i have ever been i wouldn’t even say i am depressed but  i have had 2 big crisis that were nothing like i experienced before. i felt brutally pulled out of my body and for the whole day and night, i have been hyper, idk how to describe it but like, i couldnt stop moving around and i felt on fire in a way. im not even sure i knew what i was thinking about during it, i felt totally disconnected from myself, i felt like i had no control on my actions. and during the 2nd one of those crisis i suddenly started to obsess ofer two of my fingers, they felt wrong and i was so sure they weren’t mine like at all. it got so bad that all i could think about was that i needed to find a way to remove them or that the feeling or whatever were inside them would spread on the rest of my hand\arm…. i ended up doing some damage to them but nothing too bad and felt physically exhausted so i fell asleep at 5am and when i woke up i felt like the crisis had stopped.

My issue is, those crisis were so scary to me, i have never experienced that. and since then my extremities like my hands mainly and my legs have started to feel weirdly weak and tingly and i keep hearing the sound of my front door opening or closing\slamming shut. i have also with my body feeling tingly i noticed the floor at times move in a weird way? like waves or just wiggle? sorry i cant find the word i want in english… And also today the feeling about fingers has slowly started to come back i feel like, it has been 1 week since that crisis but i started to focus on them again and they started to bother me and i am scared that it means it will happen again. 

I am sure it sounds dumb and ridiculous but i am genuinely starting to feel like im loosing it. I am conflicted because writing it down i feel like everything is silly and i know those are my fingers for example but it still actively feel like they arent. sorry for that long useless post i had nowhere to put that so i deceded to come on here",1753783760.0,2,2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7in1/feeling_like_a_part_of_my_body_isnt_mine/,2025-07-29 10:09:20+00:00
1mcbxfk,I haven’t left my house in months… how do you rebuild a life when your body reacts like this?,"Sorry for the long post and vocab. I find it hard to communicate.
 
I(26M) have been an ambitious kid since forever. I want to be a filmmaker. Not only that, but i want to have enough wealth that i am able to travel all over the world with my family without any sacrifice, like traveling business class, experiencing the best of the best hotels, food, etc. But with that I'm unwilling to travel. Even the thought of going somewhere gives me severe anxiety that is very unbearable. Even going local my body goes so tense that when i reach back home, body releases relief farts. And when i travel espacially in a car, i have groggy stomach. These feelings have been there since i can't even remember. Initially i wanted to travel the world, become a travel host for some show in fox travels etc. But i don't know how and when i got like these. In contrast to that my parents are very quick on their toes when it comes to traveling. They would be ready for any frequent plans tho my mother doesn't like frequent local outing. Whenever they make any plan i always refuse for which they make fun of me. Sometimes them making plans make me very angry and an uncontrollable anger comes out of nowhere demotivating them. As you know filmmakers require a lot of travelling but since i can't do any, it also makes me anxious for the future. In the past i went to delhi(tier 1 city) for a year leaving my hometown chandigarh(tier 2 city) to pursue my career, but i had to drop everything and come back. Not only psychological but also physical health wise i was incompetent for which i has to face the repercussions in the form of various health problems and deficiencies. But even that time was not able to change me and fix my fear of going out. I used to be very home sick and suffer a lot.
It's been 3 months since i got back from delhi but since then I've hardly left my house 3-4 times, that too for my dental appointment. I suffer from general anxiety 24/7 but this travel anxiety is extreme for me to handle. In addition to that, tho this is just assumption that it might connect. I feel a similar or less like of anxiety when someone, even the regular house help comes at home or people surrounding me in general. The more unfriendly faces i see the more closeted i feel. My behavior changes and i can't wait for everybody to leave or when i am outside the anxiety i feel is significantly reduces when i sit back in my car and is fixed with that relax fart when i reach home. What do you think I can do to fix this?

1mcbule,Pulling back,"I blocked this woman on here that I have been messaging with. Our connection is electric- flirty, interesting, with common hobbies, teasing. She is so intelligent and insightful and funny. She feels it too. At least from what she says. But she has also made it clear she has her own issues to work through and cannot offer much more connection than messages here.  At least for now.

I felt I started to be overwhelming. Messaging her more than she was responding. Being more flirtatious, more complimentary, more romantic with my words. I was composing french poetry. I don’t know how to do either portions of that phrase. It had to be mania. I got worried I would scare her off. So I decided to shield her with this block.

This behavior has to be a mania. I am right now unable to afford or get my meds. No money, no car. I can't see a therapist/psychologist for the same reasons. Due to a previous psychotic episode I just wrapped up some legal issues. It went well. Thankfully. I am struggling with work politics. I have so few irl friends. My ex-husband just moved out. I am having tension with my mother at the same time my father is struggling healthwise. I just realized I was gay in February after a lifetime of intense internalized homophobia. It is a lot so it would make sense I am out of control.

Before I blocked her I sent her a message and left it for about 12 hours. I hope she saw it. I just separated from a codependent marriage of 8 years. To man. Again, I just realized I was gay in February.

When I lay it all out like this, there are so many factors going against me. Against the possibility of pursuing this woman. What I have told and more. I just. My chest hurts with the thought of lossing forever the possibility of having found my person.

I wish I was healthier so I could move forward with my life. So that I could be more present for her. Give her the support and make space for her. She has struggles as well. I would be there for her. But my own issues swirl around me, and I don’t want to throw them on her. I don't know if she can or would want to share my load.",1753796720.0,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcbule/pulling_back/,2025-07-29 13:45:20+00:00
1mcbt9k,Struggling to keep up with daily life,"Hi all, I am a 24F currently working part time and in school full time. My partner 24M is very supportive and we’ve been together for a long time, so they have seen me at my worst and my best. I have been on medication for over 2 1/2 years and the current combo I have for a year. Over the last few months I noticed myself falling deeper into my depression and specifically, anxiety. I have accommodations at my school, so I get some flexibility with my coursework and I’ve been able to keep up with that. However, I am so anxious all the time. I am anxious to go to class, I am anxious about work, I have barely been able to manage going to the grocery store. I take my medications regularly, and on time, but I can’t seem to get past this skin crawling feeling I have all the time. If I don’t feel anxious, I am foggy. Things slip past me and I lose hours of time just curled in a ball on my bed. I’ve neglected my regular hygiene and I just feel so out of my body.

Over the last week, I haven’t been able to sleep, I eat when I feel anxious, and I can’t keep up with my work tasks. At work, I fell behind a few weeks ago and had a meeting with my supervisor. I was able to catch back up, but just recently I missed an important appointment with a client who was already understanding enough to reschedule with me. I had not gotten back to them until today, to which I found out they went to my supervisor about it. I feel ashamed in myself because I had made so much progress in the last two years. I know I am going to be asked what happened, and having to explain my mental health episode just has me on a spiral. I am ashamed to tell my partner I messed up. 

I know I can’t jump to the conclusion that I will be fired, but I already feel so anxious about it since we have already had a discussion about my organization and time management. I have set up an apology and resignation email in case because I don’t think I can handle it. I am just struggling so much more than I wanted to recognize. I need some sort of job to support myself until I finish my degree this spring. I don’t know how to move forward. I feel nauseous all the time and I’m unsure what to do because my medications aren’t working anymore. I just don’t understand how I can make progress and then it’s gone in a span of a few weeks.
