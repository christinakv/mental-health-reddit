1iwvbzn,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",1740377437.0,36,23,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iwvbzn/ranxiety_is_looking_for_new_moderators/,2025-02-24 06:10:37+00:00

1md3ved,Anxiety is ruining my life,"I've always had really bad social anxiety, but it's just gotten so much worse over the years. I've tried to everything to keep it in check but it's not getting any better. It's made normal daily activities so hard for me. Just going to university and even working is incredibly draining. I have tried therapy but nothing has worked. 

I keep trying to tell myself that no one cares, but in my head I feel like the entire world is judging me. I had stomach aches before I go into work because I hate it. I stay up all night dreading the next day of work or praying for it to be Friday already. I never made any friends at university because I barely went in. Being able to have fun during the week and see friends to take away the stress of work is so important, and because I don't have that, I feel so miserable. Everyday I contemplate quitting my job but the job market is a disaster. 

Can anyone provide any advice on how they deal with anxiety. I thought I'd grow out of it, but everything is still the same, nothing has changed.

1mcc3he,Did you know anxiety actually comes with some surprising benefits?,"I used to think my anxiety made me weak… until I came across some wild research that flipped that narrative.

A study using a real-life “shoot/don’t shoot” simulation showed that people with high anxiety:

* Were more accurate at distinguishing between threats and innocents
* Had better shooting precision than those without anxiety (Yeah… anxiety turning us into warriors wasn’t on my bingo card either.)

Another study found that anxious people tend to handle crises better, they're more alert, responsive, and come out safer than laid-back folks in high-stakes situations.

One even suggested that adolescents with anxiety are more likely to survive past 25 than those without it. Something about heightened awareness and cautious decision-making.

And get this: according to Harvard’s Cass Sunstein, anxious leaders:

* Are more flexible
* Better at active listening
* And come up with creative solutions under pressure

So if you’ve been feeling broken or less-than because of your anxiety, I hope this gives you a new lens.  
It’s not just a curse.  
Sometimes, it’s your superpower, misunderstood, but real.

What do you guys think? ",1753797325.0,348,38,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcc3he/did_you_know_anxiety_actually_comes_with_some/,2025-07-29 13:55:25+00:00
1mcsi9f,Lexapro changed my life,"I avoided going on medication for a really, really long time. I grew up in a home that didn’t believe in psych meds, said they were poison, etc. Even though I didn’t believe that, I still was so scared that I would change, that I would never have libido, that my anxiety was really just “helping” me. I started lexapro around 6 months ago, on a low dose, and it’s genuinely changed everything. I can SLEEP! I can finally go to bed without spiraling for hours about whether or not I’ll wake up, praying obsessively about the state of the world, etc. I still get stressed but I almost never get thrown into those awful thought loops and get immediately intensely overwhelmed, like I used to daily. I leave the house a lot, I walk my dog without feeling like everyone is looking at me. My libido hasn’t changed and I can orgasm fine, just takes a tiny bit longer (kinda a plus honestly). The only downside for me is that I can feel pretty sleepy often, but I think that’s fine considering the alternative… I also get extremely vivid, long, plot-heavy dreams which is weird but not really bad. 
Anyway, if you’re really struggling and scared of medication but are curious, I encourage you to at least try. Im so grateful I eventually took the leap. You can always stop if it isn’t right for you :-)",1753835867.0,45,8,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcsi9f/lexapro_changed_my_life/,2025-07-30 00:37:47+00:00

1mcx136,How do you get to sleep when a panic attack seems to always hit before bed?,"Ive been recently having panic attacks nearly every night right before I go to bed. It's not every night, usually when I have to go to work the next day.

I have cloazapam that I was told to take 0.25 mg every day, and if I have a severe panic attack or something stressful coming up I can take another. It works better than any ssri I've ever taken for controlling day to day anxiety, but it does absolutely butt fuck all for my panic attacks. 

As I said they usually happen when I need to go to bed, and my usual coping strategies are a bit hard for bed time. I can't go for a run while trying to sleep or take a shower or listen to history videos (well last one I could but I share my bed)
I've tried breathing exercises but they rarely do much. Maybe im doing them wrong but I always end up feeling short of breath after them 

I've had some luck with doing puzzles in my head but that doesn't always help either as while the anxiety goes away it tends to keep me awake",1753849149.0,17,13,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcx136/how_do_you_get_to_sleep_when_a_panic_attack_seems/,2025-07-30 04:19:09+00:00

For me

. Going on a short walk in the morning, even if I look like I just rolled out of bed.

. Making my bed (sounds small but weirdly helps).

. Taking 5 minutes in the evening to do absolutely nothing no phone, no music, just sit.

1mcqbnj,Job/Career anxiety has ruined my life,"2 years ago, at the pathetic age of 45, I was finally hired for my first full-time job, and in my field of study.  I had years of interviews that never went anywhere.  I convey nervousness too easily and interviewers no doubt picked up on that.  I sound inarticulate and rushed.  I rehearse my answers, but then the interviewer asks a question I’m not prepared for, and then I get flustered.  The moment the interview starts I just want it to end.  I also needed relevant experience, but employers only hired people with experience – a story as old as time.  I was content with my part-time job for many years because I felt it was all I could handle.  Somehow though, I was finally hired for this full-time job.

2 months ago, my full-time job ended as the company ceased operations.  The pay could’ve been better, but I would’ve been content working for this company until retirement, without a raise and in-office 5 days a week because it was a steady paycheck with benefits.  And I never would’ve interviewed with anyone ever again.  Unfortunately, the company sustained so much financial loss it couldn’t continue.

And part of me is like, this is the only type of company that would hire me: A fucked-up, disorganized company with huge financial losses that’s completely unsustainable.

Fast forward to today.  I’ve had about 10 interviews in the past 2 months and it’s the same story.  I suck at interviews.  Companies just ghost you now if they’re not interested.  I was supposed to interview with a company this morning in-person with 3 people.  When I walked into the building, I had a full-blown panic attack that I immediately turned around to go home.  I know, I blew it but fuck it.

When my unemployment runs out, I think I want it to be over.  I don’t want to relive 2001-2022, which seems inevitable.  I don’t want to be a drain on my aging parents again.  The only friends I have are those I met through my girlfriend; I’ve never made any friends on my own.  She’d be better without me, and so would my parents.  Nobody would miss me. 

In a world where your worth is determined by what you do for a living and how much you earn, people like me are worthless.

I’ve spoken to my hospital doctors and everything and they have only Just now started to do tests for context I’m a 16 F I know it’s rare but it can happen and all I’m seeing constantly are the stories where people don’t live and it’s really ruining me I’ve been told to have a blood tests which I’ve had today and then I’m having a ultrasound but from learning about stomach cancer apparently the only way it would be found is an endoscopy which they are so hesitant to do on me because of my age and with the pains I’m my colon do I even ask for colonoscopy

I can’t find happiness in anything anymore and for some reason it may sound weird but I just feel like I’m dying slowly everyday I look more pale my weights dropped I keep being sick everyday and to make things worse I had plans for the future and I wanted to get married have a good job a house go to collage and do hairdressing and I’m so afraid I won’t get to do that

1md5ffq,I am going crazy,"Hi everyone. I am 22 yo F. 
So basically, the title says it all.
Please don't laugh at me or judge me.  I'm seriously going crazy.
I lost my mom to lung cancer three months ago, and since then, my life has completely changed and become filled with stress. I've barely been sleeping and have really bad anxiety.
Again, please don't laugh at me, but sometimes I have obsessive thoughts that I might have brain cancer.
My symptoms are brain fog, and sometimes my face feels numb - not like a stroke or anything, just like l've been lying on it too long? I know that might sound weird. I can still feel everything, talk, smile, laugh but sometimes my face still feels a little off.
I also get dizziness and occasional nausea (I've developed some minor stomach issues because of stress and poor eating habits).When I feel dizzy, I can still express myself, understand what people are saying, read, write, and interact like normal. I'm active, my  bf and I go hiking, swimming, to the beach, etc. I haven't lost any weight.
I can't see a doctor right now because I just started a new job and my health insurance won't kick in for another 60 days.
I really believe that these obsessive thoughts are connected to the trauma of losing my mom. We were extremely close, she was my best friend... Losing her to cancer just made it worse. I barely sleep, and the anxiety is overwhelming.
I don't know what to do, but these thoughts are exhausting and making everything so much harder.",1753878955.0,2,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md5ffq/i_am_going_crazy/,2025-07-30 12:35:55+00:00
1md5cb7,3-month LDN trial - please help if you have taken LDN,"Hi folks, apologies in advance for the long-winded post. Would greatly appreciate any insight you can provide (questions at end).

**Context:**
- **LDN trial duration:** currently at ~12 weeks.
- **Dosing schedule:** 1 week 1.5mg (once daily) > 11 weeks 3mg (once daily).
- **Conditions:** **GAD**, **Depression**, ADHD, Endometriosis, Environmental Allergies, Chronic Rhinosinusitis, TMJ, Sleep Apnea, Bruxism.
- **LDN treatment goal:** improve mental health (conditions bolded above), improvement of other conditions a bonus.
- **Benefits observed:** improved sleep onset and continuity (i.e. fall asleep more easily/stay asleep more frequently), decreased jaw muscle pain.
- **Ongoing side effects/drawbacks:** worsened energy levels (despite sleep benefits), lower/flat mood, weird dreams (not a major issue), had some initial side effects (e.g. GI stuff) but that resolved with time.

**Info:**
- Have added excerpt from the LDN Research Trust prescriber guide below for Anxiety/Depression.

*Anxiety/Depression: Most mental health patients respond well to multiple doses of 0.06 mg/kg/bw, about 3 to 6 mg each dose, and many notice no benefit until they reach the 6 mg dose level. LDN must be used strategically in a manner that disrupts and suppresses the opioid system-based dissociation underlying these disorders. This disruption/suppression depends on maintaining a relatively constant serum blood level of LDN, which may require up to 2-3 doses taken during waking hours.*

https://ldnresearchtrust.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/Dosing-Guide-2024_0.pdf

**Questions:**
*Note, would appreciate answers to any of the below if you also have similar experiences/conditions/LDN treatment goals.*
- Have/did you persist beyond ~3 months at a given dose experiencing same/similar issues and they eventually resolved? If so, how long did it take and when did benefits kick in?
- Understand that the recommendation might be to reduce dose if having negative effects such as those listed above. Did this work for you? How did you go about this? (e.g. down to 1.5mg for x weeks until x resolved > 2.0mg for x weeks etc.)
- Considering the guideline above, did you find that 3mg (or similar dose) wasn’t working for you/caused bad effects so you increased to 6mg and this helped?
- Did you experience a difference/improvement going from once daily dosing to 2-3 times a day? What did that look like?
- At what point did you accept LDN isn’t right for you?
- Any other relevant stories that you think might be helpful.

If you have made it this far, thank you.",1753878717.0,2,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md5cb7/3month_ldn_trial_please_help_if_you_have_taken_ldn/,2025-07-30 12:31:57+00:00
1mcz7m5,I’m not able to enjoy my life anymore,"I was in therapy for several years and it helped me overcome a lot of my executive dysfunction but my debilitating anxiety has lingered despite repeated attempts by my therapist to help me work on it. I stopped therapy last summer because I felt that I had essentially “peaked” in therapy - it was a plateau with no more improvement. 

My anxiety is so strong and overpowering these days that I am unable to sleep until my mind and body are so worn from my anxious thoughts that they shut down. I wake up every day exhausted. 

I am on an SSRI that helps with depression, my support network knows about my mental health issues, and I try my best to implement my coping mechanisms. 

Yet, I am unable to win the battle against my thoughts. I am truly convinced, through my own logical justifications, that my fears are rational. I find myself struggling to relate to those who don’t have anxiety about the things that I do. My family’s frustration in response to my constant reassurance-seeking feels like a betrayal; how can they not see what I see, even when I explain it to them logically?

I’m about to start grad school next month and I worry that my anxiety will devastate my ability to succeed.

1md547q,Just some thoughts on Anxiety,"This is for the people who say things like “Anxiety is in your head”, “I’ve dealt with anxiety before” or how bout these assholes that say “Anxiety isn’t real” to you I say F you! 
Anxiety isn’t a matter of perspective or “mood” true sufferers of anxiety Will try to explain it until we are all blue in the face but the fact is unless you’re living with it no one understands what you mean and that’s ok. 
For me anxiety is a crippling punch to the gut that leaves me breathless, frozen and filled with dread, unable to even leave my house. Some people will read this and roll their eyes or blow it off and that’s fine , I’m happy that you live without anxiety and don’t have to constantly worry about the next panic attack. Some may say I’m overthinking or over exaggerating my symptoms and I would love to give that person just one of my panic attacks and sit back with popcorn while their once perfect life crumbles. Unfortunately, I understand it so I would help them however I could. 
I guess I’m writing this to vent my frustration with my anxiety but it’s more than that. I’m fucking tired of people’s comments and not having the slightest understanding, some even  accusing me of lying! it’s 2025 and as a society we don’t understand anxiety yet we make laws so children can castrate themselves at the age of 9 bc it’s trendy! 
I’ve dealt with anxiety, panic disorder whichever you choose since I was 10, that was 1991 and no one knew what anxiety disorder was. I’m not asking for everyone to understand bc people are assholes now a days and are only looking out for themselves but don’t assume you know what that person is going through bc you’re not perfect either. 

To everyone suffering with anxiety, no matter how bad, Know you’re not alone. There is help and it’s going to take some work but don’t give up! Comeback stronger! I know it’s not easy and some days it will get the best of you but tomorrow is another day. Stay strong and

1mcdluk,I can’t sleep because I’m plagued by the knowledge my parents will one day die,"I’m 28. My parents are getting up there in years. 75,76 respectively. They’re not in the greatest of health either. One day they will die and the older they get the worse my anxiety gets. I moved closer to them (12 hours away to 10 min away) to try to alleviate this anxiety. Thinking if I spend more time with them I’ll feel better. But no. I haven’t slept well in weeks. Because every night it’s just the thought of *they’ll be gone soon* over and over.

I feel like I’m on a train track and I can see the train coming and I know it will hit me but I don’t know when.

1md6tgt,"OCD, Social Anxiety, Self-Compassion","So I’ve been seeing a therapist for almost a year now (and man, did I put that off way longer than I needed to!). Initially we thought I had OCD because I have a lot of unhealthy obsessive thoughts, many of them irrational (eg while flying on a plane I’d have the obsession that I could open the emergency exit. Not that I want to, just that I could). Lately we’ve come to realize that there’s also a very heavy social anxiety component too. I have a tendency to obsess over conversations, plan them out over and over in my head, and also just dwell on conversations I had (did I say something wrong? Offensive?). Were thinking that part of the problem (or a large part, as it may be) is personal inadequacy issues, worried I’m going to be embarrassed or someone isn’t going to like me. So while I’m working on better treatment for OCD too, I’m looking also now at self-compassion as a way to improve social anxieties.

1mcm1mw,My Zoloft Story,"My Zoloft/Sertraline Success Story

I want to start by saying that I know how many of you are feeling when starting Zoloft (sertraline). I am a 24-year-old female, and when I started, I was so scared. My doctor didn’t give me much information before I dove in, and I felt like I was walking into the unknown.

The first three days felt fine and then it hit me. For about six days, I was nauseous, sad, and didn’t want to eat or leave my room. I felt discouraged, let down, and I wanted to give up. Like many people, I turned to Reddit, and reading horror stories only made me feel worse.

One thing changed everything. I talked to my godmother, who struggles with anxiety and depression like I do. She told me, “Don’t give up.” As hard as it was, I listened to her. By the time I hit the two-week mark, I felt 100 times better. I still had my moments, but overall, things were improving.

Six months in, my life looked completely different. I could socialize without panicking, I wasn’t exhausted all the time, and I finally felt like myself again. My biggest fears like planes, social events, long car rides, work, and school started to feel manageable.

Now, at one year on Zoloft (100mg), I can honestly say I’m a different person. I fly to visit my brother in another state at least once a month. I adopted a cat. I moved out with my boyfriend. I go to concerts, grocery stores, and even travel solo. I started a new job.

Zoloft also changed my relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for seven years, and even though he is incredibly understanding, my anxiety put a strain on us. Now, I can enjoy life with him without constant panic attacks ruining our plans.

I just want everyone to know that it absolutely gets better. Everyone’s experience is different, but my biggest advice is to start slow. If possible, begin with half the prescribed dose and increase it every five days. It makes the transition so much easier on your body and mind.

A year ago, I never would have had the confidence to write something like this, but here I am. I lost so many years of my life to anxiety and fear, but I am finally living again, and I am so grateful I stuck with it

1md5yol,How to get over college nerves as a 25 year old returning student?,"Hi all, as the title says; I am a 25 year old headed back to college!

For context: I got an Associates in an Art *(graduated when Covid first hit...as if securing a job in an art wasn't hard enough lol)*. So long story short, I've never been able to use that degree

I was 20 when I got that degree \^ and it's taken me 5 years since to decide on what career I'd want.

I'm heading to college to become a Secondary English teacher! (7th-12th grade).

This course is VERY hands on, we have a mandatory student teacher club, as well as getting hours in the field FIRST SEMESTER.  
Since I had some credits that were transferable; my advisor is trying to fast track me in the program. I'm taking 2 classes in the teacher course this semester. 1 is a class I'd have to take in my first semester to get a feel for if I'd like to teach; including hours in the field and lesson planning, etc. The other class is a class I'd usually take my 2nd year in that also includes in field hours - aka this is usually taken a few semesters after the class that helps students get a feel for if they'd truly like to teach.

So I'm feeling very nervous. My anxiety is making me think ""Well what if I get a feel for teaching and decide that I DONT want to teach? But now I have extra teacher classes and more time in field to do my first semester back?""

Also,  
My bf and I took a trip to my campus where him and I toured my classrooms - which made it feel a lot more real, and I was fighting panic. I felt overwhelmed about this 4 year commitment of schooling after so long of not being in school. I had to take an intermediate algebra course this summer to prep me for college algebra because it's just been so long that I don't remember a lot about being a student/studying/how things in certain classes work anymore.

HOWEVER, I am at my limit working dead end food service/customer service jobs while being severely underpaid. And I sat myself down to think about what I'd like to do for my career.

I've always wanted to teach English but was too nervous to pursue it.

I always seem to let my anxiety allow me to run away instead of pushing through it to get what I want. And it seems like my anxiety is trying to do that to me AGAIN. Class starts end of August, and I'm not going to allow myself to run.....

BUTTTTT

**How do I deal with the nerves as I'm waiting?**

1md5wts,Over-the-counter meds for anxiety (esp. before travel): are they legit or just placebo?,"TL;DR: Are there any over-the-counter medications that actually help with anxiety and sleep, or is it just throwing money away?

Every year, when I have to catch a night flight, it's always the same story: zero sleep due to a mix of anxiety, excitement, worry, and overthinking. This year I need to wake up at 3AM, so ideally I'd go to sleep early-but I already know I won't be able to.

And once I arrive at my destination, the new bed + whatever else usually means I sleep poorly there too. A few years ago, I literally got 0 minutes of sleep the night before departure, and only managed 3 hours on the first night at the destination-3 hours of sleep in 48 hours.

This year I want to avoid repeating that nightmare. Since I've got even more on my mind, I expect it to be worse. I'm already following the usual tips (no screens before bed, etc.), but I'm also considering some over-the-counter supplement that I can bring on the plane without any hassle.

Any suggestions? I'm worried that melatonin alone won't help with anxiety, so I was looking into a product that combines melatonin + valerian + griffonia (5-HTP) + california poppy (eschscholzia). But I'm also afraid it's a waste of money and won't help me sleep anyway.

1md5ohw,I think I have POCD and I’m scared.. :(,"Hello.. my apologies if this is too long, I’m trying to explain my self the best I can.. I’ll try to make sure it has proper wording.. I’m a 19yo male, turning 20 pretty soon..

Whenever I see a small underaged child or a underaged person, my brain is continuously saying in the background.. “do not look at their private parts, butt, feet or hands area at all.. actually don’t even look at them at all to be extra safe, and also don’t get sexually aroused either..” and so theres so much extreme pressure for me to follow all those rules and once I break any of them my brain is then like.. “oh there it is!.. you are a pedophile!.. there is the proof!..” but I know I’m not a pedophile.. and it’s the worst feeling when I get sexually aroused.. sometimes I even quickly break all those rules to show my brain that there is NO intentions at all because there isn’t and also so my brain would stop and leave me alone.. but then that makes it all worse because then my brain is like.. “uhhh why did you just look there?!.. or why did you just get sexually aroused?!.. or both!.. you are a pedophile!.. there is the proof!..” or sometimes I intentionally try to get a good look at someone for absolutely NO reason and I have NO intentions AT ALL!.. like literally the actual answer to why I did that is genuinely.. “I don’t know..” like literally!..
or I see someone and it could be literally anyone.. and my brain is so quick to say.. “oh that person is attractive..” or “oh that person is ugly..” and then I’m like.. “oh god here we go again now I have to research how old they are in that photo..” and sometimes it does all that for people where I notice I ALREADY KNOW they are all underaged.. so then after that then I’m forcing myself to get EXTRA EXTRA confirmation on it all.. and I just feel HORRIBLE after.. or sometimes I have my hand or hands in my pants fidgeting with my private parts, and there is genuinely NO sexual intentions in any way shape or form when I do that.. but depending on what I am looking at while I do any and all that, my brain will correspondingly accuse me of something HORRIBLE.. and then I feel HORRIBLE.. or sometimes I’m battling intrusive thoughts, voices, emotions and feelings constantly while I do something random with NO intentions.. and my brain tries to turn it into something different.. like I can’t do anything because I don’t know anything.. and sometimes if I break any of those rules while looking at something I will force myself to look at it and show my brain that there is NO intentions AT ALL, because there isn’t any intentions AT ALL.. but then that also makes it all worse because my brain is like.. “uhh why are you looking at all this?!.. oh!.. you are sexually aroused to it again!.. or both!.. see you are a pedophile!!.. there is the proof!!..” 

And on top of ALL that I also have to deal with intrusive thoughts, voices, emotions and feelings constantly 24/7 questioning me and making me constantly think over and over again and trying to get a 100% solid answer for every single little thing that happens or that has ever happened..

I’ve already accepted the WORST that I ever could have been back then in my past was a pedophile who never sexually assaulted ANYONE as I’ve literally been inside for the past 5 years and I didn’t like 
to be seen or even looked at by people who weren’t my family.. and now I also don’t like people who aren’t my family see me or even look at me.. and also, even NOW me simply typing and saying I might have been a pedophile back then makes feels really weird.. I seriously refuse to believe I was a pedophile back then.. there is just no way.. right?!.. 

And I think I’ve seen someone say that people who are pedophiles are always going to be pedophiles even if they get therapy or help.. they just get help with managing their urges and not acting on them.. so if I was a pedophile back then wouldn’t that still make me a pedophile now?!.. but NOW I’m not even a pedophile in any way shape or form AT ALL, and I know all that..

And still my brain will make up a million things for “what if this” or “what if that” and all I can say in response is.. “WHY when I was 14 or 15 years old back in 2020 would I say anything sexual with a or to a 11 OR 12 YEAR OLD BOY?.. while in ALL those discord calls with him back then after we BOTH met or knew each other on the same Minecraft server we BOTH played on.. and WHY when I was 14 or 15 years old back in 2020 would I say anything sexual with or to ALL AND ANY of those random people while in ALL those discord calls with ALL of them back then after we ALL met or knew each other on the same Minecraft server we ALL played on..”

WHY would I do any of that?!.. 

And then when I do forget about all that, and all the emotions and feelings go away, my brain is like.. “oh, so you think you can forget about being a pedophile and all the horrible pedophile stuff you did to other people?!..” and I’m like.. “I have been inside for the past 5 years!!..” all the other stuff I said above basically.. I get stuck in a loop of me explaining everything to my brain when I KNOW I am actually not a pedophile in any way shape or form AT ALL, and I KNOW I am actually innocent for ALL that “what if you did this but NOW you forgot about all that?!..” or “what if you did that but NOW you forgot about all that?!..” stuff my brain ALL makes up in my head and makes me ALL worried for..



Is there any advice i could get for managing this all?.. thank you.

1md1d6m,Fear of happiness? Anyone relate?,"I have bad anxiety and I constantly worry about future. My mind can pickup anything from health worries, into world end. Bottom line is, there is always some things looming that I am afraid of.

I think I have some OCD type of behaviour where I try to control those fears with worrying. Resulting in my mind thinking: ""If I worry and play these bad scenarios, maybe they do not happen..""

  
This means that I am afraid to think positive. I genuinely am afraid that if I let go of worrying and think positive, it will result in catastrophy. That my thoughts actually change the future. I know that it does not make sense but still struggle to heal. 

An example could be fear of flying for example. I always feel nervous about flying. I pray in the plane and just worry about plane crashing. I am afraid that If I would stop worrying and say to myself that it will go well, that will actually make the plane crash. So me worrying is keeping the plane safe.

I've been having issues with health anxiety for months now and it's really negatively affecting my life now.
I very regularly get the sensation of air caught in my throat making me think that I can't breathe properly, bruise often and easily, occasionally get petechiae on my arms, have shaky hands, and feel fatigued most days which makes me think that I have leukaemia despite the fact that I had blood testing done and my test results came back completely normal.
My doctor put my symptoms down to anxiety but I can't stop myself worrying and at this stage I think that people are lying to me when they tell me that my symptoms are normal, anxiety related, or aren't anything to be concerned about and I don't like it.

1md4smi,How to deal with emotional numbness?,"Hi!

I’ve got anxiety, but I’m relatively okay right now (I’ve never had panic attacks, I’m okay with going out and engaging in social activities, I’m not scared of anything in particular, I can do more or less everything that needs to be done, and I don’t have any physical symptoms either), but I’m totally numb. Most of the time, I literally don’t feel anything. Ok, sometimes I feel hungry, tired, upset, angry or a tiny amount of satisfaction or pleasure (e.g. after physical activities), but I can’t feel excitement, happiness, curiosity, surprise or anything like that. This is something that’s bugging me, because this makes it extremely hard for me to make plans, to get active, to make friends etc., because I just can’t genuinely care about anything, and I can’t enjoy anything. So, for example I’m okay with talking to people, but it’s extremely tiresome since I constantly have to monitor myself so that I can give the right reactions (smile, laugh, shock etc.) because it just doesn’t come for me naturally. Or, I’m doing sports, but I can’t enjoy that either (just the physical sensation), so it’s hard for me to actually get up and go (and the same applies to other hobbies that I used the enjoy).

I used to be a highly sensitive person, I was interested in a wide range of topics, activities etc., but now I just exist as if I was a piece of cardboard or something. I don’t have much excitement going on in my life right now (I’m currently unemployed living with my parents in a small town, I’m single, I don’t have close friends etc.), but it doesn’t make any difference if I go out and do something “fun” (like I just came back from a festival, which was again just “meh”). I’m moving to the capital in September because I’m starting another uni program, and I hope it’ll be worth it in terms of my mental health and emotional well being as well, but I’m just not sure what I should do about this.

I’ve been trying therapy (psychologists and psychiatrists as well), but it didn’t seem to help much, sometimes I felt that they didn’t even understand my problems (because I didn’t want to hurt myself, I had no panic attacks etc., as if I was not in a worse enough position). I’ve never been diagnosed with anything else other than anxiety, and I’ve never tried meds as no one has ever advised me to do so (other than people on the internet or some of my acquaintances who were also on meds). So, I’m confused.

What do you think, what would help me? Do you have similar experience?",1753877150.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md4smi/how_to_deal_with_emotional_numbness/,2025-07-30 12:05:50+00:00
1md4mi2,Ectopics (skipped beats) causing anxiety — Holter found almost nothing despite clear sensations,"Ectopic beats have been a source of anxiety for me, especially since I had a myocarditis about 15 years ago. Ever since then, I’ve been hyper-aware of my heart rhythm, and any irregularities tend to worry me more than they probably should.

I had my 24-hour Holter monitor on yesterday and today. I was hoping to finally “catch” some of the odd sensations I’ve been noticing - yesterday while carrying my daughter, and again today during a run (felt it about 3–4 times).

But according to my doctor, there were no ectopics during those episodes. He only found 8 ectopic beats total, all of them during the night, which he said is totally normal.

What surprised me is that I was sure I felt something. I usually know how ectopics feel - I’ve caught a few at rest before using my smartwatch (which were later confirmed as PACs/PVCs). So I really thought I’d recognise the sensation again, especially during physical activity - but apparently not this time.

According to ChatGPT, what I felt might’ve just been normal sinus rhythm with slight variations (from movement, breathing, etc.) that can feel “off” but aren’t actual ectopics.

Has anyone else had a similar experience — feeling skipped or irregular beats, but nothing showing on the Holter at that moment?

It loops over and over non stop for days on occasion until its too much and it feels like a world ending thing. 

The only thing that stops the loop is us fighting or her telling me im starting to act weird. Which I guess puts my brain into fix things mode instead of everything is wrong mode.

The things I think about could be as simple as not saying good morning while being half asleep still. Something that isn't bad at all but by the end of the day ill be convinced that means things are over because I thought about it enough adding new things to the thought process. 

It goes from ""She didnt say good morning or kiss me. Thats a little odd."" To ""She must be mad at me. Even when tired she still does it."" To ""I did do this a day or two ago. Maybe thats why."" To ""This happened last year where I said something stupid and that probably started the chain that lead to us breaking up now because she didnt say good morning."" Literally insane banter!

I used to be on medication for years but stopped because I went through i think 7-8 medications, 3-4 dosages of each, and years of therapy.

I'm too scared to do *anything.* I can't even make phone calls myself, my mom has to do it for me. I can sometimes, but I feel like it shouldn't be such an issue at all. I don't leave the house except once a week for therapy, I don't have friends in my state - only online friends, I don't know how to drive, I've never had a job, I dropped out of school. I'm failing at everything, but I always knew this was gonna happen. I've been terrified of growing up since I was six and started second grade. Because I know I can't do it. I don't feel normal. I don't feel capable of doing things everybody does.

I'm also autistic and have situational/selective mutism. Which doesn't help.

I'm trying to try. But that's where I've been stuck at. I have a plan, I know I wanna get my GED, go to college, and I know what career I want to pursue. But I'm terrified of actually doing it. I'm still building up the courage to even try. I just don't think I can. I can't even get a temporary job until I graduate and shit. I can't do it. And whats the point anyway? Yeah, I've made it this far so maybe I could keep going, but why? It's been hell. My whole life has been hell because I'm afraid of *everything.*

I just want to give up. Everyone always says ""its normal"" ""I'm 30/40/50/whatever and still feel that way"" as if thats supposed to be reassuring. It's just proving to me that it doesn't get better. My parents are proof that it doesn't get better. I just wish I was never born tbh. I'm not good at being a person.

I feel hopeless. My therapist keeps trying to reassure me, but I don't know if I can do this. I think some people just can't. And nobody wants to talk about that. Everyone says ""you'll be fine, you're young, you're just figuring things out still."" but what if I'm never fine?

I feel like I should at least be able to do *something* normal. I should've graduated, or learned to drive, or gotten a job. It doesn't have to be all three at the same time, but couldn't I at least do one? Nope.

I still feel like I'm 15. I went through something really traumatic when I was 15, and I feel like I've been stuck there mentally ever since. And now I'm expected to grow up and do all these things but I still feel like a broken child.

My family keeps pushing me, but it doesn't feel supportive or encouraging, it feels like overwhelming pressure.

1md3cup,Buspirone's Effect on Early Morning Wakefulness and Evening Racing Thoughts – Strategies for Dealing with This?,"Hey everyone,

For the past few months, I’ve been dealing with early morning awakenings, which weren’t an issue before. At first, it was a mild form – waking up maybe an hour or two earlier than usual, but I could fall back asleep easly. However, since I started taking buspirone, this has become a bigger problem. Now, when I wake up early, I can't fall back asleep, and this leaves me feeling fatigued during the day. Nights have also become more difficult due to this issue.

One additional problem is evening racing thoughts – my thoughts tend to spiral around things I would normally let go of, and now, due to the buspirone, that mental loop feels like it never stops. And also, strangely, they are related to sexually explicit images. Like, I could vividly see disturbing sexual acts just pooping out in my mind like crazy.

I’ve tried some strategies for better sleep and managing early wakefulness (like improving my nightly routine, cutting down on stimulants like coffe before bed, etc.), but with little success. Has anyone experienced this with buspirone and early wakefulness? What strategies have you used to deal with situations like this? Any help is greatly appreciated!

1md2f3p,Struggling with severe health anxiety — how do you cope? Please help,"I’m a 26-year-old male (86 kg), and I’ve been living with severe health anxiety since my first panic attack in 2018. Before that day, I had no idea what panic attacks even felt like.

That first panic attack completely changed my life — I spent the next three months constantly afraid I was about to die from a heart attack. I’d get intense chest pain and palpitations that would change every few hours:
	•	Sharp pain in my chest,
	•	Tightness in my left arm,
	•	Squeezing pain that would travel from the front of my chest to my back.

Every single time, I convinced myself I was having a heart attack. I’ve lost count of the trips to A&E (ER) I’ve made since 2018. They’ve done ECGs, X-rays, blood work — and every time the doctors say, “Your heart is fine.”

But no matter how many times I hear that, when the symptoms come back mainly palpitations, my brain goes: “This time it’s different — you need to call an ambulance.” It’s exhausting. Majority of the time this happens just before I go to bed 

What I’ve tried so far:
	•	I’ve lost over 20 kg in the past few years,
	•	I walk 10–20k steps every day,
	•	I go to the gym twice a week,
	•	I try to live as healthy as possible and I don’t smoke or use any recreational drugs 

But none of this stops my mind from going into overdrive every time I feel a twinge or pain or even palpitation. Recently, I’ve even been experiencing shortness of breath (again, checked at A&E and by my GP — and I was told I’m fine).

This anxiety comes in phases:
	•	It starts out of nowhere, lasts a month or two,
	•	Then it completely fades away for almost a year,
	•	Then suddenly, it’s back again.

At this point, it’s affecting my sleep, my work, my relationships, and my ability to make decisions as I’m in constant fear of dying all the time. I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle where the only relief I get is going to A&E, which is obviously not sustainable.

If you’ve dealt with health anxiety, how did you break free from it?
	•	Did you find a way to stop your brain from constantly thinking “what if this time is different”?

Any advice, personal experiences, or coping strategies would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading this. ❤️",1753869257.0,1,1,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md2f3p/struggling_with_severe_health_anxiety_how_do_you/,2025-07-30 09:54:17+00:00
1mcqsbn,Spouse with anxiety asking for divorce,"My husband has anxiety and is asking for a separation. This isn’t the first time, maybe the 5th or 6th. He never has a reason (like no infidelity or fighting) and still wants to live with me, but doesn’t want to be a couple anymore. He will text me and make jokes, but won’t hug or sleep with me. The last time this happened, he worked through therapy and we reconciled. I just enrolled him back in therapy. 

My questions… is this going to be the rest of my life? Every 6-12 months asking for divorce? What else can I do to support him? At what point do I break down and realize I have self worth and deserve someone that wants to love me like I love them. My love is unconditional but this is starting to impact my mental health. It’s also so hard living in a home where I can’t be intimate with my spouse (even hugging or kissing).

After spending the entire day at the hospital running tests everything came back clean and the doctor said I fall under the “low risk chest pain” category which falls under chest sprains, pulls, anxiety, etc 

I wish this made me feel better about it as the tightness is still very much here it feels like I have a bowling ball on my chest at all times

And the jump up to 40mg is gonna make my anxiety and symptoms so much worst for the next few weeks that I’m genuinely scared

1md1ez4,General health anxiety journey,"
Hey everyone,
This is something I wish I’d seen weeks ago — so I’m writing it for anyone out there suffering silently. This is my real, raw journey of health anxiety, from day 1 to today, including my experience with Placida (Flupentixol + Melitracen) and the strange breathing obsession I’ve been dealing with.



Where it began (trigger incident):

It started in may 24 with something so random I was playing football when I suddenly became hyper-aware of my heartbeat. It felt too strong, and my brain immediately went so much weird adrenaline rushed I rushed to the ER nothing was diagnosed done ECG was normal


“What if it’s a heart problem?”



From there, everything spiraled. I developed cardiophobia — the constant fear that something was wrong with my heart, even after multiple clean tests (ECG, echo, blood work, etc.).



Downward spiral:


Palpitations

Chest heaviness

Breathing tightness

Random limb numbness

Dizziness

Head pressure

Panic attacks (especially before sleep)

Constant ""what if I die suddenly?""



Google searches made it worse. Every skipped beat or head rush sent me into a tailspin.



Started Placida (Flupentixol + Melitracen):

My therapist prescribed Placida, which contains Flupentixol (antipsychotic) + Melitracen (tricyclic antidepressant). I started on a full tablet, then tapered to a half.

What it did:


Reduced intrusive health fears

Helped me sleep

Blunted panic spikes



But I also started feeling detached, overly calm, and eventually decided (with supervision) to taper off the medicine.



The withdrawal shock:

Once I tapered off Placida, new symptoms hit me hard, especially this one:

🔹 Manual breathing / loose breathing — I became obsessed with every breath.
It felt like:


I wasn’t breathing automatically

My breath felt “too easy,” “hollow,” or not reaching my chest

I had to control each inhale or I’d stop breathing

Air hunger, but not in the lungs — more like in the awareness



That turned into:


Throat tightness, like choking

Burping urges

Constant checking: “Am I breathing?”

Fear of falling asleep: “What if I stop breathing in sleep?”



Despite all that, I still slept 6–7 hours some nights — which showed me my body still knew how to survive, even when I thought it didn’t.



🤯 I kept asking myself:


“Is this withdrawal? Or am I dying?”
“What if this symptom never goes away?”
“What if this isn’t anxiety?”





✅ Things that helped (slowly):


Reminding myself: ""If it were dangerous, I'd have passed out already""

Seeing posts on Reddit saying others had the exact same breathing obsession

My therapist explaining it's a nervous system glitch

Remembering: I had this same sensation even before (on a lower dose) — so this is just rebalancing

Positive inner dialogue like:

“I’ve slept through this.”
“My oxygen levels are fine.”
“This is withdrawal, not damage.”





Noticing small wins like: ""I got bored of obsessing today.""





💬 Something that really clicked for me:

Someone on Reddit told me:


“You’re not out of breath — you’re out of trust in your body.”



That hit hard. Because it’s true. My body has been working for me since I was born. It never needed micromanaging before. I just forgot to trust it.



🙌 Where I’m at now:


Still have breathing awareness sometimes

Cardiophobia comes and goes

But I’m functioning. Sleeping. Laughing again.

Trusting this will pass — because others have healed, and I’m seeing glimpses of that too.





💭 Final words to anyone reading this:

If you’re tapering off meds, or dealing with withdrawal or health anxiety, please know:


You are not alone.

Symptoms don’t equal danger.

Your brain is glitching — not broken.

You don’t need to fix everything — just stop feeding it.



Recovery doesn’t always feel like recovery. Sometimes, it feels like chaos. But the system is rebalancing.

You will get through this. So will I. 💙

1md1edv,I get overwhelmed by tiny decisions so I started building little systems to take the pressure off,"I’ve always been super anxious and indecisive. Even tiny choices like what food to order or how to respond in social situations can mess with my head. It’s not just the decision itself, it’s the spiral. What if I don't like what I will order? What if people judge me while I struggle to make a decision?

So lately I started creating small systems to handle those microdecisions for me. I basically offload the choice to something else so I dont have to overthink it in the moment. 

It helped way more than I expected. One of them even turned into a tiny tool I use whenever I eat out, just to avoid freezing up around food or drink menus.

Curious if anyone else does this and builds personal systems or decision shortcuts to calm their brain a bit?",1753865352.0,1,1,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md1edv/i_get_overwhelmed_by_tiny_decisions_so_i_started/,2025-07-30 08:49:12+00:00

1mcxok2,Left arm pain for over 2 years?,"Hey everyone, this has really been bothering me for a while and im not sure what to do anymore. When this first started happening, i went to the doctor to get it checked out. They did an EKG, heart monitor and blood test on me to see if anything was wrong, and everything came back fine and they told me i should probably get back on my Lexapro, which i did for a while.

Lexapro obviously helped but i remember i was still having pains in my left arm, i just wasnt anxious ab it lol. For a few months now ive been off my Lexapro because i cant stand it anymore, it makes me feel like a zombie and idc ab anything when im on it. But that was the last time i saw the doctor though, and still to this day my arm still hurts. I get all sorts of weird pains from it, pressure, stabbing pains, aching, pins and needles in finger tips and toes. I feel it everyday, its like my arm is just in constant discomfort all the time. Eventually i start getting anxious ab it throughout the day and i start experiencing other pains along with it like chest pain and discomfort, my jaw hurting, and sometimes a slight tingle feeling on my left side. 

I dont have health insurance anymore because the plan i was on had some sort of contract disagreement with pretty much every hospital near me. So i have to wait for enrollment again to get another insurance plan. I have had really bad health anxiety for the past 8 years of my life i would say, and i feel like i can never catch a break. Its getting to the point where its interfering with my daily life and i cant even function properly anymore bcus of it. 

Its like all this pain happens on the left side of my body, mainly my arm. I do have really bad GERD, it always hits hard at night at some point and makes me feel horrible. Its weird that when i get some sort of relief from my GERD my arm starts to hurt way less or be completely alleviated once my GERD calms down. Im also extremely EXTREMELY gassy. I am always burping and breaking wind CONSTANTLY. Its like i have infinite trapped gas or something. I also get relief from all these pains, even my arm, when i burp or break wind, which doesnt make any sense to me.

I also have tons of muscle spasms/twitches all over my body, mainly my left arm though. Something ive also noticed is that, all these problems basically get 10x worse after i eat literally anything. Not sure what to do right now since im not currently insured, but was wondering what u guys think and if anyone else has similar symptoms and experience with what im having.

1mcxmbh,It's back again,"So I had absolutely horrible anxiety for 2 years straight, ER visits in the double digits and thousands of dollars in medical debt later and one day I just pass out almost. Get to the ER and my troponin is elevated a good bit. But funny thing is, I wasn't scared at all. After my discharge life was fine for months, I was getting myself back until a few days ago. I got a nasty tooth infection in one of my lower wisdom teeth, I got Clindamycin for it and am 3 days into the antibiotic therapy. Before you ask I am seeing a dentist soon for an extraction. Problem is I now have chest pains which kinda feel like ""gas"" I don't know how to explain it. It's like gas but not at the same time. My heart is going pretty fast when I'm even 10 minutes late on my Metoprolol dose. For context before this infection I could go hours before needing my second dose of it. Thing is now that my nemesis (chest pain) is back, so is my cardiophobia. I am afraid that I'm gonna have a heart attack of all things because I'm afraid the infection has passed into my bloodstream and into my heart. I know that probably isn't the case and I know that the fast heart rate is probably just my body fighting off the infection or the herx reaction to the antibiotics killing off good gut bacteria but. I'm back to being afraid guys. I mean looking at the symptoms nothing is pointing towards a heart issue, no breathing problems with exercise as long as I have my Metoprolol in me, no pvcs that I can feel anymore. I'm probably gonna take a Xanax and try to chill out for awhile from all this. ",1753851119.0,2,2,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcxmbh/its_back_again/,2025-07-30 04:51:59+00:00
1md16se,Red Scar On Right Forehead Area After Waking Up?,"Male and Late 30's. About 5'8 and 155 pounds.

When I got out of bed 2 days ago, I looked in the mirror and I have what appears and feels like a red scar on my right forehead area. I think during when I was sleeping,, I was sleeping on that side of my face so maybe that's what caused it. However, it still looks like this now. I am not sure if I got bit by mosquito or spider that might have caused this?

The thing is I do have acne still and recently had a cystic acne pimple that popped on the left side of my forehead. Usually when that happens, there is lot of blood that comes out. That spot is still healing.

Does anyone have a clue what this scar is? I posted the picture of it in my reply to this. I do know that if I was to sleep on my face and wake up, I would get these temporary indentations on my skin. But those go away usually in a few hours at the most.

Now when I touch this scar so to speak, I do notice like a pimple on the bottom part of the scar. The thing is when I have pimples growing, it's usually a pimple or a few pimples or a big cyst. This literally feels and looks like a scar in the picture I posted. Note, the reason why my forehead on the left side looks a bit tan is because I currently have acne cream on it. But can someone tell me what is this red scar? If you look at the red scar so to speak, notice how there are like 2 small pimples next to it. But I don't think I ever had acne pimple or cyst that appears like this scar.

1md0u8e,Anxiety due to cardiophobia,"Hey everyone,
I’m 18 and going through a really rough patch with health anxiety, especially around my heart. I’ve had two normal ECGs and an echocardiogram, all of which came back fine. No doctor has raised any red flags. Still, my brain keeps screaming, ""What if they missed something?""

Some days I feel light chest pressure, occasional left arm or leg numbness, irregular breathing, or a weird skipping heartbeat — and it instantly triggers thoughts like “Is this a heart attack?”, “What if it's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?” or “What if stress has damaged my heart permanently?”

I used to go to the gym regularly and even played sports. If I had a serious heart issue, I probably wouldn’t have been able to do all that, right? But still, I can’t seem to convince myself I’m okay.

I’m also tapering off an anti-anxiety med (Placida), and I think that’s made my symptoms spike. I’ve had “manual breathing,” lightheadedness, chest awareness, and even weird sensations around my collarbone area. It's exhausting to constantly monitor my body and doubt every natural sensation.

I keep reading that health anxiety can mimic heart problems and that the fight-or-flight response can mess with breathing and heart rhythm, but my brain always goes “What if this time it’s different?”

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of obsessive fear around their heart even after being cleared? How did you learn to trust your body again?

Just want to feel normal again.

1md0197,What kind of therapy could help me ?,"Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for taking the time to read all of this! I need some advice regarding therapy because, to be honest, I’m starting to feel a bit hopeless.

To explain quickly: I suffer from severe anxiety, mostly related to how I see myself (I hate myself lol), and as a result, how others perceive me. I tend to ruminate a lot — constantly going over things in my head to the point that it makes me sick. Honestly, it’s ruining my life. I sabotage all my social relationships because of my constant worries, and I’m so tired of being stuck in these endless loops.

I’ve been seeing psychiatrists/therapists for six years. I’ve had a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) psychologist for the past three years whom I really like — talking to her has helped me a lot (especially with getting out of depression and dealing with s**cidal thoughts), but I still don’t feel like I’m really improving when it comes to my overall anxiety and getting out of these patterns.

The thing is, after all this time, I have a pretty good understanding of my mechanisms, the root causes, how my mind works, etc., but I need concrete help. I need to change this, and I feel like the therapy I’ve done so far hasn’t helped me resolve it. I know it’s not that simple, but honestly, I also know I’ll never get through this alone, and I need help.

So, what kind of therapy do you think could help in my case? Do you know of anything other than CBT that could help work on this?",1753859903.0,1,1,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1md0197/what_kind_of_therapy_could_help_me/,2025-07-30 07:18:23+00:00

1mcpnii,I have realized I’m worried about nothing.. :/,"
Hi.. sorry if this post is sorta long?.. my apologies in advance.. I’ve been dealing with POCD for a little bit, I’m a male and currently right now I’m 19yo but I turn 20 soon.. and I’ve already accepted the WORST that I ever could have been back then in my past was a pedophile who never sexually assaulted ANYONE.. even me simply typing and saying I could have been a pedophile back then makes feels really weird.. I seriously refuse to believe I was a pedophile even back then.. there is just no way.. right?!.. 

One thing that calms me down and makes me happy again is knowing I have never sexually assaulted anyone EVER.. I’ve been inside for the past 5 years and I didn’t like people who aren’t my family see me or even look at me.. and even now I still don’t like people who aren’t my family see me or even look at me.. 

The only person I interacted with who was younger than me was sometime in 2020 when I met this 12 or 13 year old boy?.. and I was 14 or 15.. we first met on a Minecraft server we both played on and the Minecraft server had a discord server for it.. I don’t know if we added each other on discord or what but I think we only called each other once?.. all I think I can remember saying back then is I was getting water?.. and he said he was going to unmute me?.. I honestly can’t remember.. there was also a 17 or 18 year old girl?.. and she also played on that same Minecraft server back then as well.. I think I had a crush on her as well when I was 14 or 15 years old back then.. 

The ONLY thing that was sort of sexual with me and her was she was bisexual in real life, so I made a clan on the Minecraft server named BI or whatever.. but that was like literally it.. but even now I REGRET ALL THAT..

We also talked on a discord call as well, and in total I’m not sure how many discord calls I had with any of them.. all I remember is we were talking to each other in a discord call..

But NOW for some STUPID reason my brain is like.. “oh, what if you said something sexual with or to them but you forgot that all now?..” or “oh what if you sexually assaulted a person, multiple people, a small underaged child and multiple small underaged children back then and you forgot that all now?..” so I’m like.. “WHY would I talk about ANYTHING sexual back then when I was 14 or 15 years old to a 12 or 13 year old?.. or to a 17 or 18 year old?.. that makes NO sense..
and how would I simply forget about me sexually assaulting ANYONE especially if it was a small underaged child?!.. like that is very serious stuff, I wouldn’t simply forget any of all that stuff if I did really do that!.. 
and I actually didn’t do any of all that!.. I’ve literally been inside for 5 years!.. I don’t like anyone seeing me or even looking at me if they aren’t my family!..” 

Its always my brain being like.. “what if this” or “what if that” what if you just shut up, stop and leave me alone.. I’m trying to get over all this and I’m worried over literally NOTHING.. I have never done of those things EVER and I KNOW I haven’t!..


Could any1 plz explain why my brain makes me worried about that stuff?.. it’s VERY annoying..

1mczsqu,Breathing abnormality due to health anxiety/general anxiety,"Has anyone else felt like they can't feel their breath or like they're breathing manually after tapering off meds?


Hey everyone,
I’m posting this because I feel like I’m going through something weird and honestly quite unsettling—and I wonder if anyone else has experienced this too.

I recently tapered off Placida (Flupentixol + Melitracen) after being on it for a little over a month. Ever since I reduced the dosage, I’ve been feeling something extremely bizarre with my breathing. It’s hard to explain, but here’s what’s happening:


I feel like my breathing is way too light, like it’s not even happening.

It’s as if I’m manually controlling each inhale and exhale.

My chest feels hollow, and I don’t feel air going into my lungs even though I am breathing.

At times, it feels like I’m going to choke or stop breathing if I don’t focus on it.

I also get occasional chest pressure or strange fluttering/vibration feelings that make me hyperaware of my heartbeat and breath.



What’s even more confusing is that:


Medically, I’m fine. My heart tests (ECG, echo) came back normal.

I can sleep (though not always easily), and I’m not gasping or suffocating.

The symptoms come and go, especially when I focus on my breath. When I’m distracted (like talking, humming, or busy), the breathing feels normal again.



My therapist says this is just a withdrawal/tapering-off effect, and that the nervous system is just adjusting and will recalibrate. I’m trying to stay calm, not poke the symptoms too much, and trust the process—but it’s honestly scary sometimes.

So I’m wondering:
Has anyone else been through this kind of “manual breathing / can’t feel my breath / hollow chest” phase either due to anxiety or med withdrawal?
If yes:


How long did it last?

Did it go away on its own?

What helped you cope or recover?



Even just knowing I’m not alone in this would mean a lot. Thank you ❤️",1753858991.0,1,24,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mczsqu/breathing_abnormality_due_to_health/,2025-07-30 07:03:11+00:00

Ik anxiety can manifest as spasm but I don't even know if this is spasm , I went to a surgeon he said it is because of long hours of sitting and nothing to worry about . Did an chest xray and everything came normal . 
Went to the ortho and he said that my back muscles are weak therefore it is happening.

1mcvg43,Anxiety about kidney infection or sepsis…,"
(I am not seeking a diagnosis or medical advice)

I’ve been having a uti for the last week now. I’ve only had one symptom and I waited about 3-4 days before finally going to urgent care and getting a urine test. For whatever reason they said they only saw slight white blood cells so it wasn’t a guaranteed positive but it was possible I was in the beginning stages of  a uti. The next day in the afternoon I got my antibiotics and took one pill but had TERRIBLE symptoms and promptly stopped them. Now I plan on calling urgent care to potentially switch to a different antibiotic. I’m so incredibly anxious because I’ve had this uti for about a week now and I’m so afraid of it turning into a bad kidney infection over night or developing sepsis. I live alone so I’m afraid if I got sepsis no one would be there to call the ambulance. I’m freaking out and the pressure is especially uncomfortable right now. I’m shaking from my anxiety and today I had some mild back pain which only made it worse. My anxiety is making my symptoms worse which sucks. I’ve been going into a spiral of TikTok’s and Reddit posts about people letting their uti go on for only a week or even a few days and getting a kidney infection. I need advice on how to calm myself or some reassuring words.

The tightness in my chest feels so uncomfortable and sleep is impossible. This happens every night. I’m now having a mini panic attack essentially every night as I try to go to sleep. I’m not sure how to overcome this. I take lexapro and it doesn’t really seem to be helping me anymore in the same way that it did a few years ago.

1mcyzuy,Weird chest feeling/scared about diseases from mice,"Ive been sorta stressed about many things, the main thing is i found out theres mice in my apartment but we cant afford pest control so its up to us to deal with it (how we will i literally dont know). I went through a box of stuff yesterday which had mouse poop in it and immediately washed my hands etc, today i went through a box with my mom and surprise to no one, more mouse poop. We sanitized everything, i washed my hands religiously whatever. I am so scared that im going to die because of these mice, the feeling in my chest is so weird and almost airy. Im only 19 so i know i shouldn’t be worried about heart attacks but that wont stop me from worrying about it. 

I dont know what to do, i know there’s nothing i can do now as its 2 am but tomorrow i need to start taking action, im just really scared that im going to get sick from this. We never had mice until our neighbours moved in (duplex apartment). My apartment is awful and we cant afford to move either right now though we are looking just in case.

My chest also felt like when i bent over it was filling with liquid? Or rather my skin was being pulled away? I cant explain it properly but it was unsettling and now it feels weird and aching, almost hollow aswell but its not as i can feel my heart. I dont know what to do. Im also agoraphobic so i cant go to the doctor or hospital which scares me. Im so tired of existing like this. Im also having bad stomach issues and im scared of dying. Life is so scary

1mcrxrr,It’s okay to feel it ... just don’t bottle it up!,"Ever notice how feeling nervous and feeling excited can seem exactly the same?

That’s because — to your body — they are the same.

Your heart races, your palms sweat, your breathing shifts… the only difference is how your brain interprets those sensations.

Simon Sinek once pointed out that high-performing athletes don’t say, “I’m nervous.”  
They say, “I’m excited.”  
Same physical response, different mindset.

So the next time anxiety shows up before a big moment, whether it’s public speaking, an interview, or even a social event, try telling yourself:  
“This is excitement.”  
You’re not lying. You’re redirecting.

That surge of energy is real. And it needs an outlet.  
You can either let it shut you down, or use it to fuel you forward.

And here’s something we all know:  
When you’re stressed and someone tells you to “calm down”, it rarely works.

In fact, your body might need up to an hour to fully return to baseline after a stress spike.  
So forcing calm too quickly? Usually backfires.

Instead, try this:  
Notice the anxiety. Name it. Let it move through you.  
Feel it without fear, and it’ll pass faster than if you panic about feeling anxious.

Another way? (my personal approach as a mom)  
Try a short meditation — just 5 quiet minutes to reconnect with your breath.  
Then jot down what you’re feeling.  
It doesn’t have to be full sentences — just words.  
One emotion. One thought. One trigger.  
Dump it in a planner. That space becomes your release valve.

It’s not about control.  
It’s about letting go, gently, one breath, one word at a time.",1753834257.0,3,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcrxrr/its_okay_to_feel_it_just_dont_bottle_it_up/,2025-07-30 00:10:57+00:00
1mcuqdl,All time low as my two kitties struggle from unrelated illnesses at the same time,"TW for pet health issues, so sorry.

Y'all, I am really struggling. We have two senior cats, who have been with us longer than we've been married, 15 years!! We took a quick trip out of state for a much needed vacation and nature appreciation trip (to touch grass, as the youths say) and on the day we were flying back, we got a call that one cat was being rushed to the vet with urinary issues (they stay with our trusted boarders because one baby needs twice daily meds for seizures and we'd hate for him to be alone if something happened). We came back and despite the vet visit, he was doing worse, so we took him back and he needed a procedure. Meanwhile, his sister basically crashes and we discover she has kidney disease. Lots of treatments and vet bills later, both babies are home and basically need 24/7 monitoring.

I am at my wits end. Work has no more patience for my pet emergencies, so I have guilt and anxiety about that. They're both just so lethargic and sickly right now, I am just sick with worry about both of them. I'm crying constantly and exhausted and impatient. Just a mess.

Anyone found a good way to cope with the anxiety that accompanies health issues in beloved pets?

I even get worried about my clothes in terms of if their wearable if I’m in danger, long skirts freak my out incase in case I get chased I won’t make it far, or getting it trapped in the train door. Big boots making me slow and I won’t be able to run if a bloody bomb drops. It all sounds stupid but this is what my mind things a lot. I hate lifts because I get claustrophobic and I don’t even like the London Underground cause I think it’s gonna get busy and I’ll suffocate and die. I hate public transport, buses freak me out I have to be near the door otherwise people pile on and I’m at the back, I need an exit everywhere I go and it’s ruining my life. My first day in college I was so sick because I wasn’t familiar with the exits, my class is across a bridge and down stairs. At night I think someone’s gonna stab me and climb in my window, or when I’m In the shower somethings gonna happens and I’ve got no clothes on so I try and be quick as possible. When I was younger I feared rain, yes RAIN. I thought it was gonna Drown me every time and it was a serious issue, I wouldn’t go out anywhere if it wasn’t sunny and my parents thought it was insane.

1mcyeys,Escitalopram's (Lexapro) effectiveness with chronic social anxiety?,"Hey everyone! I've been suffering with chronic social anxiety since I was about 14 years old (currently 19) and it has made me anxious and stressed out about the thought of any social situation with anyone ever since. I cannot talk to anyone without overthinking everything I'm saying, thinking about how they will react to each and every word I say, constantly wondering if people are enjoying my presence or not, if they like me or not, not knowing what to say and freezing up, and having to fake laugh and over-exert myself in order to mask and fit in, even though it always feels ingenuine and I get stressed out about how fake it all must seem to others. I can't even walk to school with my flat mates without getting stressed out about being too boring and my entire side of the conversation being too lackluster that they think slightly worse of me mentally after it has happened, so I've started avoiding talking to people and doing everything I possibly can in order to avoid having to interact with people so that a negative interaction cannot possibly happen in any shape or form. I perform for others, and then I get anxious about them hanging out with me again when I'm not as energized or feel as up for performing and putting on an engaging personality/act so I just downright avoid them all together so this cannot happen. It has chewed away at my ability to make friends and feel confident in anything I say or do, and I cannot usually enjoy hanging out with anyone except my partner. 

I described this (somewhat poorly) to a psychiatrist back in late 2023 and she prescribed me Escitalopram. I haven't taken it yet, even though its been 2 years, because I'm scared of experiencing emotional blunting and not being ""myself"" anymore. I feel strong emotions all of the time (strong positive ones and negative ones) and really enjoy feeling these because it makes me feel really human and alive. 

It would be awesome if anyone with experience on Escitalopram could tell me if it has helped with a similar experience of anxiety/social anxiety and what kind of side effects you have experienced?

1mcy55d,want to start dating but terrified that i'll be killed,"i want to start dating! 

i feel as though im ready for the emotional intimacy, know what i want in a partner, yada yada. 

but i've always had a fear of being killed once i get close to people, even in friendships. 

dating is a whole new territory and makes me twice as anxious!

i want to get over my fear, but im terrified that someone will be out to get me, stalk me, harm me, etc. 

i don't know how to rationalize this because i think that if i rationalize it, i'll get too comfortable and that's when ill be harmed. 

this likely stems from trauma, which makes me feel even more valid, even though i know it's probably unlikely? 

tons of people are alive and in happy relationships. 

a part of me wishes i was normal, but it feels like the anxiety is so deeply rooted, i don't know who i will be without it. what if i need it one day and it is gone? 

has anyone overcome this fear of people getting close to you? 
it's not the intimacy im afraid of, it's the possibility that i may literally be murdered.

1mctq0q,I'm terrified of the future,"I feel so powerless about everything, and it makes me so nervous. How do I deal with it? 

I'm currently a rising sophomore and AI becomes more of a looming threat to my career everyday. Talking to my parents doesn't help because they don't understand (my dad's career is set, he's soon to be done, and my mom doesn't work), and I don't feel comfortable talking to my peers about it because I'm sure they're feeling very similar to me. I want to have a comfortable life, nothing extravagant, but instead I'm scared that housing will be too expensive and that I'll be obsolete compared to computers. My hobbies can be replicated by computers, and soon I won't have a job either.

Along side that, politics makes me nervous. I know not everything is doom and gloom, but watching the way the US is going makes me feel terribly out of control. Watching what my government is doing and what other governments are doing makes me feel powerless. And I feel stupid worrying about it, because this isn't anything new. People have never really been in control of their government. Many wars have been fought against civilians wishes, what I am going through is nothing new, but I don't know how to deal with it. I hate keeping up with the news, but at the same time, I don't want to become uninformed just because I'm afraid. 

Additionally, I get nervous about the future of the world. I hate worrying about global warming, and it stresses me to see so many people not care or not do anything about it. Or finding out that certain issues are more affected by major companies that don't care. I feel powerless. 

I know none of these opinions are new or original, but I just don't know how to deal with them. I need tips",1753839318.0,2,3,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mctq0q/im_terrified_of_the_future/,2025-07-30 01:35:18+00:00
1mcxxbb,"Need help finding out whether or not I have anxiety. And if I did, would it be worth pursuing a diagnosis?","I am a 20F, wondering about whether or not I may have an anxiety disorder. Easy things like going to work tomorrow afternoon become emotional nightmares because of all the what-ifs or what-could-goes-wrong. I am so exhausted from it all that sometimes I cannot put the stress into words. I want to say something important, but it feels like a big rock is on my chest, and I'm so afraid of the other person's response that I can't move my mouth. Sleeping can be a hard experience for me, too. If I did not have my meds, I would be twirling my hair and clenching my jaw in my sleep. I use skin picking as a way to soothe myself. These feelings of anxiety lead to a negative cycle where I put something off because I am too stressed to do it today. Then I forget about it or keep putting it off until more stress comes up from it. I just don't know what to do anymore, I guess. This feels like it will continue to impact my life, and I just don't see a way out. Does anyone have any advice?

It's 2 am and im on a cruise ship. i had to poop so bad and i'm really poop shy so once everyone's asleep i finally had the chance to go. 

I flushed and the toilet literally clogged so hard. like the hole where the stuff goes down is so tiny so of course it wouldn’t go down. it started gurgling and my sisters asleep so i kept flushing and praying and it made it worse 

it’s not rising now or anything but I don’t want to call maintenance and wake her up so early so i’m leaving it be but i’m worried it’s going to randomly flood or gurgle again. 

I texted my mom (she’s in another cabin) but she’s asleep and i don’t want to knock on the door and freak her out. My sister has very little tolerance for me and when she wakes up and sees what i did she’s going to be so angry 

I just can’t shut my mind off about it now and I can’t sleep, even though we have such an early day tommorow. every noise and creak i hear makes me  run over to the bathroom to make sure nothings overflowing, and i can’t stop kicking myself for doing this

1mcn2yb,How do Anxious people Deal with Divorce or Break Up of Long Relationship?,"Hi everyone. I am 35 and my wife is 37. I am contemplating a divorce. My wife and I have been married for almost 10 years and together for 11. We have two children. Financially we are very secure. I make good money and she stays at home. I also have what I have been told is GAD. I would say I cope with this fine. I work hard, spend lots of time with my kids. I have supportive parents but they don't live in town. I also have a supportive sister who lives across the country. Not many friends to be frank. We live in the USA. 

My question is, does anyone here have experience with a divorce or break up of a long relationship? How did it affect your anxiety? I tend to hyper focus when I am in the middle of a difficult situation. So maybe the divorce process will be okay. I am also interested in how life after divorce went.

1mcp0cs,"Help, my wife has bad anxiety and it’s affecting our marriage","My wife has been a very anxious person since we got married, it’s either health anxiety and she’s obsessing over every symptom she gets or she gets overly anxious and insecure in our marriage. Right now this is something we haven’t dealt with in the past but I have a son, he’s 11, i haven’t seen him since he was three years old or had any contact with him or his mom what so ever, we also live 975 miles away from him. Well, recently, about two months ago, my ex wife contacted me via Facebook for the first time in 7 years saying that my son is asking questions, and she sent me some photos of him and told me about some of his accomplishments over the last couple years. And she even told me the next time we visit their home state (my family still lives there too so I visit every once in a while) she said she’d be willing to meet me with him if he’s okay with it. I figured my wife would be happy for me and supportive of this but instead it went complete 180. Her anxiety spiked through the roof and she’s been having panic attacks and nightmares about my ex wife speaking to me and it’s triggered her insecurity by 1000%
I’ve talked with her calmly re assuring her I have NO feelings anymore towards my ex wife and that our conversations have been strictly about the boy and that’s it, I forgot to add we do have a daughter as well. Her other panic is that if I talk to my son or see him next time we go visit his home state I’m going to forget all about our daughter and that I’m going to love him more, how can I possibly get her to calm the hell down and stop letting all of this rule her life? The anxiety and stress for her about all of this has been causing her hormones to go whack and her menstrual cycles have even been messing up because of it.
One more thing I will add, me and my wife split up a few years ago for about 4 months due to me cheating, not like I love admitting that but it’s true, but she took me back and I found god and I’m a changed man now but she’s still holding onto the past and that’s where her insecurity is coming from about me and ex wife talking",1753826643.0,3,4,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcp0cs/help_my_wife_has_bad_anxiety_and_its_affecting/,2025-07-29 22:04:03+00:00

Now I have the knowledge of all the rare diseases and have seen them for myself in a lot of my patients. Ignorance is indeed bliss.. my current fixation is right side/rib/upper right back pain.

1mcum3a,TIL; Anxiety can cause fever indirectly,"Not too long ago, I entered a period of huge stress in my life. I won't go into the details but basically, I was throwing up all the time and panicking because I thought I was gonna mess something up. 

Around 2 weeks into that, I got really weird symptoms like fever, body aches, and tiredness. Went to the doctor for a blood test.

Everything was fine. But, the doctor noticed my EBV levels were super elevated. As it turns out, I had mono at some point in my life and these levels are associated with the viral count in my blood. 

Mono can reactivate for any reason, but especially during times of great stress because the immune system is weakened or compromised. 

Make sure to take care of yourself and seek medical care if you feel like this happens to you too.

1mcpm0y,"What’s wrong with me? Always wired, tense, and overstimulated","I’m 23 and have felt constantly tense for as long as I can remember — like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight. Shallow breathing, mentally drained after work, and overstimulated in group settings. One-on-one I’m fine, and I don’t feel out of place — I socialize easily with friends, coworkers, play golf, etc. But new people or big groups make me nervous.

I sleep 7–8 hours, walk 8–10k steps, just started the gym, and work a normal 9–5. I’m not isolated and my routine seems solid, but I still come home feeling anxious, disconnected, and totally overstimulated — while everyone else doing the same seems fine.

I also get super fixated on things — hobbies, goals — then lose interest weeks later. It’s a repeating cycle.

Tried magnesium, B vitamins, C, and L-theanine — no real help. My brother feels the same, so maybe it’s genetic?

1mcu883,I hate this.,"I 35F have always been fairly anxious but lately its bad. In December 2024 I started on GLP-1, and in May I really started to take supplements like vitamin d3 k2, myo inositol, and fish oil. Also my GLP-1 was compounded with B12. I switched from semaglutide to trizepatide end of May and thats when my anxious started. I told the doc that my heart was racing, intrusive thoughts, chest pain. They said it sounded like anxiety and try going for a walk and take my protein 🙃 then 2 weeks later I took my shot and I had the worst panic attack I've ever had in my life. I almost woke up my husband st 3 am to take me to the hospital. I threw away the GLP-1 in the morning. I also started therapy once a week.
Fast forward to now, its been 3 almost 4 weeks since my last shot and I thought things were fine. But on Friday night another panic attack. Not as bad, but still. And then another on Sunday night. Also not as bad, but still. It feels like its lingering... so i cut out coffee, and all of my supplements. I had blood work done on Monday and tomorrow I have a follow up to go over it. From what I saw everything looked normal except my b12 is super elevated. That could be from my compounded b12 GLP1 but its been almost 4 weeks so I thought that'd go down... also my doc prescribed me hydroxyzine. I took that last night with l-theanine and magnesium glycinate. Finally slept but man was it hard to wake uo. Anyways I also have an appt on Monday with a psychiatrist. And I'm nervous about starting something like an SSRI since I'm hyper-reactive to things. 

Idk if I'm looking for advice or venting.. but i worked out this afternoon to release happy chemicals in my brain but i feel anxious again. I just dont know why this feeling is lingering when I was fine last week 👎 ots scary.",1753840747.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcu883/i_hate_this/,2025-07-30 01:59:07+00:00

1mcp4of,I have had terrible anxiety and depression since I went out with my crush who is married,"Hi, i (25M) have had really bad anxiety and depression since going out with my crush who is much older and married.

First, I want to tell you all a bit about myself. I can't remember since when I started having anxiety because I think I had it my whole life. I am and was always very introverted and don't trust a lot of people. I am also not very social so I tend to feel lonely a lot of the time. I have had a diagnosis of chronic depression and anxiety since 2018 and have been on medical treatment since then. I am also seeing a therapist since 2020 and have most probably also have ocd although it was never officially diagnosed.

Now to the present time: I have a crush on an older married co-worker (45F). It is my first job since I finished school and I am quite satisfied with the job I have. I met her before I started to work there as this company usually invites their new workers to their annual Christmas dinner so I had the chance of talking to her before starting to work. I nearly instantly started to have feelings for her. I didn't know anyone at the Christmas dinner and she was the first person to invite me to sit with her and my future colleagues and to talk to them. Since then she has been the person i talk to the most at work and we have become quite close friends. We usually take lunch breaks at the same time and also help each other out with our respective work. She has helped me in every way she can and I will be forever grateful for that as i am quite introverted so I tend to not ask for help even when I need it. We started talking to each other as well outside of work and would sometimes text one another to talk about work and how we both feel because we have some strong personalities working with us.

Our company often does some after work events where colleagues can meet up and have a drink and we both went to one, two weeks ago. We had already talked about going and she said that she would be going because I would be going as well. So that day arrives and we both go and have a really nice time together. We talk to each other and make jokes and are having a very good time. One time she lightly hits me on my arm as I was joking and said in a jokingly way that she wants a divorce from me as she isnt happy with that joke. I play along and we both stop talking for a minute. After a little while she starts talking to me again and asks if I want to cancel the divorce and get together again. I agree and we continue having a great time together. After the after work some colleagues wanted to keep socializing and planned on going to a bar together. I asked her if she wanted to as well and she proposed that we should get a drink alone and then rejoin them. I agreed and we had a drink and had some very deep talks. I was starting to imagine a possible life with her that evening and that was when everything went sour. Her husband was walking along the street and saw us. He joined us and she introduced me to him. We both quickly nodded to each other and then he leaned towards her and they had a quick kiss. When I saw that, reality hit me very hard. I started sweating and not being able to hide my emotions very well. As I saw that I wasn't feeling better as time went by, I said to her that I should get going as It was already one o'clock and paid for the drinks. I said goodbye to her and left. As I was walking towards my car, I fell apart. I started crying and realizing that all that hope and all those feelings I had for her weren't mutual but were always only on my part. 

I arrived home and couldn't sleep. My thoughts were only about her and how miserable I felt. I didn't know how I would be able to talk to her again and not break down. The next day, I went to work and we barely talked. She tried to talk to me and joked around but I couldn't. I was nearly tearing up and was always very anxious. I nearly had a panic attack during work and barely managed to get through the day. The next day, I had a meeting with my psychiatrist and he gave me a sick leave until after my holidays which will be until the end of August. Since then I have felt miserable. I am anxious about how I will be able to go back to work. I have been depressed as she was basically the only person I had contact to outside my family and I feel guilty because even though I didn't do anything wrong and didn't tell her about my feelings, I feel like we won't have that same connection now as we used to. She didn't do anything wrong and was always there for me and I probably misread her intentions and now am paying for it. Since then, I haven't been motivated, I don't want to do anything and have been a mess really. I don't know how I will come out of this pit and don't know how I Will be able to not have these feelings for her. I don't believe I have a chance of meeting someone outside of work as I am very introverted and am not really interesting to be honest and just don't see a reason to exist. I don't want to stop existing but I just don't see a path.

I have never been in a relationship and have never been that close to someone and it just hurts as I am stuck at the same place again as I have been for these past years. I am angry at myself for reading her wrong and honestly don't know how I can face her again. She has been very supportive since I have had my sick leave and has messaged me a couple of times saying that she misses me at work and I really appreciate her but those messages just give me a false hope of something that will never happen. I don't even really know why I fell so hard for her as I cant really see myself spending my whole life with her because of the age difference but this just sucks. My psychiatrist increased the dosage of my meds for this time but I haven't noticed any changes. I just feel awful and I am conflicted with myself for allowing this to happen. She wants to meet up during the holidays and I don't know what to do. 

I am thinking returning to work on thursday to finish some work before going on holiday but i fear that i might have a panic attack or that i might break down. I don't want my coworkers to see me as weak…

1mctf4g,I feel scared about my friendships  so i willingly self isolate to prevent myself from feeling bad,"spoiler — i just feel worse when i do this. 

For context , i’m someone who has really bad anxiety when it comes to my friendships , relationships , anything like that. because i have such a horrible fear of being alone for good. Im terrified of them leaving me , i’m terrified of them finding someone better than me that i’m useless to them bc, i’m scared i’m not as interesting so they lose interest in me.

 i’ve grew up somewhat being ignored , pushed away by others & disregarded. By family mainly (not my mom or dad) and at some point my friends. I’ve lost almost all of my friends , mainly just being ghosted or they move away. this includes the ppl i called really close friends. now i know that it’s sumn that’s gonna happen but after it all contact is gone. ive done so so so much & what i could for people to not just leave .. nothing works and i think part of me has become drained by it. 

now , also bc of the way i grew up around family , ive started to latch on to ppl and do what i could for more attention and to feel like i am loved by ppl.  I’ve grown such bad attatchment issues with ppl who did the slightest for me , and it’s so unhealthy bc then it leads me to feeling so so bad , i get the worst anxiety and i become so obsessive that it starts to take a toll on me. And from experiences , those same ppl who show love to me , do things with me , all the time always end up leaving me .


I feel threatened by love and kindness from them , i’ve always thought they are doing this just so i become more and more attached and once it gets to a point they will leave . So , when i feel like im getting too close to someone , or my feelings for them become too much or i feel too scared , i isolate for a few days to a few months. But yk what ? never helped , not. once . i convince myself that everything my friends tell me is something meaningless and that they don’t mean anything they tell me. i can’t even believe when someone tells me they “love” me bc it just doesn’t feel like they mean it. but ,,

I’ve had panic attacks at times because , while i always think isolation will help with my feelings , i still crave to feel loved and actually feel like those around me care and won’t ignore me & i don’t have to ask for love or go different lengths too… i’ve felt like everyone was leaving me , everyone i knew just gone and it would feel like my heart is just getting broken and it hurts so bad. 

I just want to believe that i am loved , cared for , i done want it to feel like i have to isolate myself all the time. i’m convinced they are getting tired of it even though they say they aren’t. Idk how to deal with any of my feelings , i feel so strongly abt all my friendships but i feel so threatened all the time and sometimes i get so obsessive with one person that they just don’t leave my thoughts and im scared of my own thoughts i just feel so weird.. i just want it all to just go away. I’ve lost one of my best friends just by being like this . i try to express my feelings to friends but some just seem like they don’t care or or idk ,,, i just don’t know ",1753838439.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mctf4g/i_feel_scared_about_my_friendships_so_i_willingly/,2025-07-30 01:20:39+00:00

1mctb4n,Medication fear,"Hi all. Ive had 8 months of severe anxiety. I have been in and out of hospital, totally unable to function. I have a husband who works away for a month at a time and 3 kids so I just need to get better before my life completely falls apart.

I was on prozac when this anxiety started, switched to lexapro and got worse, switched to zoloft and got worse again. Turns out I dont metabolise lexapro or zoloft, tiny doses sent me off the rails completely.

I trialled paroxetine for 2 weeks but the nausea was horrible and I psyched myself out of taking it because of the terrible withdrawals if I had to come off and because the side effects sound really bad. However it seemed to be helping my anxiety a little or at least not making it worse while I was on it so I'm thinking of trying it again.

Part of me is still afraid of it because it sounds like poison, im scared of the nausea not stopping, im scared of being a zombie and being exhausted all the time, and I'm scared if I ever have to come off it. but the other part of me just can't live like this anymore and I'm running out of options.

1mcg0s4,I got a call from an unrecognized phone number and it's been plaguing me for 24 hours.,"So last night I was with friends when I got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize. That sent me straight into two panic attacks. In the panic attack I deleted every trace from the phone number, so I can't call back and haven't received a call since.

I have a severe anxiety disorder and this Monday I have a meeting with a psychiatrist to get me started on medication for it. Reason for it is, that for the last four weeks, I was too afraid to sleep at home, because of a mouse. So I slept at my girlfriend's place for four weeks. 

Now I'm scared that the phone call was my landlord or a neighbor asking me why I haven't slept at home. Rationally I know that's not the case and even if it was, I'm not doing anything wrong.

Still, it's terrifying me and I've been feeling severe anxiety all day. I can't seem to make it go away. Got any tips on what to do?",1753806344.0,4,5,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcg0s4/i_got_a_call_from_an_unrecognized_phone_number/,2025-07-29 16:25:44+00:00

1mcr8hs,Panic Attacks & Buspar,"Starting around the end of May I started experiencing more frequent anxiety/panic attacks with episodes of vomiting. I just turned 44 and figured it was associated with perimenopause, and reached out to my PCP about it. She told me to see gyn. 

Between June and July I had three more episodes of panic attacks with nausea/vomiting leading me to the ER on 3 occasions, where I had scans and imaging done. On my third visit I demanded to be admitted because I had barely eaten in 3 weeks and was so weak, I felt like I was dying. The only thing that seemed to be helping was Zofran and Ativan. 

I spent 5 days in the hospital and after my endoscopy showed mild gastritis - they got me stable and discharged me home. The Ativan seemed to be helping and I was able to eat a little bit.

I followed up with my PCP yesterday since I've always had mild general anxiety, and have had a few panic attacks when I was younger...I was thinking maybe I need something long term. I had tried Celexa and Prozac in my 20's and I did not do well with either of them. 

He suggested I start Buspar 5 mg three times a day, and use the Ativan as needed until the Buspar starts to work. I skipped the Ativan today and just started the Buspar on its own because I have such anxiety about medications to begin with...and by 3 pm I was having a panic attack. Plus the Buspar is making me slightly nauseous even with food, and giving me hot flashes. I know this takes time to adjust to - but I'm just so tired of being nauseous. How long before it eventually evens out? I just hate this feeling and I have OCD about medical things - I can't just relax because of the way I feel which is making it worse.

I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement that this is normal and I'll start feeling like myself again. Thank god for my husband taking care of me and helping over the past month, because I don't think I could have done this without him. I don't wish this on anyone.

1mcqtz0,Disturbing dreams,"When I was a kid, about 5-7 years old (I don't remember exactly), I had a recurring dream: a huge humanoid anthropomorphic spider is watching from behind, slowly creeps up and eats a sheep or goat. Most of the dream it just watches it, the sheep doesn't react to anything the whole dream, like it's just a body. What could this be? How can this be interpreted?
I see this dream as an analogy to violence, possibly sexual violence. But it's never happened in my life, and I don't think the mind can generate shit like that for no reason.
I rarely have dreams. They are always absurd, the plot usually involves violence.

I know it can and I won’t be pushing it. 

But as I get older i think of every scenario of danger anytime. Even at home. I can not do crowds. Barely can do shopping. Any place that I can’t immediately leave from feels so scary. I walk into a store and immediately think okay what would happen if someone started shooting. Everyone would run. What if they ran over me. What if we all piled up at the doors and couldn’t get out in time. 

Today we went to a new store near us. Specifically went at night on a Monday to avoid crowds. And I felt like every person we passed was staring us down. Felt like a threat. Like I didn’t want to turn my back on them.

1mcoqiq,Trying to get under control,"I believe I have had a low level of anxiety and morning depression for years., but have been able to cope with it okay. I believe I also have codependency issues.

In the last 4 days, I've been really losing it. Crying at everything. Feeling like I need to gag every few hours, can't eat, tense and nervous, stomach ache, you name it. 

I'm achingly lonely any time I am not with others and am wearing out the patience of my close friends, uncomfortable dumping too much of this on my boyfriend, and certainly don't want to lay this on my adlut child who is in the process of moving out, which was the original trigger for this for me. (lots of concerns around this which I won't go into)  I am in therapy but her solution is that I should go on medication, and I've seen how it has been physically awful for my kid firsthand and, how its really impossible to do without it once started, so really don't want to do it (we have similar reactions to common stuff like OTC meds as well as antibiotics.) If you have some not-bad experiences with meds, please share. 

I think the trigger of this intense spiral a few days ago was my boyfriend  (with whom I'm planning to live after I'm on my own) saying he's concerned that I won't like being with him (he's protecting himself, making sure I'm sure, and I understand because I'm much more organized not to mention still working, and he is not, but I think I will be okay with this. It's definitely the least of my concerns right now.) We have been seeing each other for 12 years and travel together just fine. That conversation ended with hugs, and plans for moving HIS offspring out of his house, etc. But since then, I've felt like I am crawling out of my own skin. 

Physical activity, particuarly the physical shaking stuff off that one person on this site mentioned, helps some.  But what used to be a difficult start to the day is now an oppression that lasts at least until late afternoon but last two nights until almost 9 pm. Today, it just ended, and I'm able to write this post, but now I'm worried it will come back. My work output has dropped badly.

Sorry for the long lead in, but I am hoping that maybe someone can relate or offer advice. 

My actual question is --how do you keep from feeling like you can't take it anymore? How do you stop spiraling? Does anyone else feel so utterly lonely they just want to crawl in a hole (with others though, because = lonely). I have always been able to compartmentalize and just go on with my life and this all now feels like the absolute end of the world.

But sometimes I'm not too worried by my self image, and sometimes I am. I often catch myself fixating on the thighs I have, thinking a gap will appear if I don't eat as much or nothing at all.

1mcoj53,Plane Anxiety Help,"Hey guys! So as a fellow anxious person, my biggest fear (besides needles) is flying. And the past 2 years of my life have been filled with nothing but planes (good old long distance relationship). But i wanted to come on here and share some tips that helped me get less terrified of flying. 

1. Being not too early, but not too late to the airport. 
I’ve noticed the earlier i am at the airport the longer i think about flying and it freaks me out fast! But being too late makes me freak out about TSA lines. What i do is google the TSA lines for your airport and calculate exactly how much time you need to give yourself. I typically get to the airport 1.5 hours early if security is around a 10/20 minute wait and it leaves be about 40 mins until my plane boards. And it has helped me so so so much!!! 

2. getting a drink and snacks 
let’s be honest, plane food is okay but after a whole day of stressing out about flying food is the last thing on my mind so i end up starving by the time im on the plane.  I always get a couple snacks and a drink from starbucks or a cafe that i can bring on the plane with me (avoid caffeine if you’re sensitive i learned that the hard way) That way i can avoid the crappy airplane snacks and have a comfort snack. 

3. TELL THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS YOURE AN ANXIOUS FLYER 
I can’t Tell you HOW MUCH this has helped me!! Like seriously. I always walk on the plane and just say “hey my name is ___ and i’m a really anxious flyer, if you guys aren’t too busy do you think you could come check on me sometime during the flight” and even if they don’t, it still just gives me a piece of mind. And most of the time they explain that flying is super safe and to just relax! Which really helps hearing from someone who flys alllll the time.  

4. Chat up the person next to you 
I mean this is completely optional but i always ask the person next to me if they fly a lot and just have a convo with them during take off, sometimes they don’t wanna talk though and that’s okay too. I’ve just found that speaking to someone makes me feel less alone when i fly and calms my nerves a bit.

5. Familiarize yourself with the sounds of a plane
Go on tiktok and search up plane sounds and what they mean, because trust me it’s helped so much!! 
The random dings and weird grinding sounds of the plane are all supposed to happen and are super normal. It really calmed me down after knowing what they mean. 

6. if you can, tell the front gate before getting on the plane that you’re anxious and if you could board early. 
This has saved me the stress of slowing people down on the plane and just gives me a few extra minutes to calm down before everyone is getting on! it’s obviously hit or miss depending on who you ask but i’ve noticed most gate attendants don’t mind. 

7. ask a flight attendant if you can switch seats! 
sometimes there’s an empty row, or the emergency exit isn’t always full and they’re more than happy to move you around. I always ask after takeoff and trust me the extra leg room and space calms me down so much. Sometimes being cramped beside other people makes my anxiety so much worse. Just be super nice about it and explain to your flight attendant that you’re just a big anxious and would like some more space if there is any. They’re always really understanding.

And know that flying is super safe! and always remember it’s better to ask and be told no, than being miserable wishing you did ask. Safe flying! ",1753825468.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcoj53/plane_anxiety_help/,2025-07-29 21:44:28+00:00
1mceuof,Propranolol and nausea,"I’ve recently been prescribed propranolol by my GP since my anxiety is coming back in floods. For reference, i start a new job in September (my first full time career job). 

I was prescribed SSRI’s in the past (sertraline), which helped with the mental anxiety but the physical symptoms prevailed. My main symptom which feels like 90-95% of what my anxiety consists of is sickness and nausea. I will physically vomit often if my anxiety is bad which in turn makes me more anxious once i start feeling sick. 

My question is; I am aware propranolol helps with symptoms such as sweating, increased heart rate etc, but I don’t really suffer with them.

1mcnned,Still feeling down after an anxiety attack earlier in the day/late last night.,"It was my birthday yesterday and overall, the day was quite good. Had some nice food, went to the cinema, had a good social time with everyone irl. Then as they left and went to bed, I was getting depressed. So I checked my online spaces and saw hardly anyone said anything. So I sent people some birthday gifs, which might have been me begging for attention, but I just wanted my friends to wish me a happy birthday. One did, and then I mentioned to them I wished some other people online did. They questioned why I would do that, and I mentioned feeling down and such. They said it was weird to mention wanting specific people to wish me a happy birthday, and that it's attention seeking and doesn't look awesome. They also said they're an asshole when it comes to stuff like this. I panicked, they sort of talked with me about it but no in a really helpful way, saying to not throw my the celebration I had prior under the rug. Which isn't what I was doing. They ended it with saying I'm not wrong, and it wasn't some huge screw up.

1mchgzd,Looking for someone that can relate to intense health anxiety.,"Here’s my story…. TRIGGER WARNING FOR ANYONE WHO HAS HEALTH ANXIETY!

All started about 15 years ago when I found a lump in my testicle which turned out to be absolutely nothing but I was obsessed by it. 

I would check it 40/50 times per day, but couldn’t find the courage to tell anyone or go to a doctor. 

I’d literally ‘PRAY’ at my bedside that it wasn’t something serious. This whole episode lasted about a year and I would google, doom scroll, read Reddit stories of worst case scenarios and just generally spiral. I accepted my fate and let it lie in the hands of the health anxiety gods. (Thankfully it was all good) 

Fast forward to now, I’ve had every single health anxiety scare. You name a body part or a medical condition I have whole heartedly convinced myself that I’ve had it. 

It’s an absolutely destroyed me as a person. A once super active, career focussed family man has been reduced to someone who is legitimately afraid to leave the house. 

Any slight sensation that deviates even 1% from my baseline will trigger a panic attack. I convince myself I am going to die constantly. Where I’m in this constant fight or flight mode it feels like I’m walking on a boat constantly, my temperature regulation is dreadful and I am just living my life on the cusp of a panic attack. 

Earlier in the year I managed to have almost no anxiety for 6 months because I took up running. It was a true escape for me, I called it meditation in motion. Before I knew it I was running 4/5 times a week, getting quicker and fitter and then I had a panic attack mid run. An ambulance ride and an A&E visit later and I still haven’t been able to pluck up the courage to go for another run, because I’ve convinced myself it’ll trigger some kind of reaction in my body and I’ll end up back in A&E. 

To put it short, I’m struggling, I know I’d probably see some improvements if I exercised, but this seems to make me about as anxious as if I was dropped inside a lion enclosure at a zoo, so working in that behind the scenes 🤣 

I am riddled with fight or flight based physical symptoms and I know absolutely no one with health anxiety so feel like I’ve got no one to talk to. 

I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.

1mcn9wp,My partner shuts down whenever he's stressed/overwhelmed,"My (32f) partner (32m) and I are expecting our first. I'm six months pregnant and at 4 months we found out we were being evicted. We got the keys to our new place at the beginning of July and our friends graciously moved 95% of our belongings into our new place while we were out of town.

We're back home and our new place is much smaller than our old place. Everything is also just packed at random so it's an absolute chaotic disaster. My boyfriend also has done most of the moving because I can't lift heavy things (I tried and ended up with contractions as a result).

I've been suffering prenatal depression as well and he's been having to support me emotionally. it's been a lot for him and he has never once complained or made me feel bad about not carrying my weight 

Well now it's crunch time and we have to finish emptying our house and get cleaners in and repair holes for our final inspection. He's gone completely nonverbal and is kind of shutting down. We're trying to move the rest of our kitchen stuff and unpack then go back to our old place and move more. He keeps freezing and not knowing where to put stuff. I told him to take a break and I'll unpack. It's been three hours and he hasn't been able to help very much without getting overwhelmed. He also mostly just stares in the distance.

When he does help, it's not very helpful (he took all my books out of bins and put them in our storage room on the plastic shelves... We don't have space to waste on this and the books were better when they were at least contained). 

I'm also finding it hard to remain optimistic and hopeful while he's completely shut down and not saying anything. I spend most days feeling hopeless and like none of this is worthwhile or matters and that life is meaningless (we've addressed this at my last two prenatals, I'm in therapy and on some meds). I've been leaning on him so heavily as we have no family in town and it's been really heavy for him. I can't keep piling everything I can't carry (emotionally and physically) onto him and now I feel like I'm all alone in my despair.

We're both struggling mentally, I don't want to make it all about me. I've tried giving him space, I've tried getting him to take breaks. I've done a lot of the stuff today, including heavy lifting which is stressing me out. I've tried to reassure him and tried to be solution oriented (contacted a storage unit for example to help make space in our place). I've also told him I'm concerned he's depressed and we talked briefly about stress and anxiety, though most of his contribution to conversations is silence or just saying ""I don't know"".

1mcn25r,"I want to quit my job because it makes my anxiety worse, but at the same time i don't want to let them down","(this is a burner account not my main)

Ok so context: i’m 15, this is my first job ever, and it’s as a kids animator in beaches an hotels (i live in a coastal town in italy).

I have my stabil hotel, and i do 3h at it everyday except for sunday. On Wednesday i do 7 hours, because i also work in a beach, and it’s exhausting. I hate it so much.

Working in the hotel isn’t that bad, but honestly, it’s ruining my summer.

I literally never asked for a day off.

During all of june, i worked every day since the ending of school.

In july, i had a two-days long break, because i traveled to go to a concert. Literally the FIRST TIME i asked for a permit.

A week ago i had a friend’s very important birthday, it wasn’t even in the town i live in, but in a countryside home.

I asked for ONE shift off.

(I work lunch and dinner, and told the i wouldn’t be available for dinner)

My boss (not even 5 yrs older than me) started throwing a TANTRUM when i asked her one shift off.

It was a vocal message so i can’t translate it here.

This week i have an important family dinner, with family members coming from other cities, and i told them with four days in advance that i needed the dinner off.

It wasn’t on the table to skip the dinner, my parents really want me to go.

Il translate here the chat.

(in the chat the contact from the agency is a girl, a few years older than me)



Me: Hi sorry I have a family dinner on the 31st evening and I can't go to \*hotel name\*, I need someone to replace me, thanks



Them (a day later): a dinner is not a valid excuse to not go to work



Me: its a family event and my parents want me to go



Them: okay but i remind you this is a job

And I don’t think your parents skip work to go to dinners



Me: i know but i have family members coming from other cities, I can’t miss it.



Them: okay but but it doesn’t seem fair \*my name\*

Its not alright at all

I don’t want it to happen again

Because next time I won’t find anyone



I didnt reply to the last text because it was just plain childish.

Today i went to get stuff i needed from the agency, and they told me the same things again but in person.

During rhe texting, i was nervous, but when they talked to me i was almost shaking.

In the past two days, i had at least five panic attacks (only counting really serious ones) and i cried a lot more times.

I have anxiety and i really can’t keep this going.

I just want to quit and never see these people again, they’re making my life miserable.

But at the same time I only have less than a month left. It would be stupid.

1mcfksv,Struggling at Work — Feeling Isolated and Anxious,"Hey everyone,
I just needed to get this off my chest because it’s been weighing on me lately. I’m not a very talkative person by nature — I tend to only speak when spoken to unless I’m really comfortable with someone. I work as a cleaner in a hospital, and a few months ago, I was moved to a new area.

Since then, it’s been rough. The nurses and staff in this new area are really caddy — I often overhear them talking about other staff members behind their backs, and it makes me nervous about what they might be saying about me. When I walk into work, no one even acknowledges me. Not even a “hi.” It feels so awkward, and it’s pushing my social anxiety through the roof. Some mornings, I don’t even want to go in.

To make things worse, there’s one nurse in particular who always seems to have a problem with me. She’s called me out for not doing rooms — even though those rooms hadn’t even come to my pager yet — and she’s done it in front of other staff in a way that felt humiliating. I try to do a good job, but now I feel like everyone sees me as either crazy, stupid, or both. I’m so uncomfortable at work, and I don’t know how to fix this. I’ve been trying to keep my head down and just do my job, but it’s getting harder every day.

1mcfk5u,20+ Years with anxiety - Here's What Worked for Me & it WILL Help You Too,"Hi everyone,

I'm sharing this to potentially help someone out there **plus** learn from your experiences as well. This will be a bit long but I promise that it will help you.

**Background**

I'm 31(M) and have had anxiety since I was kid. Probably started around 7-8 years old.

I have a combination of anxiety/OCD (or maybe just anxiety?). When I was younger, my OCD manifested in the form of cleanliness/washing my hands. Then I overcame that solo. Then it manifested in the form of intrusive thoughts. Overcame that with self-practicing over years. I sought the help of medical practitioners who were **absolute garbage. One of which prescribed clomipramine and, not exaggeration, it destroyed my health.** In hindsight, a good medical practitioner would've been super helpful.

**Causes & Observations**

**1)** I have a severely deviated septum. This affects my breathing and always has. I **know for a fact** that this exacerbates my anxiety. Because when I use a nasal decongestant and can breathe better, my anxiety is definitely less. I also looked at the research and there's definitely a connection between intake of oxygen and breathing and anxiety.

**2)** I have had clinically low testosterone since I was about 19. Suffered for years and got official diagnosis from doctors who would still not treat me because I was ""too young"" although I was extremely symptomatic.

I then took things in my own hands and tried everything under the sun to boost my T. And yes, I was lean and athletic and always have been. It's due to an inefficiency in my brain (GNRH related). Anyway, nothing worked including HCG and Clomid restart and I ended up doing TRT (medically-supervised) and I felt alive within weeks. I swear, I hadn't felt that good in **YEARS.**

I did a lot of experimentation backed by blood work and found that high normal test + high normal **DHT** works incredibly well for me. DHT literally obliterates my anxiety. When I took Finasteride, which decreases DHT, guess what happened? Anxiety was horrible.

**3)** Gut tensing. Without noticing, I've had a bad habit for the longest time to suck my gut in/tense my stomach. This makes my already shitty breathing worse and guess what? Your brain senses this and anxiety increases. When I relax my gut, I feel instantly better.

**4)** Gut dysbiosis - This is a catch-22 situation. Cause my anxiety somatizes in the form of digestive issues and bloating but this can exacerbate anxiety. When I improve my digestion, anxiety is better.

**5) Supplement -** Phenibut is what worked for me. Makes sense as it has to do with GABA receptors.

**Solutions:**

1- Work with a professional who specializes in CBT and other proven frameworks.

2- If you suffer from low testosterone (legitimately low), address it ASAP! It's also not good for your overall health. Speaking from experience. Try everything to boost your natural testosterone levels first.

3- Fix your digestion. Avoid foods that you're sensitive to.

4- Try Phenibut.

5- Relax your gut. Stretching will help if you have a naturally tight core like me.

6- If your job is too stressful, try to change it if you can. **Life > money**. I have walked away from amazing jobs that were incredibly stressful. Not worth it.

7- Fix your breathing ailment. For me, I plan on getting my nose fixed soon. I can't live with subpar breathing anymore.

8- Be cautious with stimulants especially caffeine. This causes a cascade of internal events that upregulates the fight or flight mode = worse anxiety

**Supplement Recommendations**

I tried L-theanine and magnesium but not sure if they did much. Any recommendations here?",1753805330.0,2,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcfk5u/20_years_with_anxiety_heres_what_worked_for_me_it/,2025-07-29 16:08:50+00:00
1mc9p8b,How do I stop feeling emotionally disconnected?,"Idk if this is the right place to post, I started taking sertraline ( 25mg for 2 weeks ) for my anxiety and for like 10 days I felt like an absolute zombie, now I feel better, I’m able to do things for myself in life and I feel real, but I feel so emotionally detached from people

I was hanging out with a friend and we were having fun but I just couldn’t get myself to really laugh. I can’t laugh at things I usually did like TV shows and reels. I can’t get myself to feel anything when I listen to my favourite songs. I know I love my friends but it just feels like a distant fact, I don’t actually feel it most of the time nowadays

There is this girl I really like but I barely feel anything now. She’s literally the best and she’s one of the very few people I talk to right now and she made me really laugh a few times this week which was rare for me. But I feel horrible and I feel like a fake person, I mean I feel like that with my friends too but friendships are a lot more low maintenance than relationships so i don’t overthink about that too much. I don’t miss her or anyone much anymore and I don’t feel like doing any typical romantic things all of a sudden- I feel nothing. How am I supposed to figure out my feelings when I feel numb and distant? 

I first started feeling a bit of numbness before medication when I was really anxious about the girl. My brain used to overthink about everything, and Im the type to disconnect instinctively when I think I’ll get hurt. But this time it’s the nicest girl ever, I want things to workout with her but idk how if I’m all disconnected. I told her I feel numb and she still doesn’t care but I don’t want to hurt her in any way. I’d normally be the type to obsess over someone for 2 weeks and then get disgusted by their flaws but I really like this girl, I just don’t feel it rn but I really want it to work. It’s worse when people say stuff like ‘if it’s the right person you won’t need to think of all this’ cause I feel nothing 

Sometimes I do feel emotions but they’re always just anxiousness or sadness and nothing happy, I broke my Apple Watch yesterday and actually felt bad about it for a second. 

Is there any way I can stop feeling like this? I used to hate being connected to people but I’ve realised that just means I experience no real happiness, I want to feel now.

1mcl8o8,Is Wellbutrin/Bupropion the right drug,"For context, 51 m. I've been diagnosed with GAD and mild depression. This started all about 2.5 years ago when my sons left for college. When it really hit bad I was crying every day it seemed like. I was still able to work (from home) and function throughout the day, but I would ruminate, come to this sub, listen to podcasts to learn, but there would always be this underlying sense that something is wrong. It's still there.

About 1.5 years ago my Dr started me on Wellbutrin 300XL, and that seemed to calm me down day to day. I went off for a little bit a couple of months ago when I thought I was ""better."" However, the ruminations/crying were really bad for some reason on the weekends, or whenever my sons were home. It all stems from a fear of abandonment I have. So, here we are, still having overwhelming emotional episodes at least once a week, typically Sunday. Monday is like a hangover day, and then I'm generally right as rain until the weekend again. 

I'm meeting with my counselor and I've asked my doctor, but I'm wondering is Wellbutrin the right drug? My dr told me that Wellbutrin is really good for depression. I was on Zoloft first, but that was a nightmare. All of the side effects with none of the relief. 

What are your experiences? What do your drugs do for you? In general I can and will always get out of bed, go work out, walk the dog and work from home.

but yesterday the suicidal thoughts were getting so much more intense and i really thought i was going to do something. so i drank like 4 beers and hit my pen some. i was expecting to feel guilty/gross and wake up feeling even more depressed like i have before. the moment was good and i was able to actually talk and think mostly straight. 

but i woke up with the least anxiety ive had since i can remember. even tho i woke up 5 minutes before i had to leave i wasn’t sweaty and actually level headed. my driving anxiety didn’t have my tensed over my steering wheel. and i wasn’t pouring sweat doing simple tasks at work. i was actually able to remember things i needed to do and was able to conversate😭😭 like that’s what just blows my mind because i thought i ruined my social skills forever. normally im in a horrible mood especially when i have so much free time. normally i have constant suicidal thoughts and feel shame saying literally anything. i get so tense when i can tell people are watching me make their food but today i barely cared at all. normally my forehead hurts all day from having my eyebrows or something up. when this new coworker talked to me i didn’t feel guilty and self disgust/unworthiness. i was able to clean without going back and forth and making things harder on myself like i normally do in the morning getting ready. today there was an idiot golf cart on the road and i didn’t feel completely out of control going past them. i haven’t felt this way in such a long time. 

im really scared to get back into a cycle of addiction when drinking/smoking is what amplified my natural anxiety so much. i want to ask my parents if they can help me get meds because i cant believe this is just how people feel everyday. im afraid i wont because i hate that burden feeling but i will see. i just feel so much more levelheaded ",1753817559.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcl3ch/tw_alcoholweed/,2025-07-29 19:32:39+00:00

I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and suddenly my heart rate spiked to 145 bpm. I felt shortness of breath, dizziness, a choking sensation, and an intense fear of dying.
I was rushed to the ER. They did an ECG and bloodwork and told me everything was fine physically.
But from that moment on, I haven’t felt like myself.
I no longer experience full-blown panic attacks like on the first day, but now I live with constant pressure in my chest, emotional numbness, and fatigue.
It feels like I’m stuck in the “post-crisis” phase  afraid of having another episode, feeling lost, and disconnected from myself.
I’ve seen multiple doctors and they all said I’m physically healthy… but inside, I feel like I’m just existing in a body without truly living.
I’m trying my best to stay strong, but I’m tired.
I just want to feel normal again. I want to wake up one day and not have to fight this invisible battle.

1mcjcul,Chronically single or asexual? A long one but please read - anxiety developed in the aftermath of shit circumstances,"
hey guys, 

I kinda just need a safe space. 

The last year/18 months have been absolute hell for me for so many personal, health, societal, so many reasons. I feel almost a shell of the person I was 2 years ago. I am now so anxious, my mind spirals so quickly, I can’t get my thoughts under control, and sometimes I worry myself in my brain so intensely it just spirals and spirals. 

I’m currently having a bit of a sexuality crisis. For context I’m 25f, straight, chronically single, one of only brown girl in white town in UK, very small town. School was interesting, but the run down was, I have always been and will always be a hopeless romantic, ive always imagined my partner and I having a meet cute and well yeh, but at school it didn’t go to plan. Nobody was interested in me, I looked different from everyone else, stereotypes and racism was quite rampant, I had female platonic friends who showered me with love and understood me and made me feel appreciated,  but nothing romantic, nobody wanted to date me, no crushes I had were reciprocated, nobody made me feel desirable or attractive or loveable. And I guess it gave me a complex. I still live in this town now, so no surprise when I tell you I haven’t ended up having much dating experience even now.

Because I’ve been so repeatedly shot down in the past and made to feel like the ugly duckling or the butt of the joke - I almost feel those things are really true. I haven’t dreamt of forming these relationships as much. And tbh it’s been hell. It seems so far away from reality that someone would like me like that. 

Flash forward to now - I’m doing better and am out the other side of most my problems. Had some pretty serious health issues, got made redundant from my job, lost someone close to me so was grieving, had to move house. It completely derailed my life tbh and I was in a bad place. 

From there I started worrying non stop, mainly about my health and work and money, but those things were out of my control- then I fell into the deep dark depths of Reddit and started worrying about intrusive thoughts, they’ve spiraled into thoughts about my sexuality and other more sensitive darker topics. 

Anyway, I was reading the other day and when a character mentioned they were asexual it sent me into a spiral. Because I’ve been so used to protecting myself and my feelings in the aftermath of my teenage years, I haven’t allowed myself to form these connections with men. I’m scared to date and experience all of these things for the first time, I want to lose my virginity and date and do these things but also, it’s terrifying. After constantly being told I’m not peoples ’cup of tea’ how will anyone find me desirable. 

I guess it bought me to the asexual question. Since I’ve had such a lack of dating experience at 25, no first kiss no intimate moments etc, how can I truly know I’m not asexual? I haven’t had a crush on any one in a really long time (still live in shitty small town) - I don’t really encounter new men that often. I don’t remember the last time i genuinely saw a man I fancied. Celebrities and fictional people yes. I know a lot of it is my environment, perhaps if i relocated or looked wider or downloaded an app maybe it would change - but that’s also my fear of rejection speaking. 

I guess what I’m saying is, I also worry I could be asexual. I have no problems masturbating, self pleasure, I find men hot, I always have. They’ve been at the forefront of my sexual fantasies and at the porn I watch. BUT reading comments where where people are like ‘if you see a man and don’t wanna rip his clothes off’ it means you aren’t asexual. You must have an almost PRIMAL desire to want to shag men. But I haven’t seen a real man I felt like that about in a long time. My circle is small and I’m only just getting back to work after a year of unemployment and being inside- I don’t remember the last time I encountered a new man. But could all of this just be the fact subconsciously I’m uninterested? 

Is my fear of rejection and being unloveable and my scaredness of dating and experiencing all of this for the first time actually just that I don’t want it? I don’t know. I guess I’m just adding another thing into the list of things I’m worried about. I think I’m just questioning myself constantly and can’t turn my brain off. 

I’ve always dreamt of the typical life, I’ve found men hot, wanted freaky sex and a life together and to travel and do all of these things- well so I thought, but why hasn’t any of that happened yet? I have friends that have moved to cities that have casual sex and just wonder why that isn’t me. 

Idk, can anyone help a girl out and just give me some advice and thoughts ??? I’m really going through the wringer and can’t quiet my brain and at times it’s so hard for me to not worry about ‘what I am’.  If anyone’s had similar type issues snowball from anxiety lmk. 

(and yes, I acknowledge that from some of my previous posts, I do sound like I need to talk to someone. Perhaps a therapist. I get it I do. I am working on it and that is the end goal but right now strangers on the internet - allbeit I’ve had my fair share of weird messages - seem a safer space, I’ve only been able to articulate these things in recent months so yeh- pls don’t make me feel bad obviously needing to speak t someone, I’m getting there).

1mcja55,how do i get out of fight or flight???,"I have always kind of been an anxious person, socially awkward and nervous, but never to the point where I couldn't leave my house or drive. For reference I am 23F and healthy as far as I know

Fast forward, about a month ago I had my first panic attack that sent me to the doctor. I was having bad chest pains and my heart was racing. There they prescribed me Lexapro, which I stopped after day 3 because it made my anxiety absolutely worse and my whole body was tingling/shaking. That caused me to go to the ER, where they said my chest pain was from acid reflux and inflammation, on top of my anxiety. They gave me acid reflux medicine which I have been taking every day since. I even started therapy, because I honestly am too scared to even try another anxiety medication at this point. I can tell the acid reflux has lessened but not all the chest pain is gone.

  
Now I have the worst health anxiety. I go into a spiral when my heart rate increases or my chest hurts, or literally any change in how my body feels, I start to panic. It has even caused me to wake up in the middle of the night shaking, heart racing, thinking the world is ending.

  
How do I get my body out of this fight/flight/freeze mode I am in?? It's like I can almost feel the adrenaline in my stomach & chest, making it hard to keep my appetite. I have started exercising more, meditating, and therapy. All which help in the moment, but as soon as I'm done, the panic/anxiety comes back. It doesn't help that I work at a desk all day so i have nothing but time to sit there and think about all the sensations my body is feeling and over think them.

  
Do I try medication again?? Do I try to stick it out with exercise and therapy and hope it helps?? I feel lost.

1mcj2zh,It is getting worse day by day,"First Feeling:
It feels wavy and floaty, almost like there are small earthquakes happening. Every time, I feel like I’m going to pass out and die. It definitely sounds like anxiety—but I have anxiety, and this is just not the same. It causes anxiety, sure, but that feels more like a symptom of how overwhelming everything is, not the root cause.
When it happens, I panic more, and it becomes hard to breathe.

Second Feeling:
I feel like my heart is beating way too strongly, I can’t breathe properly, and I fear I’m going to die.

Third Feeling:
I feel dizzy, like I’m going to pass out. Sometimes I also feel nauseous.

This keeps happening to me, and it scares me. But what scares me even more is knowing it’s likely to happen during one of my most important upcoming exams. I’ve already ruined two exams because of this, and I’m terrified it’ll happen again and ruin this one too.

It’s also affecting my preparation. Just thinking that it could happen during the exam makes everything worse.

I’ve seen a psychiatrist, had my heart checked, and even ended up in the emergency ward once. I’m on medication, but nothing seems to help—it still keeps happening.

1mcc6uy,"ADHD—I'm on a path to disaster, and see no way forward","
I was recently diagnosed ADHD-PI, and with that came a violent shift in perspective on my life. And it's not pretty.

I realized I've opted out of everything difficult my whole life—Got a useless art degree, gave up on a driver's license and worked retail jobs.

Even on slower days, there was nothing left of me after a shift (probably in large part because of social masking, and going into mental overdrive to not make mistakes). It was soul crushing, and from day one I desperately looked for a way out.

When my workplace shut down, I took my chance, and with some luck I've managed to live off investing for the last 5 years. The freedom was irresistible, and the alternative unthinkable. I was happy.

With the diagnosis, my naive bubble finally popped: I can't keep this up forever. I'll have to get a job. The gap in my resume is a chasm. And while I'm not proud to say it, the idea of giving up my freedom, forever this time, fills me with dread. How the hell can I ever be happy again, knowing I'll never have what I had? And perhaps worse, I no longer want anything, other than to stay with my girl.

There's also my relationship. We've been together, very happily, for over a decade, and I'm realizing I'm nowhere near ready or capable of being a parent, deal with home ownership, and many other parts of adult life. I can barely keep from being overwhelmed as it is. The thought of losing her to my ADHD is alone enough to paralyze me with fear. She's the one.

This has all come down on me so hard and fast I'm soaked in anxiety and stress every day, and this has wrecked my sleep. I manage one or two hours before I'm wide awake again. With unsustainable sleep medication I manage 4-5h, but the cortisol rise at 4am rouses me awake, and at 8am it's enough to make me spasm with anxiety. This has in turn made all my ADHD symptoms so much worse; I can't pay attention, learn or make a decision for the life of me anymore. I can barely see through the brain fog. This of course further feeds the stress and anxiety. Adding in ADHD medication at this point is likely to further mess with my already ruined sleep.

And since I can't help but catastrophize, it seems all but inevitable that my sleep issues, stress, anxiety and the exacerbated ADHD would be even worse and immediately trip up any work opportunities I might miraculously get.

With all this, I am truly despairing. I don't know how to move forward, how to feel safe enough to sleep again, or if there's even a path back to happiness. Disaster is around the corner, and I fear the absolute worst. I'm genuinely scared.

Any help or perspective is appreciated.",1753797558.0,2,2,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcc6uy/adhdim_on_a_path_to_disaster_and_see_no_way/,2025-07-29 13:59:18+00:00

What if I stay like this? With that 'somethings wrong but I'm not sure exactly what and how to fix it' feeling?

I'm only 15. I don't want to be dealing with these things. I hate myself and I hate the media. I don't even want to admit the reason for my anxiety. I kinda did to my mom. She said she'll love me no matter what, but I really don't think she would if I told her the truth.

I know I'm overthinking it. I know I'm not a bad person. I know what I'm scared of is just a fear and isn't true, but how do I convince myself of that? How do I genuinely believe it?

I was supposed to enjoy this summer. June was so good, I was so happy. I haven't wanted to die in 2/3 months, I'm scared I'm falling deeper into a bad mental space again. 

I hate this so much. What happened? Why now? Why remember now? 

This whole July I've been anxious. Some days so anxious I wasn't able to do much because I felt sick. Couldn't eat, move, think. Just lie down and try to distract myself. 

Every time I finally feel good again and feel like the anxiety is gone my mind finds something to worry about. 


""What are those marks on your friend? Are they scars? Is she salfharming? What's going on?"" 

""Oh turns out the author of the books this series you saw one episode of is based on is an alleged rapist! Are you supporting him? Weren't you genuinely interested?"" 

""Oh, remember when you heard something about your once favourite author being a bad person? This authors books have shaped you, so what now? Are you supporting them? Will you ever be able to enjoy the books ever again?"" 

""Remember that one thing you last did months ago? Did you enjoy that? So are you a bad person now? Are you any better then your own abuser?"" 


Mom recommended we sign up for a doctor visit. Idk if I want to do that. I mean I do, what if I get diagnosed with something and finally get help? 

But then I'll have to tell the doctor your real fears, your real thoughts, the truth. 

I hate this so so much. I hate to say this because I want to live a life, but I want to die. I finally got the taste of mental freedom and happiness and now feel like I'm getting that taken away from me, by myself. 

I hate this so much. 

I just want to feel normal again.

1mcgn8b,Working with fear of abandonment,"Hello,

For some context I (21M) have generalized anxiety disorder, adhd, and I’m on the spectrum (very very high functioning) and possibly some talk about mild OCD.

Ever since high school I’ve had the fear of being abandoned and honestly it’s only gotten worse since my girlfriend broke up with me a month ago (nothing I did, she has trauma to work on). My parents and siblings are on vacation right now out of state and I am home by myself watching the dogs and the house. I think it’s the silence that’s killing me since I’ve been in my head so much and have gone into many episodes, I’d call them mini crises because of the severity of them. It got so bad I had to go to the hospital yesterday to get some emergency PRNs (I had a prescriber but with how well I was doing we stopped seeing each other). I always had 0.25mg of Xanax for the bad ones so that’s what the er gave me. Anyway, I would like some tips from the people who have been through this, or anyone with wisdom to share. I absolutely HATE being alone, I have no clue why but I do and it always triggers something. I can handle short term like a day or two, but I have a week by myself here and I go to work from 2pm-10pm and to say it’s been hard is an understatement.

1mc869u,Starting to think how I feel every day isn’t actually normal?,"For as long as I can remember — even as a kid — I’ve felt wired and tense most of the day. Shallow breathing, mentally drained after work, overstimulated in group settings (though one-on-one feels fine). I usually come home just needing quiet and feel anxious or disconnected, while others seem totally fine doing the same job. I’m (23 years old atm)

Some days are a bit better, but most days I’m running on edge, and I’m starting to realize maybe that’s not normal.

I sleep 7–8 hours a night, get 8–10k steps daily, just started going to the gym, and work a regular 8-hour, 5-day week. So I should feel okay — but I don’t.

I’ve been taking magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and L-theanine, but they haven’t helped. If anything, I sometimes feel worse.

1mcg6yl,Does anyone else get episodes of anxiety?,"So I'm generally an anxious person, but not to the point that it interferes with my day to day life. I'm able to work, spend time with my wife and son, and even just chill and relax (game, watch movies, go for hikes, etc.)

But something that has been happening to me since I was 20 is I'll go through periods (usually anywhere from 2-3 weeks to almost a year when it first happened) where I'm super anxious and it does interfere with my life. I'm not quitting my job or not able to leave the house, but these periods (or episodes) I'm just constantly in fight or flight mode. I feel like there is an impending doom or I'm just going to die, not from anything in particular, but just like flat out die. It's such a weird sensation. It's like my mind is screaming ""it's coming for you!"" What ""it"" is? No idea whatsoever.

Anyways, long story short I always eventually come out of these episodes and I'm totally fine. I always say it's like when you're really sick for awhile and you think ""Man, when am I going to recover?"" and then you don't notice it and you just do and you look back and think ""oh yea, I was sick back then wasn't I? huh,"" and you just move on.

I've been going to therapy with a counselor since 2019 and they have helped me a ton when it comes educating me on what I'm going through and potential causes for each episode. I only recently started medication back in 2022 after being vary wary of meds for a long time. They seemed to have helped, but unfortunately I'm in the midst of another anxious episode that started.

1mbi046,What's the most oddly specific thing that triggers your anxiety that you can't explain to others?,"Mine is when apps crash or freeze while I'm using them. Not just mild annoyance like actual panic level anxiety. Like when netflix starts buffering or my phone lags during a game I get this immediate fight or flight response that's completely disproportionate to the situation. I think it's because entertainment apps have become my go to coping mechanism for stress so when they malfunction it feels like losing my safety net. But try explaining to someone that your phone freezing gives you the same anxiety as being trapped in an elevator and they look at you like you're insane. Also weirdly triggered by notification sounds when I'm not expecting them. My own phone notifications are fine but hearing someone else's text alert in a quiet room makes my heart race. It's like my brain interprets random notification sounds as some kind of emergency even when they're not mine. The worst is when I'm watching something and get the ""weak connection"" message.

1mcfpl9,Anyone Else Experiencing Significant Drop in HR During Sleep? - Low heart rate notifications (Apple Watch),"Hi everyone,

Im a 25 old male, 187cm tall and 85 kg. 

I’ve been monitoring my heart rate with Apple Watch SE for 2,5 years. Recently, I’ve noticed a sudden and consistent drop in night-time heart rate, often around 44-46 HR, sometimes dipping below 42 HR, especially between 6-7 AM (mostly always at the same period of the night, few hours before waking up)

What’s strange:

– During the 1st year of monitoring, I was very consistant in my physical activity / training and used to sleep at 50-55 HR. No dip under 50 was recorded. 

– Now, I’ve been sedentary for 8 months due to work stress and anxiety (university + job), yet my night-time HR is lower than ever. That feels counterintuitive.

– When I wake up I feel tired, foggy, and a bit nauseous in the mornings. It lasts for few hours then pass. 

– My daytime HR is higher around 65-80 HR, which makes the gap night/day unusual compared to when I was training and healthier. 

1 month ago I went to see my cardiologist because for the past few month, I experienced some daytime HR high spikes and sorts of panic attack (heart going up to 160 for no particular reason then dropping slowly to 100 HR ) and was sometimes feeling sorts of skipped beat - But without any pain or faint. 

He then proceeds to do a 24h Holter, which returned normal (no arrhythmias, no pauses or concerning events). He suggested I might be sensitive to adrenaline, but nothing serious was found. 

Since then, I’ve now had multiple low-HR alerts from the Apple Watch (set at 45 HR) and I’m worried about potential undiagnosed sinus node dysfunction or vagal/autonomic issues.

Anyone experienced similar patterns with HR dropping progressively (on a 2 month period) during sleep while being non-athletic and mostly sedentary ?

Any advice on next steps or if I should ask for longer Holter / sleep study?

Thanks for sharing your experiences.",1753805661.0,1,4,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcfpl9/anyone_else_experiencing_significant_drop_in_hr/,2025-07-29 16:14:21+00:00
1mcfmob,Nocturnal panic attacks and overnight flight,"I am leaving Thursday night on my honeymoon, flying from New York to Rome. I am beyond excited for the trip but am equally terrified. 

I get occasional (few times a month on average) nocturnal panic attacks. I wake up about an hour after falling asleep with cold sweats, neausea, racing heart and an overwhelming sense of doom. 

At home, the best thing for me is I get out of bed and lie on the cold bathroom floor. Within 10-15 minutes I’m usually okay enough to go back to my bed and then am so exhausted from the panic attack I fall asleep within a half hour after that. 

I have a general fear of flying and sleep is a huge anxiety trigger for me. Does anyone have suggestions on how to get some sleep on an overnight flight while avoiding a panic attack?

1mc5qul,"Severe ocd causing depression, scared to fix anything anymore.","I’m going through something terrible, I had a massive nervous breakdown a little over two months ago, since then I’ve been in what feels like hell mentally. I’m extremely unstable , some days feel like things might be making a turn around.. then out of nowhere the next day is terrible. I spent weeks in a constant panicked state to the point where I was driving to the hospital trying to go in but just kept turning around and going home because it made it worse. 

I have severe social anxiety to the point where I’ve isolated myself away from everyone except my girlfriend who lives with me and my family who lives right beside me. I still talk to my friends on the phone somedays , but I can’t manage to want them to come around me because of my instability & the fact that I can’t go to them right now. I rarely am able to leave the house because I start panicking on the road and come home immediately. I started therapy with an OCD specialist a month and a half ago and quit because the video calls were causing extreme anxiety for me & I couldn’t tolerate it at the time. She suggested medication, which of course I’m scared of too. 

As a result of this my sleep schedule is extremely backwards right now, going to bed at 8-10am and waking up at 5-6pm. It’s miserable, I have so much ocd centered around sleep that it’s hard to mess with this because when I do It flares me up worse.

On top of this all of this recent flaring and changes has made me extremely depressed. I feel subhuman because of my inability to move toward anything positive in my life. I feel like I develop a new fear every single day.. I don’t know what to do or how to do it right. 

I seriously have no life, I wake up and sit around the house all day trying to find something “fun” to do.. trying to do positive things for my body and health and this is all I can think about. I truly feel like nothing I do is enough, and it’s all by force to try and “get better”

1mcessn,"Frustrated, general anxiety, severe PMS, no help.","I’m so incredibly frustrated. I have severe PMS. To the point of effecting my relationship. Along with it comes severe anxiety (I also have generalized anxiety). My gyno was no help. She suggested trying to increase my antidepressants the week before my period. I really don’t feel like the back and forth of dosage amounts is a normal/a great idea. Not to mention, my periods aren’t always regular so timing is an issue. 

I’ve tried exercise, therapy, meditation,  hydroxyzine, propranolol, buspirone, all the things. I have been prescribed Xanax in the past and it’s the only thing that kicks the anxiety right in the moment and allows me to function. I’ve never abused it and never took it regularly (as in every day). Just when I absolutely needed it. And, honestly, sometimes just knowing it was there if I needed it was enough for me to calm down a bit. 

I have an appt today with my primary to address a different issue I’m having but wanted to discuss other options for my anxiety as well. I’m frustrated because I feel like I would benefit from having that safety net of a benzo. But I’m always terrified of coming off as a drug seeker to him.

1mcejbb,Used to Consistent Panic Attacks,"Hi, gonna try to make this short and to the point: I have very bad anxiety and ADHD, have been taking Vyvanse for a few years. I just started Wellbutrin a week ago.

Could it be that I have been experiencing consistent panic attacks (shortness of breath, trembling, hot flashes) to the point that I feel like that's my normal state? Because I feel shortness of breath more often than not, and have been for as long as I can remember. I know what it feels like to not have shortness of breath, and it feels like my abdomen looses it's tension and I feel like my lungs stretch really far. It feels really nice and I always notice when it happens. I tend to feel this on occasion after I drink a little alcohol (I drink responsibly)

I do admit that I tend to ignore a lot of my body's warning signs because it's really tedious to adhere to every single one of them when I have life to experience/deal with. Like I am not going to not go out on a hike because my hands are shaking, or not go to work because I feel adrenaline. That's just how I normally feel, so if I were to listen to every flag raised, I'd be incapacitated in bed literally 24/7, because these things r just the norm. I have Lupus as well, so brain fog and lack of clarity is also involved in this. I got cats to take care of and laundry to do, yknow?

I've learned that I don't really know what normal feels like, so if someone who has experienced both sides could teach me a thing or two here, it would help me out a ton (especially while I traverse the start of my Wellbutrin journey)

He also has OCD, anxiety, and depression, which worsened after the pandemic. Watching his decline has triggered anxiety in me.

He tries every morning to quit but ends up drinking by evening after work. A while back, he fell down while drunk, fractured his skull, and had to be hospitalized. It was a very serious case. Still, the cycle continues. He once asked me to help him stick to his meds, but when I reminded him recently, he lashed out and stopped talking to me. My therapist advised me not to force him, but I feel so helpless.

I am moving abroad soon, and with our ageing parents, I constantly worry. I fear he won’t be able to handle a crisis if something happens to them. I am also scared he might develop a serious illness due to his drinking, especially after a close acquaintance recently passed away from pancreatic cancer.

We have tried psychiatrists, therapists, and medications. Nothing has really helped. Rehab is not an option. My own anxiety is getting worse, and it is affecting my relationship with my husband. I know my interference is pushing my brother away, but I can’t seem to detach emotionally.

Those 2 months have nothing but stabilised and solidified our relationship for the better but as of recently I feel a bit different. Every time I think about her, talk with her or even look at her I get this inner pressure that makes me want to cry. I'm considering if I'm catching serious feelings for her or if it's my own feeling of inadequacy to her but not quite sure.

1mcbjaz,Extreme adult separation anxiety,"I have had separation anxiety for as long as I can remember and it is crippling. I guess I never “outgrew” it as a child. I used to have it towards my parents but when I got married, it carried over to my spouse as he travels a few times a year. Now that I am a mom, it has went away towards my husband and is now towards my son. It consumes me. I hate traveling, I hate being away from him. I am going away with my husband for 2 nights (driving 5 hours) in a couple weeks and I am literally spiraling already. We had to cancel our trip last month due to illness and I was relieved. I just want to be normal. I want to be able to enjoy the time away with my husband to reconnect. I know logically that it is a short time away from my son. We gave him the choice to come with us or go with his grandparents who he adores and is with during the week as my husband and I both work. I am so proud of him for choosing to go with them and not suffering like I do. When I was younger, I hated staying with my grandparents due to my anxiety and just wanted my parents. The last thing I want is for my son to know how bad this affects me. I want him to have a wonderful time with his grandparents. I know  he will be in good hands but as someone who has general anxiety disorder as well, I worry about all the what ifs that can happen. I also feel like I’m going to miss him so terribly. I want so badly to enjoy this time away with my husband, he needs this too. I just can’t get over this depression I feel over it.

I’m doing a bit of research to better understand the kinds of thoughts people struggle with—especially the harsh, judgmental, or unhelpful ones that pop up in your head when you’re stressed, stuck, or feeling low.

If you’re open to sharing: What are the *exact words or phrases* your inner critic tends to say?

Not paraphrased or cleaned up, just raw, how it shows up in your mind.

Examples could be things like:

* “You’re so behind. Everyone else has figured it out.”
* “You always mess things up.”
* “don't be a burden you shouldn't ask for help .”

No pressure to explain or justify—just the quotes themselves are super helpful.

This is for a project I’m working on around self-esteem and what modalities can help.

1mca3ab,Anxiety and Job Offers,"Hi everyone, recently my long term girlfriend broke up with me so I wanted a change in my life in order to get over her. I applied to a lot of jobs and eventually landed 2 good job offers. They were both jobs I wanted and I was excited when I got the job offer emails but then I self sabotaged and rejected them both. I emailed them saying I had personal problems I was going through currently and if it was possible to reapply to other positions in the future but I received no reply. I was too anxious to start any job and too lazy to do all the pre-employment requirements.  
  
 Idk if its because of my anxiousness or depression but I feel like I'm ruining my life for no reason. I just feel like a loser and a failure right now and I'm scared that I won't ever find jobs as good as those since I'm not really applying for anything specific too.

My friends are telling me to take my time and heal but I feel like I'm getting left behind. I've been working at my family business these past couple of years but I haven't really learned anything and the salary I get is really low. It just feels like I'm never going to be able to have a good enough future to fulfill my dreams and get the things I want. 

Right now all I'm doing is taking my newly prescribed meds and bed rotting all day. Kinda lost hope in my future and I don't really have any desire to change for the better. Really really want to give up.

Generally, I think if an object/service is expensive and the value is high, that's ok, but if the object/service is expensive and the value is low, that's not ok.

Getting to the point, I've seen 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists in the past 13 years for chronic mental health challenges and I'm not convinced of the value. I'm seeing a new psychologist this week and I'm a bit apprehensive. Not about the experience (I'm a pretty open book), but about whether there's value in it. Mental health care in Australia is quite expensive, even with the Mental Health Care Plan rebate, so thinking about it in terms of cost vs. benefit and I'm not 100% convinced it's worth the time and money.

1mc9dcw,Effexor for anxiety/social anxiety - worried about side effects after first dose??,"Hi everyone,  
I wanted to ask for some advice or shared experiences about Effexor (venlafaxine), especially for anxiety and social anxiety.

I tried 75mg once (extended release) a while back and had an intense reaction — I didn’t sleep a single minute that night and felt super wired like I was on a recreational stimulant, had jaw clenching/grinding, and ended up having my first proper panic attack the next day. It really scared me, so I stopped right away.

Now I’m reconsidering trying a lower dose (37.5mg), but I’m nervous. I’m a highly sensitive person, have some past trauma from drug experiences (weed/MDMA/psychadelics) that left me hypervigilant, and I suspect I may be autistic. I’m worried about persistent insomnia or overstimulation happening again, especially because sleep is already fragile for me.

I’m wondering:

Has anyone had a bad first experience on 75mg and done better on 37.5mg?

Did it help with your anxiety/social anxiety in the long run?

Any tips for managing the early side effects, especially if you’re very sensitive?

I really want to find something that helps, but I’m scared to mess up my nervous system even more.

1mc9c48,Attending a culturally different wedding,"Hey everyone,

As the title hints, I am attending my partner's (M28) brother wedding. We have been together for well over 2 years now (got a house, cats and a future together) and so his family knows me as we met couple times or stayed over at theirs.

The thing is that, my partner is British and his family is that type that I have always imagined exists only in like Bridgerton style books etc. I on the other hand am Czech (coming from a small quite poor city as well, so imagine a true slavic girl). And even tho this might sound a bit bizarre or like a perfect romance novel motive, I'm genuinely getting more and more anxious about attending the wedding. 

There has been a couple things over the past few months that gave me the idea of what kind of wedding is this gonna be. The fact that it's going to be in a massive Abbey, the after lunch hosted in a big venue, three/four course meal for everyone, my partners mom asking me if im planning on wearing a hat (I mean...HAT ? Like I've never even thought about it), the groom being very strict about male guest wearing tailcoats (again...I had to Google what is a tailcoat lol). So in short, I got a feeling from all of this that it's going to be a bit of an aristocracy style wedding. Which is actually pretty cool because I've never seen anything like that..

BUT

I'm starting to be terrified on making some sort of mistake, saying something wrong. Also, my arms are covered in tattoos, I got two nose piercings and yeaaaah a minor slavic accent and I'm just getting anxious af :))) I'm trying to get ready as much as possible to fit in, got a very modest pink dress (length under knees as that was also one of the requirements), I'm planning on buying a vape (because obviously as a  true slavic girl, I smoke a bit, but got the idea that that's not acceptable for this occasion so I'll occasionally hide at toilets with my little vape), having my nails done, haircut and everything you can possibly think of. 

I just...yeah I don't know I think is a mix of being nervous, excited about experiencing something completely new to me, anxious for not fitting in in the slightest and -  I am very happy with how I am, how I look and act and everything, but objectively I recognise that it is very different to what this wedding and the whole culture of my partners family is.

I guess I just needed to vent that out. So thanks for reading x",1753789937.0,1,0,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc9c48/attending_a_culturally_different_wedding/,2025-07-29 11:52:17+00:00

Whenever I get anxious, this feeling grows — like I want someone to hit me so I can feel it harder, even though I don’t *like* that. It’s not about liking pain, it’s just that something in me feels like it *needs* that release. It’s scary and exhausting.

When I was a kid, I used to hurt myself — punching, biting, hitting my head against a wall. I even hit my foot with a spoon once when I was angry at my mom. I eventually stopped, but these thoughts still come back sometimes. I don’t act on them anymore, but they’re always there in the background.

Right now, I feel like if I could just cry, I’d feel a little better. But I live in a joint family, and there’s no private space to let it out. It feels like everything is just trapped inside me.

I don’t know if anyone will understand this, but if you’ve felt anything like this — or even if you haven’t — I’d really appreciate someone to talk to or just hear me.

1mc7q9a,"I’m not sure what’s going on with me, please advice","Hi everyone, I have steadily over the course of a few years developed like major anxiety around illness. It probably started around 3-4 years ago when my firstborn started daycare and was sick weekly from September until February. Then * I * started getting sick even more often than my kids and found out I might be some type of immune compromised.  

It’s gotten so bad that I can’t comfort my children when they have even a low grade fever because I feel like I’m going to die and I’m terrified of getting sick. I also **have** to knock on wood whenever something about illness is spoken about or else I “just know” it’s going to be a jinx and actually going to happen (for example I was at the rheumatologist yesterday and had to knock on wood like 10+ times whenever he asked me if something hurt and it didn’t actually hurt (yet)). My husband joked about lying about one of the kids being sick to get us out of going to a family bbq (outdoors and not many people) and then my daughter literally got sick that day and I just KNOW it’s because he even said that out loud. 

I also won’t go to family parties or concerts or a bar any event where I know I’ll be breathing people’s air or squished up against people for a prolonged period of time. Ive resorted to taking Xanax to even help me sleep because I’m too wired and anxious to rest (not every night don’t worry). My hands are cracking from using hand sanitizer like 50 times a day whenever I touch something that my daughter may have touched (she has a fever right now which sparked this current freak out of mine). 

I was diagnosed with GAD back when I was 17 or 18 (28 now) but this is the worse I’ve experienced. I also had 2 miscarriages and a severe illness this year that I’m still recovering from, and I’m convinced something is medically wrong ALL THE TIME. I’ve started therapy but hasn’t done much of anything yet. Any advice on how to make it through this day to day???

**EDIT TO ADD** 
 - I also was prescribed lexapro and Wellbutrin from my PCPs to try to help with my anxiety, but I can’t take them. I’m convinced that if I take them it’ll make me feel sick and it’ll fuck up the chemicals in my brain. I have constant tension headaches from the lack of sleep and from constantly clenching my jaw SO hard. When I realize I’m doing it, I stop but like a minute later I’m back to it. I HAVE to cook almost all of my food from scratch or else it’s going to get me sick. The exception is Oreos for some reason. But even then I only have one Oreo per day because they’re processed and I’m convinced they’ll hurt me.

1mbmtli,Anxiety stole my life,"Hey, so I've been thinking about this a lot and just need some advice. Four years ago I changed basically everything, I've finished my bachelors in psychology, got into my dream art academy I was afraid to pursue, basically I had everything going well. Then I had struggled with so much anxiety I broke apart and basically got stuck in my bed staring at the phone 12 hours a day, not going out not doing anything. I was also sort of betrayed by the Church, dealing with a lot of trauma from that and also a few bad relationships. I tried to do everything therapy, pills, prayers... all of it worked just very slowly. In this process I lost a lot of confidence, all sources of income and I was back at the uni in my hometown living in my parents house. Now three years later I was able to fly for the first time, see the ocean, do a lot of things that might come naturally to many people, but for me it was an uphill battle rather than a vacation. I fear there is no way out of this. I am 26F now and I have no relationship and no money, no prospects, am becoming a burden to my parents and I'm scared. Can anyone tell me there is a way out? Is it antidepressants? Is it prayer, working out, therapy? Idk what to do.

TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts

So I have severe OCD, and my main fear is being an abuser or predator. Like. I do ANYTHING I can to make sure I am never that way. It’s called POCD.

And today I saw a meme of an old model today talking about her boobs that made me feel really aroused and I went to… do the deed. 

I didn’t use that photo, only content that I was certain was 18+ by checking subreddit rules, but then after I started to spiral and it turns out the model that I initially felt aroused by started her career at 16, and I’m not sure if she was of age in the initial photo I saw. Now my intrusive thoughts are telling me the worst stuff ever.

From everything I can tell, she was probably 18 or 19 in the photo that I saw, but I hate that I don’t know for sure. Please please please help I am evil and hate myself I NEVER EVER EVER have had any attraction to anyone under the age of 18 and I really really really really hope that this wasn’t the worst case scenario because if it was I think I would actually probably kill myself.",1753728703.0,16,14,anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbotfm/ocd_destroying_me_over_something_that_happened/,2025-07-28 18:51:43+00:00

1mc5csv,Graduated but haven't used degree...,"There's plenty of posts out there about this - finishing a degree but not going on to use it/using it for something completely different.

Long story short I've determined that it's most likely social anxiety that's led to my 5 year dormancy and due to recent circumstances I've dug the degree grave up...

During my internship I would fear not being able to please the boss/couldn't sit still for long. This led to constant dissociation, which meant I couldn't absorb any new learnings, which exacerbated the loop etc. I did well at uni, but felt a bit imposter syndrome about it.

Fast forward 5 years, I've been working in a supermarket - cos it's all I have been able to handle. I now have an ADHD diagnosis, work through CPTSD with a therapist, and I'm at a point that's much more stable...almost boring. My rel. new partner has very gently dug up the degree grave and has given me the space to talk honestly about why I left, rather than 'it wasn't for me'.

Is there anyone whose been through something similar? If you eventually tried to go back, what did you do to 'patch' the gap in the resumé?

1mbn9af,My detailed journey with anxiety for the past 2 and a half years,"Thought I'll share a detailed journey of my GAD, including the symptoms, medicine and other experiences I've had a long the way.

Where it all began:  
A week after after having covid at the end of December of 2022 I suddenly felt weakness in my left leg and tightness in my chest along with some dizziness. At the time I had no idea what it was, I got super panicy and went to ER, where they of course told me that everything was fine and most likely it has something to do with anxiety. I'd never experienced any anxiety without a very clear reason for having one before that moment. The next day I felt super anxious and with tightness in my chest, of course worried crazy and thinking that I'm dying. I kept googling my symptoms and of course everything said that it's cancer or I'm having a heart problems or something else completely crazy. I got a full blood panel and general check-up that came back ok.

I went to see psychologist a month or so later, who immediately prescribed me Lexapro. Somehow things got worse pretty fast after starting the medicine. I was throwing up, waking up super early (5-6am) with nausea and strong anxiety. I was coping with that by going on long walks, that helped me start the day. Turned out I was super sensitive (and still am) to most antidepressants.

What helped:  
After trial and error I ended up taking Prozac from mid 2023 till March 2025. It took me 6 weeks for the medicine to actually start working and worst of the side effects to disappear. I struggled with waking up early with nausea for months, before I was prescribed Trazodone, that took around a week to get rid of this problem. From the end of 2023 until the December of 2024 I was more or less ok, very little anxiety but I felt also emotionless, felt like Prozac and Trazadone really made me just exist, but not live my life to the fullest, which of course, was better than the hell I went through before taking them.

Something changed:  
In December of 2024 I suddenly started having problems with falling asleep. I was super tired, but my body kept waking me up when dozing off, feeling like I need to move my body and it kept happening for hours before I finally fall asleep. My doc decided to stop Prozac as in general my anxiety was better and I also felt like I would be more like myself without the medicine. Because I'm sensitive to SSRI I was only taking 10mg, so I went to 5mg for several weeks and then stopped taking it, while still taking Trazadone for sleep. Well - here come the withdrawal effects. Random bursts of anxiety, sleepiness, digestive issues, nausea - every day was different. But what didn't changes was my sleep - I still had the issue of not falling asleep because of my body wanting to move, although brain almost sleeping. Next step was to stop Trazadone, as doc thought it might not be effective anymore and instead causeing this sleeping issue.

Now it's been roughly a month from stopping Trazadone and two months from stopping Prozac. My sleep is now even worse, instead of my body not allowing me to sleep, now it's my mind, tossing in bed for hours and finally falling asleep aroun 4am. This happens now every single night. I also have excessive daytime sleepiness, feeling sad and hopeless and of course a lot of anxiety.

Conclusion:  
I'm not yet healed. Far from it. I've made some stupid decisions, relying on medicine but not doing enough myself to help me heal. (and so have my doctors, constantly experimenting with doses of my medicines and not allowing me enough time to stabilise on single doze).

What I've learned is you cannot rely on medicine. It's a good helping tool, but please work on making changes to your lifestyle or your life in general. Even though I had moments where I felt like there is nothing wrong with my surrounding, making the smallest changes to my lifestyle have had tremendous effect. Even talking with the people close to me and letting people know what I'm going through will help you out long term.

A little bit about the anxiety symptoms and how I manage them:

1. Heavy feeling on the chest - DON'T GOOGLE IT, if you're really worried talk to your doctor and your doctor says your heart is fine then it's most probably fine. It is a known anxiety symptom and usually goes away once you're not thinking about it anymore :)
2. Dizziness - this happens to me on and off. Splashing some cold water on my face or putting something cold on my neck has been helpful.
3. Headaches - usually I get my headaches from my shoulder or neck, sometimes upper back. They can be really annoying and sometimes get pretty strong and painkillers might not help with them. A hot bath or a shower has been sometimes helpful for me and I usually get them only when startin SSRI as a side effect or during a withdrawal.
4. Pins and needles in hands - they come and go. But, they always eventually go away and are most likely related to the tension of the muscles, same as with the headache. Don't stress about it it's just a bit uncomfortable but you'll eventually forget that you've ever had this!
5. Nausea and no appetite (especially in the mornings) - this happens to me quite often - I still try to force something in, even if it's something small like yoghurt or a banana, I feel like it protects my stomach to have at least something in there.
6. Restlessness - try going for a walk and burning that energy. Getting out of home is important even though might seem very tough.
7. Low motivation - unless you REALLY need to get something done, it's sometimes OK to procrastinate and take it a bit slower. You're healing. Your brain is going through a lot, don't be too harsh on yourself. Setting deadlines might be very helpful in case you need to get something done.
8. Fatigue - ok this one is crazy, it comes in periods of weeks sometimes and I feel like my eyes are just closing as soon as I sit down. I've never felt so tired in my life and OF COURSE this boosts my anxiety by thinking there is something wrong with me. Eventually it just resolves on it's own like nothing ever happened... weird one.
9. Benzos - I do have Valium at home and use it ONLY in emergencies. It is a helpful thought to know that you have something to take the edge off the anxiety when it gets too bad, but sometimes just this thought is already good enough. Benzo addiction is a serious thing and please don't try risking it!

These panic/anxiety attacks consist of moderate to severe dissociation, hot flashes throughout my body, numbness and nausea along with impending doom as to what could happen if these feelings completely take over.

I’m talking, I have locked the front door but I now need to wiggle the handle for 5 seconds, back away from the door and then go back to the door for one final push on the handle. It’s like my brain doesn’t believe my eyes and my actions and is convinced I’ve not done something! 

I struggle with this for things like locking the front door, locking the car, closing the fridge, turning off the kitchen tap, turning lights off. Sometimes when I’m out I feel the need to constantly check inside my bag even if I did it 5 seconds earlier and saw and touched what I was looking for.

Cleaning the toilet is one that I feel like I cannot stop. After I’ve been to the toilet I always give it a wipe down - I’ll walk into my room and think ‘what if there are stains on the toilet’ so I’ll go back into the bathroom, see that there’s nothing there and go back into my room. However, I always end up having to go back and check the toilet again…  

I’m hoping that someone has any advice/tricks I could use, I feel like I’m losing it a little lol.

1mc4ki1,chronic dizziness from panic attacks,"okay, here it goes. it’s been almost a year of this hell and i’m finally ready to share my story. in september 2024, i drank caffeine by accident and got a major panic attack in the middle of costco. i hadn’t no idea until a few hours later but it was too late by then. after that, i started to get regular panic attacks every single day. every time i drove, just watching tv, or cooking dinner, it didn’t matter. without fail id have a panic attack. 
i’ve been getting panic attacks since i was 13 (im 25F now) so im not new to them, but this was the worst and most frequent i ever had them in my life. in october, it got so bad that i couldn’t drive, which meant i couldn’t get to school. i decided to take a week off and rest. big mistake. i spent a week in bed and still panicked every day. anxiety all day long. i got no rest. instead, i got slammed with physical symptoms ive never felt before. i’d be laying in bed and it felt like i was on a boat. walking to the bathroom and it felt like the floor beneath me was bouncy and my body was not my body. like i was floating above it or something. i got horrible tinnitus, never stops and its louder in my right ear. among other symptoms not worth mentioning cause they didn’t last through the winter like everything else ive mentioned. i was bed bound. i never returned to school. i barely showered and only got up to use the restroom. i was so useless, my girlfriend was fully supporting me. fast forward to january when i started to do exercises for my jaw and my neck hoping to find some relief. i started to feel so much better. maybe it’s my neck, or maybe it’s my jaw because i do have TMJ disorder. 
in february or march i started to get a few more symptoms, maybe related maybe not. i started to get heart palpitations, i feel them at least once a day, and i feel them more if im laying down on my left side. i also started getting really strange visual disturbances that are incredibly hard to describe but, if i move my hand against a dark background (my black comforter) my hand leaves a streak for just a second. it’s not still images and i can only see the streak if its in my peripheral vision. if im looking at my hand straight on i see nothing. and i only see it when the room is dim, not too bright and not too dark. if im outside in the bright sun, i dont notice this. this symptom scares the living crap out of me and i’m convinced i have a brain tumor with everything else going on. 
anyways, after i was feeling better i was able to help my girlfriend around the house more. a few more months go by and i needed to get rid of my agoraphobia if i ever wanted to finish my degree. i started going out again VERY slowly, and im finally able to go out with very little restrictions. i do take precautions to not get overstimulated but sometimes it happens and i have a panic attack. the important thing is that im doing it. i still have the swaying sensation, predominantly when im laying down but i can also feel it sitting or standing. i still have tinnitus, and when things are bad i still have bad DPDR. i also have a faster than im comfortable with heart rate when im standing, but i think that might be due to the fact that i spent so many months in bed. 
i’d love to know if anyone has a similar story. have you recovered? what did you do to get there? did you find something else wrong that was causing the symptoms? my anxiety tells me i have a brain tumor. i hope it’s wrong.
