18e3pnh,My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost. Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately. Can anybody clue me in on possibly causes or where to start?",1702090229.0,2023-12-09 02:50:29+00:00,2023,927,243,mentalhealth,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18e3pnh/my_daughter_is_scaring_me_tonight_no_idea_how_to/
17sfgi8,Brain cancer at 16… I’m a mess now.,"Became extremely I’ll at 16 and told my mom “this is gonna be my last birthday.” I said that 4 days before I was told I have brain cancer. Emergency surgery was done to save my life and I’m 21 now. Been cancer free for a few years but the experience still haunts me. Nightmares and panic attacks are common now, and I constantly need reassurance from my family that I’ll be okay. Nerve pain in my skull and my obvious scar are constant reminders of the worst days of my life. My type of cancer can come back up to 10 years after treatment which terrifies me.

1744b37,My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

EDIT: I would also like to add I know it is my mom's right to have sex. I know it's natural, but I just don't like hearing it

EDIT 2: Thank you all for the kind words. You are all so sweet and helpful.",1696888783.0,2023-10-09 21:59:43+00:00,2023,613,75,mentalhealth,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1744b37/my_mother_having_sex_with_me_in_the_same_room/

10bbq3d,Some random guy saved my life today and he didn’t even realize it,"So I hit rock bottom months ago, but I brought a shovel with me and I’ve been getting worse and worse. I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. 

I got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me. 

God is real and he sent this man to save my life",1673659720.0,2023-01-14 01:28:40+00:00,2023,586,48,mentalhealth,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10bbq3d/some_random_guy_saved_my_life_today_and_he_didnt/
18agqtt,"Saw a horrifying disturbing gore video, traumatized","I was scrolling through Twitter when a gore video that some asshole posted to be edgy began to autoplay. There was sound. I will never get those screams out of my head. I was so shocked I kind of froze up and saw much more than I ever wanted to. I don't want to give details, but it was disgusting and of a sexualized nature. Just extremely vile shit. I began having a panic attack and I vomited.

I'm haunted and lying awake at 4 am desperately trying to get the images out of my head. I feel ill. I can't relax, I just keep seeing it every time I close my eyes.. please help, what can I do?

Edit: Oh my goodness, I wasn't expecting so much of a response. You guys are so kind and lovely, and you've made me feel significantly better. Thank you all so much!

I'm going to take your suggestions. I just woke up and have been scrolling r/eyebleach all morning, and it's helping. I unfortunately had awful nightmares, but I'm going to try to distract myself today, play some Tetris and confide in a friend about it.

Also, I deleted Twitter for good. I feel better for it, to be honest.

I'll go through and respond to what I can after I have a shower and decompress a bit. Thank you all again. ♡",1701682691.0,2023-12-04 09:38:11+00:00,2023,580,232,mentalhealth,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18agqtt/saw_a_horrifying_disturbing_gore_video_traumatized/
18mhuud,My best friend died this morning,"My best friend of 11 years died in a car crash that happened last night. He was riding with one of his other friends and he was high while he was driving. My friend was in the back of the truck when it happened. This wasn’t a collision with another car he hit a guard rail and my friend went flying out of the back of the car. He died on impact, but the paramedics were able to resuscitate him. The guy driving ran away in the woods nearby. 

My friend died 3 times before they finally pulled the plug. I hate to imagine the pain he was in. Everyone around me keeps mentioning him and I can’t handle it. We grew up together and now he’s gone. I went to a pawnshop nearby my school while i was waiting for my brother and i met the dad of one of my friends who was also really close to my friend who died. We talked for about 90 minutes before I left.

I am disgusted by how society forces us to ""grow up"" because they force us to be away from the only people I care about--we have to get jobs and work with others, move away, get married, etc. I realize the last two are choices but society still seems to see you as weird if you don't do them. I'm sick and tired of living in a world that wasn't made for me.

15uvaqv,I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

11tyk7d,I just survived a murder attempt by my own mother and i need help,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a 20-year-old woman from Newcastle, UK, and I'm reaching out for help. When I was 16, I moved to the UK with my mother from Poland, and since then, life has been a constant struggle.  
  
My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.  
  
Last year, I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and things took a turn for the worse. Due to COVID, my doctor increased my dose without necessary blood tests, and I became extremely ill. My mother's refusal to pay for my treatment made things worse, and I was suicidal, but I managed to hang on.  
  
Yesterday, my mother had her worst episode yet. While drunk, she threatened me and got very close. Terrified for my safety, I locked the door behind her when she went outside to smoke. Shockingly, she set the garden on fire, knowing it would spread to the house and harm me.  
  
I called the police, and my mother is now in custody. I'm completely alone, with no support, money, or idea of how to move forward. I can't work or study because of my condition.  
  
I'm in desperate need of help and feeling hopeless and ill. i don't know how to survive financially and rebuild after my mother attempt to kill me. I need support
