jnwcov,Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online,"It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/caf√©/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Also, this doubles as a plea to all restaurants- if you didn't alreday do it, I'M BEGGING YOU please post your menus online, whether on your website, your IG story highlights, or in an album on Facebook.",1604495165.0,2020-11-04 13:06:05+00:00,2020,3824,70,anxiety,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jnwcov/can_we_just_have_a_round_of_applause_for/
hqlsf8,At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I‚Äôll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they‚Äôre all worth fixing guys, don‚Äôt ever forget that xx",1594667939.0,2020-07-13 19:18:59+00:00,2020,3662,88,anxiety,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hqlsf8/at_the_end_of_my_first_ever_session_my_therapist/

gnfhvp,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

ghiqy2,Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends.

I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling.

hhi5y0,I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort.

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

jgczkl,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",1603415517.0,2020-10-23 01:11:57+00:00,2020,1784,128,anxiety,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jgczkl/i_absolutely_hate_being_a_highfunctioning_person/
gwfrjt,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds.

gzqpsw,I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm‚Äô.",1591720785.0,2020-06-09 16:39:45+00:00,2020,1748,245,anxiety,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gzqpsw/i_think_i_prefer_depression_over_anxiety/
kk6u2r,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

homwjx,I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",1594378697.0,2020-07-10 10:58:17+00:00,2020,1734,102,anxiety,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/homwjx/i_just_realised_the_reason_i_panic_when_i_make/

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

jroy1r,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

Three months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack.

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed.

gx2ksi,UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work.

ej29di,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

jcwbws,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,"I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

hfk86k,Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?,"Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt absolutely terrified of driving.

gmezo7,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

fbq6n2,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",1583044265.0,2020-03-01 06:31:05+00:00,2020,1329,75,anxiety,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fbq6n2/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_they_are_extremely/

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc. 

I've read of ""Hurry Sickness"" but it feels like that matches people that are actually busy and want to do more things. Im not really a busy person, it's like I'm in a rush to get back to doing nothing.",1594873734.0,2020-07-16 04:28:54+00:00,2020,1289,88,anxiety,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hs368j/does_anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_constantly_in_a/

fxc59w,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don‚Äôt let your imagination get the best of you.",1586371377.0,2020-04-08 18:42:57+00:00,2020,1264,55,anxiety,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fxc59w/remember_the_25_rule_for_social_anxiety/

iicu6b,Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?,"I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven‚Äôt heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here.

f2ej20,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",1581453318.0,2020-02-11 20:35:18+00:00,2020,1236,89,anxiety,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/f2ej20/finally_passed_my_drivers_test_at_25/

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words.

Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

i55qvg,I'm talking to you. Yeah you.,"&#x200B;

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

Fast forward to the next morning, I‚Äôm still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don‚Äôt smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn‚Äôt think this would get as much response as it did. 

I‚Äôve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn‚Äôt even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he‚Äôs sick. He‚Äôs been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It‚Äôs the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It‚Äôs crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I‚Äôm always here to talk!",1606184126.0,2020-11-24 02:15:26+00:00,2020,1193,97,anxiety,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jzw1t3/does_anyone_get_an_uncontrollable_amount_anxiety/
